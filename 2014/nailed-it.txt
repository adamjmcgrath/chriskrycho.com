Title: Nailed It

Yesterday, something rather remarkable happened. Someone leaked a copy of the
trailer for _Avengers: Age of Ultron_... and the company behind the movie,
rather than throwing a hissy fit (and ultimately just making things worse),
played its hand perfectly in a response that was funny *and* demonstrated that
the folks who work there actually understand how the internet works. Marvel's
response to the leak came primarily in the form of two tweets, just a few hours
apart.

> Dammit, Hydra. ([October 22, 7:50 PM EST][hydra])

Pitch perfect. It's self-aware, self-*referential* in a funny way without being
too clever-seeming or coming off like it's trying too hard, and just a generally
good response. That alone would have been good enough to put Marvel in a league
of its own when it comes to managing things *not* going the way hoped for. But
(after what I'm sure was considerable back-room wrangling), they followed it up
an hour and a half later with another different tweet:

> Here it is! Watch the [@Avengers][@av]: [\#AgeofUltron][aou-hash] Teaser
> Trailer right NOW: <http://youtu.be/tmeOjFno6Do> [\#Avengers][av-hash]
> ([October 22, 9:18 PM EST][trailer-tweet])

Your average old-media company these days would have thrown a fit and made a
stink about the release of their media. Many companies *have* done just that
under similar circumstances, aiming to get the trailer, snippets of the movie,
music, or the like removed from the internet. But that simply isn't how the
internet works: it famously "treats censorship like damage and routes around it"
([John Gilmore][censorship]). So rather than fight it... Marvel just rolled with
it and made the best of the situation. They cracked a joke, went ahead and put
the trailer out themselves, and earned general approval from the internet.
Again. In short, despite being a decades-old company, Marvel is now *thoroughly*
a new media company. They managed to dodge the [Streisand effect][streisand]
quite nicely, turning what could have been an opportunity for hostility all
around into a PR coup and a win that they couldn't have scored on their own.

Other old (and new!) media companies, take note. *This* is the way you play the
game. You recognize when the cat is out of the bag and you run with it. Own it.
Make it your own somehow. Don't let it own you. The internet is a big, crazy,
chaotic place, and you can never hope to control it---nor even the narrative
about you and your stuff, whatever that may be---like you might have been able
to do twenty-five years ago. But that's okay. If you can roll with the punches,
you can still come out ahead, and you'll look a little more human doing it. I
call that winning.

(Go Marvel.)
