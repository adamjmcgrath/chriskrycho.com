        I have made it my goal to write short posts reflecting on my devotional
        reading every day. These posts are composed off the cuff, in 30 minutes or
        less. The following is one such post.
            Before writing this post, I read: Ezra 5–10, Psalm 23, Proverbs 23.
    </p>
    <hr/>


        <div class="content">

            <blockquote>
<pre><code>My son, give me your heart,
    and let your eyes observe my ways.
For a prostitue is a deep pit;
    a foreign woman is a narrow well. (Proverbs 23:26--27, ESV)
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p><sup id="fnref:fw"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:fw" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>The latter half of Ezra explains how it is that the people of Israel <a href="/2014/justice-mercy-same-stroke/">turned
away</a> from their pattern of idolatry&#8212;and it
wasn&#8217;t pretty or easy. After the people began building the temple again under
the leadership of Haggai and Zechariah, after the favor shown to the Jews by the
kings Darius and Artaxerxes, and after Ezra made his God-favored journey from
Babylon to Jerusalem bearing more gifts and entrusted to teach the people the
law, everything once again nearly went wrong because of an old pattern the Jews
were embracing. Despite the clear instruction of the Law of Yahweh, they were
intermarrying with the people around&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>The instruction not to intermarry was not racism, even if some abused it to that
end. Those who did missed the point entirely, for Yahweh had always welcomed the
outsider into his people. Indeed, the very existence of Israel was predicated on
Yahweh&#8217;s choosing for himself someone who was <em>not</em> following him. Likewise, the
kingly line had in it multiple outsiders (most notably Rahab and Ruth). No, the
point was not the superiority of the Jews over the people around them&#8212;a notion
that their history should have made clear was laughable in any case&#8212;but the
protection of their <em>worship</em>. Every time that Israelites began intermarrying
with the people around them, they also began following the worship practices of
the people around them. They started worshipping idols, every single&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>Thus, the prohibition on intermarriage was not a matter of racial distinction,
but of religious distinction, and Israel&#8217;s history bore out the necessity of the
policy. Yet in Ezra 9, we find that once again they were slipping into the same
old pattern. Ezra&#8217;s response might be startling without that history. Even apart
from a pattern of this same folly, though, his response is the right one from a
shepherd when God&#8217;s people disobey him. There is a lesson here for pastors and
ministers: Ezra&#8217;s first response was grief and a prayer of corporate repentance.
Only after offering that prayer did he move to deal with the&nbsp;sin.</p>
<p>The mundane<sup id="fnref:mundane"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:mundane" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> response Ezra made is interesting and has been much
debated, given God&#8217;s stated opposition to divorce. While we might speculate
about the outcomes of the decision for the women and children affected by
requiring these Israelite men to put them away, we have no grounds to do so.
Certainly we can say that the right thing for these men to do would have been to
provide for the families they had created, even while no longer having them as
spouses. As to what they actually did, though, we simply have no basis for
speaking one way or another. What we can say with confidence is that Ezra&#8217;s
actions here underscore the seriousness with which he took keeping the Law of
God. Holiness mattered to him&#8212;and not just his own personal holiness, but the
holiness of the people of&nbsp;God.</p>
<p>So it ought to be for us, especially those of us who seek to be teachers and
leaders within the church. If we are to be the bride of Christ, we must seek to
be <em>wholly</em> pure. A bride does not care only that her face and one of her dress
sleeves are white; she cares that her whole appearance is radiant and beautiful
when she meets her groom. So let us diligently pursue both our own holiness and
that of our brothers and sisters in&nbsp;Christ.</p>

<p>I have chosen &#8220;mundane&#8221; rather than &#8220;practical&#8221; because the two are
not the same, and the latter would imply that Ezra&#8217;s prayer was not practical,
