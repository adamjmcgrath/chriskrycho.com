Today, I was happy to be able to finally go public with a project on which I have been working for the last couple months (and for which I have been planning since mid-fall): [Winning Slowly](http://www.winningslowly.org/). Winning Slowly is a biweeklypodcast by yours truly and my good friend [Stephen Carradini](http://stephencarradini.com) offering thoughtful commentary on trends in culture, technology, religion, ethics, and art.

Of possible interest to my readers:

- You can listen to the first episode, [We Need Some Context!](http://www.winningslowly.org/2014/01/we-need-some-context/)
- You can [subscribe to the feed](http://www.winningslowly.org/feed.xml).
- You can follow and get updates via all sorts of social networks:
	* Twitter: [@winningslowly](https://twitter.som/winningslowly)
	* App.net: [@winningslowly](http://app.net/winningslowly)
	* [App.net broadcast](http://broadcast.app.net/40022/winning-slowly-episodes/) -- notifications on your phone or emails as you like
	* [Google+](https://plus.google.com/u/0/+WinningslowlyOrgCast/) (yes, shockingly enough)

We're still very much in a "beta" phase. The audio quality needs significant improvement, our back-and-forth needs to get smoother (and, at times, more back-and-forth!), and so on. We'd love to hear your feedback. But be gentle.
