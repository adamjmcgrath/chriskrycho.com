===============

Here I version control my website. Everything is public, because anything I have
here is *already* public. Moreover, all of this material is provided open source
so that others can learn from, remix, and otherwise make use of it. There is
just one restriction on that: if you're going to use the material, please do me
the favor of crediting me for it. That's just being kind. For the legalese, see
the `LICENSE` file.

So... now what?
---------------

To see how the site *works*, look at the `master` branch, which has the
[Pelican] configuration, [Jinja2] templates, etc., as well as all the Markdown
files which constitute the content of the site (but before conversion).

To get the site itself, look at the `gh-pages` branch. Because of the way
[Pelican] and [GitHub Pages] play together, you can actually check out the site
from any point in time since I started hosting it. That's only mildly 
interesting (at best!) from a content perspective, but it may be interesting if
you are curious to see how the design aesthetic of the site has changed over
time.
