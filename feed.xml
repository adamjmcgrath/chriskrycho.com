The psalm opens with a declaration of
God&amp;#8217;s worthiness of praise and a statement of his atonement&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and
righteousness on behalf of his saints, then moves to a depiction of his power in
creation. For some reason, I expected the Psalmist to move the other direction
if he were going to bring these two things together in a single Psalm. Perhaps
it is the way we often tell the story in explaining the gospel&amp;#8212;creation, fall,
redemption, restoration&amp;#8212;but moving from salvation from sins and reconciliation
with God to creation caught me off&amp;nbsp;guard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So often, I fall into a bad habit of separating the attributes of God&amp;#8212;as
though God were a collection of properties and not &lt;em&gt;persons&lt;/em&gt; who all share in
the same nature. We cannot separate his creative nature from his saving love for
us any more than we can separate the same kinds of things in ourselves. Do I
write poetry for my wife because I am creative,&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; or because I am loving?
Both, of course: any split between the two is a false disjunction. When I write
her a poem, I am drawing on multiple facets of my personality and exercising
multiple faculties and bending my will to accomplish one end &lt;em&gt;through&lt;/em&gt; another
end. One can write poetry for its own sake, and one can love one&amp;#8217;s wife without
poetry, and one can write poetry for one&amp;#8217;s wife. Bringing the two together is no
strange&amp;nbsp;thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it is with God, and so this psalm reminds us. God creates because he is
creative, and also he creates because of his love for his creatures. He
delighted to make a good world for us. In creation he demonstrates his power and
his wisdom, and in creation he also demonstrates his deep and abiding affection
for those whom he created. The particularity of God&amp;#8217;s relationship to his
covenant people (&amp;#8220;God in Zion,&amp;#8221; Psalm 65:1) is inseparable from his relationship
to all the world (&amp;#8220;the hope of all the ends of the earth,&amp;#8221; 65:5). Then, when the
Psalmist moves from the specificity of God-in-Zion&amp;#8217;s redemption for iniquities
to the fact that he created the world and maintains it, he shows us the unity of
God&amp;#8217;s love and the inseparability of his actions. It is not as if God provides
rain for all the world out of duty or obligation; he does so because he delights
to do good toward we his children&amp;#8212;even in our rebellion! The result is that
&amp;#8220;those who dwell at the ends of the earth are in awe at [his] signs&amp;#8221; (65:8).
God&amp;#8217;s atonement, reconciling his people, doing righteousness and justice, and
his creative and sustaining power in creation all come around to the same end:
the world worshipping him, the world in right relation with&amp;nbsp;him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So with David, and with the meadows, I want to &amp;#8220;shout and sing together for joy&amp;#8221;
(65:13) at all the works of the God in Zion. It is good to be&amp;nbsp;surprised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not the point of today&amp;#8217;s meditations, but nonetheless worth note: contra
many an overly simplified evangelical presentation of the relationship
between the eras before and after the Incarnation, Old Testament believers
relied on God for their salvation from sins just as we do. They knew that he
was the one who atoned for them (Psalm 65:3) and that it was he who brought
them near, not the other way around (Psalm 65:4).&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No claim here that I am particularly &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; at poetry, mind, but Jaimie
seems to like it, and that is good enough for me.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

internet. I read, to be sure, and every once in a long while I even go on a
spree where I follow links from one site to another (or just in a long trail on
Wikipedia). In general, however, I no longer surf. I suspect I am not alone in
this: if we took a straw poll I would venture that most of my friends offline
and acquaintances online alike spend rather less time in &amp;#8220;browsing&amp;#8221; mode than
they do reading Facebook or Twitter or Instagram. Motion from link to link has
been replaced by individual hops out onto Buzzfeed or a viral cat picture
website.&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The obvious explanation for all of this is already there in what I&amp;#8217;ve written:
Facebook and Twitter and all the rest of the social media web. To be sure, the
advent of social media and the increasing degree to which social media have
captured user attention on the web are a significant factor in the end of the
old surfing/browsing behavior. This is a dream come true for those social media
giants which have found ways to deliver ads to their many millions of users and
thereby turn enormous&amp;nbsp;profits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, I think there is an oft-overlooked factor in the shifting
nature of the web over the last decade: the browser. In fact, if there is any
single cause behind the death of old-fashioned surfing, I would point to Firefox
1.0: the browser which popularized tabbed browsing to increasingly large
sections of the internet-using public.&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The open-source browser steadily ate
away at Internet Explorer&amp;#8217;s then absurd levels of dominance, until Internet
Explorer 8 included of tabs itself. By the time that Chrome came on the scene,
tabbed browsing had long since become a&amp;nbsp;given.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why do I think that &lt;em&gt;tabbed browsing&lt;/em&gt; of all things contributed to the end of
&amp;#8220;browsing&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;surfing&amp;#8221; as our dominant mode of reading the internet? Simply
put: it broke linearity. Previously,&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; one&amp;#8217;s experience of the web was single-
stranded, leaping from one point to another in a line that however contorted was
always connected by the forward and backward buttons on the browser. The moment
tabbed browsing came on the scene, that line was broken. Following a link might
mean it opened in a new tab instead of moving the whole view forward to&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surfing as I remember it in the late &amp;rsquo;90s and early &amp;rsquo;00s was
inherently the experience of getting lost along that timeline, finding myself
dozens of links along the chain and wondering how I had ended up there, and then
being able to trace my way back. With tabs, that traceability was gone. With it
went the inherent tension that we faced with every link: to follow, or not? To
get sucked down into &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; vortex or &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;? Because in all likelihood, we
knew, we were not going to be coming back to this page. With tabs, though, I
could open both of those pages without ever leaving this one. I could start new
journeys without ending the old. But there was a hidden cost: that newly opened
tab had no history. It was a clean slate; before that newly opened link there
was only a blank page. If I closed the original from which I had opened it,
there was no going back.&lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; If I closed this new tabs, there was no going
forward to them. The line was&amp;nbsp;broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there it was only a short step to the idea of a single site being the
center from which one ventured out to other points on the web before returning:
the Facebooks and Twitters of the world. In some sense, Facebook&amp;#8217;s entire model
is predicated on the idea that it is natural to open a new tab with that juicy
Buzzfeed content while keeping Facebook itself open in a background tab. Would
it work in that old linear model? Sort of. Would it feel natural?&amp;nbsp;Never.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this because of tabs. Invention&amp;#8217;s most significant results are rarely
those the minds behind it expect. When we are designing things&amp;#8212;whether a piece
of furniture or a piece of the web&amp;#8212;we have to remember that design decisions
all have repercussions that we may not see. Technology is never neutral.
Particular innovations may or may not be &lt;em&gt;morally&lt;/em&gt; significant, but they always
produce changes in people&amp;#8217;s behavior. Design has&amp;nbsp;consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the record, lots of that hopping from link to link was on Buzzfeed-
like and viral-cat-picture-like sites, too. I am not concerned with the
&lt;em&gt;kind&lt;/em&gt; of content being read here, so much as the way it is being read.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that I am not crediting Firefox 1.0 with &lt;em&gt;creating&lt;/em&gt; the tabbed
browser&amp;#8212;only with popularizing it. That distinction matters.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excepting having multiple browser windows open, which I am sure people
did&amp;#8212;but to a much lesser extent.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:4"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, yes, browser history and re-open closed tab commands. But the
&lt;em&gt;experience&lt;/em&gt; of those is different, and that&amp;#8217;s what we&amp;#8217;re talking about
here.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:4" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

some reflection. Perhaps by the time I am done writing, I will see a&amp;nbsp;connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6 id="psalm-64"&gt;Psalm&amp;nbsp;64&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading through the Psalms often serves as a reminder for me that the easy way
of life I enjoy is not normal either in historical terms or in normative terms
for the people of God. Suffering and opposition are &lt;em&gt;ordinary&lt;/em&gt;, so much so that
prayers for deliverance from the plots of the enemies of God are themselves
ordinary in the Psalms. Certainly for David such things were a regular part of
his life, and so it has been for many believers throughout the ages, and so it
is today for many around the&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Psalm does not stop with the acknowledgement that there are people in the
world would do God&amp;#8217;s people harm, though. It moves immediately on to the reality
that God delivers his people. The inversion is striking: those who lay in
ambush, who &amp;#8220;shoot arrows&amp;#8221; at the innocent find &lt;em&gt;God&amp;#8217;s&lt;/em&gt; arrows coming for them
(Psalm 64:4,7). In the small narrative arc this song traces out, the ambushers
who set out to destroy the righteous are themselves destroyed. Their destruction
leads all the world to magnify God. The righteous rejoice in Yahweh, take refuge
in him, and&amp;nbsp;exult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It strikes me that in a way, this arc is a very short telling of the arc of
history itself. The enemies of God have a time in which they can work, but
ultimately they will be ended, and all the earth will be filled with the glory
of&amp;nbsp;Yahweh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6 id="proverbs-26"&gt;Proverbs&amp;nbsp;26&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first half of this chapter is a sequence of comparisons: increasingly
terrible or ridiculous things with a fool.&lt;sup id="fnref:2-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-1" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The fact that the fool comes
off looking absurd is the point&amp;#8212;so that when we get to Proverbs 26:12, the
conclusion is all the more&amp;nbsp;forceful:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you see a man who is wise in his own eyes?&lt;br /&gt;
There is more hope for a fool than for&amp;nbsp;him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As bad as it is to be a fool&amp;#8212;a point that both the book as a whole and the
preceding ten verses have labored to make clear&amp;#8212;being wise in one&amp;#8217;s own eyes
is even worse.&lt;sup id="fnref:2-2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-2" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The book has made clear over and over again that there is
basically no hope for a fool, though Wisdom is still inviting even fools to turn
from their ways (Proverbs 8:5). But for the man who is wise in his own eyes,
what recourse is there?&lt;sup id="fnref:2-3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-3" rel="footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6 id="first-corinthians-4-6"&gt;First Corinthians&amp;nbsp;4&amp;#8211;6&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What better picture of reliance on one&amp;#8217;s own wisdom than the church at Corinth?
One can nearly see Paul tearing his hair out over this church, which seemed
determined to run off into the weeds in every possible way. By the end of
chapter 6, he has already addressed factionalism, sexual immorality of an
extraordinary sort, and Christians suing each other in court. Moreover, he has
had to deal with the fact that they considered themselves wiser than the
apostles (basically throughout all of chapter 4). Following this so-called
wisdom was destroying&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few highlights that particularly caught my attention&amp;nbsp;here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paul admonished his audience to judge themselves rightly, but to remember
   that even in their own self-judgment they had to acknowledge that God alone
   knows all our&amp;nbsp;faults.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As for outsiders, the church was not to &amp;#8220;judge&amp;#8221; them, leaving that to God.
   Judgment here must imply something besides moral assessment, however, because
   Paul explicitly calls out the follies of the unregenerate world (e.g. sexual
   immorality, greed, swindling, idolatry&amp;#8212;see 1 Corinthians 5:10). It means
   rather that the Corinthians&amp;#8217; response was not to be the rejection enjoined of
   them as regarded unrepentant people in their own midst. The church exercises
   discipline on its members, not on the&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When Paul encourages the Corinthians to reject sexual immorality, he grounds
   it in the resurrection. Indeed, Paul turns to the resurrection about as often
   (and perhaps more often) as to the cross in this book&amp;#8212;a point &lt;span class="caps"&gt;N. T.
&lt;/span&gt;  Wright&amp;#8217;s delightful and excellent &lt;em&gt;The Resurrection of the Son of God&lt;/em&gt; makes
   forcefully. God raised Jesus from the dead, and he will raise us from the
   dead, so we ought to regard our bodies accordingly. They are temples of God
   indwelt by the Spirit, and ultimately destined for glory. &lt;em&gt;That&lt;/em&gt; is why we
   ought to flee sexual&amp;nbsp;immorality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interrupting the sequence is the classic wisdom paradox of the book:
Proverbs 26:4&amp;#8211;5, withits paired injunctions to answer and not to answer a fool
according to his folly.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2-1" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rhetorical force of the placement of this particular set of proverbs
near the end of the book, as well as the structure of this section, is one of
many arguments for a coherent editorial strategy in the creation of Proverbs.
All you have to do is read the book to get this.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2-2" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2-3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This verse is one of the keys in my understanding of Ecclesiastes:
&lt;em&gt;Qoheleth&lt;/em&gt; was wise in his own eyes, and it nearly destroyed him.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2-3" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been common these past few years to speak of &amp;#8220;incarnational theology&amp;#8221; as a way of describing the Christian mission to the world: we ought to &amp;#8220;incarnate&amp;#8221; Christ to the world as Christ &amp;#8220;incarnated&amp;#8221; the Godhead to us. There is much to appreciate in this sentiment&amp;#8230;. Yet for all that, I think that applying the language of incarnation to believers is a serious&amp;nbsp;mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Incarnation matters, and it matters as more than a means of getting Jesus to the cross so that he could die for our sins. We evangelicals too often reduce everything to penal substitutionary atonement. Yes, the atonement is incredible and amazing. It is one of the central affirmations and joys of the Christian faith: our sins are paid for! Glory to God! But Jesus did more than that, and he is worthy of yet more praise. He did not stop at paying the price for our sins while leaving our bodies subject to corruption. He did not content himself with performing a judicial act while leaving our wills broken, certain to turn again to the same sin that led to our death in the first&amp;nbsp;place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think &lt;a href="http://mereorthodoxy.com/god-become-man-richer-theology-incarnation/"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; is the best thing I&amp;#8217;ve written so far this year; I hope you find it&amp;nbsp;stimulating.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chris Krycho</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2014 08:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:www.chriskrycho.com,2014-03-25:2014/god-become-man-toward-a-richer-theology-of-the-incarnation.html</guid><category>links</category></item><item><title>Surprising Unity</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/surprising-unity.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;The surprising unity&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; of the church has been a recurring theme on my mind
lately. Reading through 1 Corinthians was sure to bring the notion back to the
forefront, of course: the book has several prominent topics, but unity is the
one to which Paul returns again and again and the one with which he opens the
book. The first few chapters are an indictment of the Corinthians for their
factionalism, punctuated&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; by a theological grounding for that&amp;nbsp;indictment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of structure, Paul&amp;#8217;s epistles to the Corinthians are fairly unique
among his writings. Unlike the normal structure of his letters, in which there
are fairly clear divisions between expository and hortatory material (though
with the requisite qualification that he is often including some exhortations
during the exposition and vice versa), his letters to the Corinthians are
constantly jumping back and forth between the two. He makes a point, grounds it
in the nature of the gospel, and then repeats. First Corinthians circles back to
the theme of unity over and over again in this&amp;nbsp;fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1 Corinthians 1:18&amp;#8211;2, Paul explains the call to unity he laid out in chapter
1 and to which he returns in chapter 3 in terms of Christ&amp;#8217;s and the Spirit&amp;#8217;s
work. What Christ did looked like an incomprehensible weakness to the Jews who
were expecting their messiah to come in power, and incomprehensible folly to the
Greeks who expected any true leader to come in a demonstration of wisdom. Both
of these Jesus set on their heads. In this surprising inversion&amp;#8212;so typical of
Christ&amp;#8217;s work&amp;#8212;is forged the grounds for Christian unity. None of us have cause
for boasting; God is our wisdom and our power, our righteousness and
sanctification and&amp;nbsp;redemption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this is accomplished in our midst by the Spirit. Not only do we have
nothing apart from Jesus Christ, but we cannot even rightly appropriate him and
what he offers on our own. This strength and wisdom we have in Christ is
mediated by the Spirit of God. What Paul taught, he taught not in human wisdom
by &amp;#8220;by the Spirit&amp;#8221; (1 Corinthians 2:13), and only those who were empowered by
the Spirit could understand them. They were (and are) folly to anyone who is
operating in human understanding alone.&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unity of the church, which is one of the ways that the world knows us as
Christ&amp;#8217;s (per the Gospel of John) is, like everything in our faith ultimately a
gift from the Triune God. We must actively obey the call to unity, and it will
not happen without our effort, but it is Father-given, Son-mediated, Spirit-
empowered obedience to walk in a Father-given, Son-mediated, Spirit-empowered
way. In some sense, this is &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of our sanctification: learning more and more
to obey in humble dependence on God who is our all in&amp;nbsp;all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A phrase I borrowed from one our pastors at First Baptist Durham, Dr. Andy

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can almost think of the structure as analogous to a sentence with
content set off by an em-dash&amp;#8212;like so, with some explanatory comment here
in the middle&amp;#8212;and then continuing to a conclusion. Yes, that&amp;#8217;s an absurdly
nerdy comparison.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One might suggest that the issue is &lt;em&gt;fallen&lt;/em&gt; human understanding, and this
is right so far as it goes&amp;#8230; but the reason fallen human understanding
fails is because it is not reliant on God. Unfallen, or restored, human
understanding is wise precisely because it fears Yahweh (cf. Proverbs 1:7).&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The chapters
sweep from the Jewish leaders&amp;#8217; plot with Judas to get Jesus&amp;#8217; turned over to
them, through Jesus&amp;#8217; celebration of the Passover with his disciples,&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; through
his prayers in the garden and betrayal by Judas, through his multiple farcical
trials, through his brutal crucifixion and death, to his resurrection from the
dead and revelation of himself as the Anointed One of God to his disciples.
Luke&amp;#8217;s narrative up to this point has a fairly measured pace, with a great deal
of time devoted to long stretches of Jesus&amp;#8217; teaching, but here at the climax
event piles on event in a way that seems designed to take one&amp;#8217;s breath away.
&lt;em&gt;Here&lt;/em&gt; is the finale toward which Jesus had been pointing ever since the &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/lukes-hinge.html"&gt;hinge
in the book&lt;/a&gt; back in the ninth chapter: his death and&amp;nbsp;resurrection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few observations that particularly stood out to me today. First, when Jesus
instituted the Lord&amp;#8217;s Supper, he also told his disciples of the betrayal that
would shortly come at one of their hands, and they were troubled. They &amp;#8220;began to
question one another, which of them it could be who was going to do this&amp;#8221; (Luke
22:23). What Luke drops in next is a surprise:&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; at the same time, they
started arguing about who was the greatest (22:24). They did not recognize that
the same basic impulse that would motivate one of them to betray the one they
confessed as Lord and Messiah&amp;#8212;fallen human self-absorption and
self-interest&amp;#8212;also motivated this discussion of greatness. Jesus upends this,
pointing out here that he had come &amp;#8220;as the one who serves&amp;#8221; (22:7). Their reward
would be greater than any of them could wish: being enthroned beside him to
judge the twelve tribes of Israel&amp;#8212;but because they had stayed with him in his
trials, not because of their own inherent greatness&amp;nbsp;(22:28&amp;#8211;30).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus instructed the disciples to sell a cloak to buy a sword, learned that they
had a pair of swords, and told them that it was enough (22:37&amp;#8211;38). Then, when
the disciples actually went to use those swords, Jesus forbade them, and undid
what they had done. It is almost as if he made sure that they had the swords
there precisely so that he could teach this object lesson. The Anointed One of
God came not to kill but to be killed, just as he had come not to be served but
to&amp;nbsp;serve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his trial, Jesus simply did not answer his accusers. They took his silence,
and his acknowledgment that they were accusing him, as all the proof they
needed. Why? Because they needed no more proof than their accusations.
Interestingly, both Herod and Pilate clearly abuse their authority, causing
Jesus to be mocked and beaten even while admitting that they found nothing for
which he ought to be punished (still less crucified). Pilate in particular comes
off looking terrible: he repeatedly tells the crowd that he can see no reason
why Jesus ought to be crucified, and that he intends to let him go, but caves to
the pressure of the crowd (23:1&amp;#8211;25). The fear of man can lead us to do wretched
things. Pilate decided to release a murderer and insurrectionist&amp;#8212;the latter
being precisely the crime of which Jesus was accused!&amp;#8212;instead of an innocent
man, because of the demands of a&amp;nbsp;crowd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barabbas himself strikes me as an interesting figure in Luke&amp;#8217;s narrative. He was
what Jesus was accused of being, and he went free with Jesus taking his place.
Every time I read through this passage, it strikes me again that Luke gave us
here a clear picture of the substitutionary work of Christ on our behalf. Here
we have a man who clearly deserved his punishment under the law of his day,
going free with Jesus being punished instead. I have no idea whether Barabbas
ever truly appreciated what happened to him, by which I mean whether he repented
of his sins and believed in the one who was his substitute in more ways than
one. I do know that the picture, especially when set side by side with Paul&amp;#8217;s
teaching on the topic, reminds me that &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; am like Barabbas in the story: set
free because of Jesus&amp;#8217; going in my&amp;nbsp;stead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I love reading the narratives of the resurrection. It was then as it is
now: too good to be true, almost too good to be believed. The disciples, though
Jesus had taught them that he would die and be resurrected, simply did not grasp
his meaning. Even when they were told that he had been raised, they did not
believe it until he showed himself to them&amp;#8212;and then they thought they saw a
ghost until he convinced them by eating some fish! The resurrection was in no
one&amp;#8217;s game plan but God&amp;#8217;s. But now it is our future hope and our joyful
expectation as well. And it is because of the resurrection from the dead that
they went, and that we go to proclaim repentance and forgiveness of sins in
Jesus&amp;#8217; name to all nations (Luke&amp;nbsp;24:46&amp;#8211;47).&lt;/p&gt;

make a static site generator that would tick of all the little boxes marking my
desires for a website generator. In due time, the project got put on hold, as I
started up classes again and needed to focus more on my family than on fun side&amp;nbsp;projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come the beginning of 2014, I was ready to bit WordPress farewell once and for
all, though. While &lt;a href="https://ghost.org"&gt;Ghost&lt;/a&gt; looks interesting, since I do all my writing
in Markdown files, there is something tempting about the canonical version of
the documents being the version on my computer (and thus also on my iPad and
iPhone and anywhere I have Dropbox and/or Git access). I did not have time at
the beginning of the year to finish writing Step Stool, and I knew as much,&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
so instead I moved to &lt;a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.3.0/"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt; as a stop-gap. There were lots of good
reasons to pick Pelican: it has an active development community, fairly thorough
documentation,&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and it&amp;#8217;s in Python and uses Jinja2 templates&amp;#8212;the same basic
approach I had taken with Step Stool, and the same&amp;nbsp;toolset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, while I have been glad to be away from WordPress, my experience
with Pelican so far has only reinforced my desire to get Step Stool done. There
are &lt;em&gt;lots&lt;/em&gt; of little things that it does in ways that just annoy me. Many of
them have to do with configuration and documentation. On the latter, while the
documentation is &lt;em&gt;fairly&lt;/em&gt; complete, there are quite a few holes and gaps. (Yes,
yes, open source software and anyone can add to the docs. That&amp;#8217;s great&amp;#8212;it
really is&amp;#8212;but if I&amp;#8217;m going to use someone else&amp;#8217;s solution, it had better &lt;em&gt;just
work&lt;/em&gt;. Otherwise, I&amp;#8217;d rather spend my time getting my own&amp;nbsp;going.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if you want to see how the pagination actually works, good luck
figuring it out from the documentation. You&amp;#8217;ll need to go looking at the way the
sample themes (yes, both of them) are implemented to start getting a feel for
it. Along the same lines, many of the objects that get handed to the templates
are not fully documented, so it is difficult to know what one can or cannot do.
I do not particularly want to spend my time adding debug print statements to my
templates just to figure out what options I have&amp;nbsp;available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same kinds of things hold true for configuration options. Moreover, the
configuration is done through a Python module. While that makes the module
easier to integrate on the code side of things, it makes its actual content much
less transparent than one might hope. Python is not really well optimized for
writing configuration files&amp;#8212;nor is any normal programming language.
Configuration is inherently declarative, rather than&amp;nbsp;imperative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that Pelican is bad software. It is not. It is, however, a
fairly typical example of open source software implemented by committee. It has
holes (some of them serious), bumps, and quirks. Here is the reality: so will
Step Stool, though they will be the quirks that come from an individual
developer&amp;#8217;s approach rather than a group&amp;#8217;s. But the one thing I can guarantee,
and the reason I am increasingly motivated to get back to working on Step Stool.
And yes, I do have a couple other projects on my plate as well&amp;#8212;contributions
to the Smartypants and Typogrify modules, my own &lt;a href="https://bitbucket.org/chriskrycho/spacewell"&gt;Spacewell typography project&lt;/a&gt;,
and quite possibly a &lt;a href="https://bitbucket.org/chriskrycho/markdown-poetry/"&gt;Markdown Poetry extension &lt;/a&gt;. But I would like
very much to just get back to doing this myself. There is freedom in rolling my
own solution to things. I will not always have time to do these kinds of things; 
I figure I should do them when I&amp;nbsp;can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;#8217;s to &lt;a href="http://step-stool.io"&gt;Step Stool&lt;/a&gt;, and&amp;#8212;more importantly&amp;#8212;to writing your own
software just to scratch that&amp;nbsp;itch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent quite a bit of time tweaking my friend Vernon King&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="http://www.vernonking.org"&gt;Jekyll-powered site&lt;/a&gt;, I got Winning Slowly off the ground,
including designing the site from scratch and implementing it (also in Pelican),
and I did some substantial redesign work on this site. That was more than enough
for my three week break&amp;#8212;as evidenced by the fact that I didn&amp;#8217;t get to the sort
of 1.0 version of this site until just a week or so ago.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emphasis on &amp;#8220;fairly.&amp;#8221; More on &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; in a moment as well.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As I was cleaning up the dishes and playing Max Richter&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/memoryhouse/id545010150"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Memoryhouse&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; album, I saw Ellie dancing, and encouraged her to keep going. After a moment, I looked over to see her spinning in circles. And spinning in circles. And spinning in circles. When she finally stopped, she started freaking out as she couldn&amp;#8217;t get her balance. I swooped in and picked her up, laughing with her once she&amp;nbsp;recovered.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After she calmed down, she started tugging on my shirt. It took me a few seconds to realize what she wanted, but then it clicked: she was trying to turn me by twisting my shirt. &amp;#8220;You want to spin?&amp;#8221; I asked her. She nodded vigorously. &amp;#8220;Is this a spinning song?&amp;#8221; Again, the vigorous nod. So I started spinning around and around with her in my arms, and the sheer joy in the grin plastered across her face was something to behold. We spun first one way, then the other, all the way through &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfoSv8iWA_I"&gt;&amp;#8220;The Twins (Prague)&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moments like these are worth&amp;nbsp;remembering.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chris Krycho</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 20 Mar 2014 19:10:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:www.chriskrycho.com,2014-03-20:2014/spinning.html</guid><category>family</category><category>Ellie</category></item><item><title>Money Parables and Divorce and Remarriage</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/money-parables-and-divorce-and-remarriage.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I have said it before and I will say it again: I really quite detest the heading
text in modern English Bible translations. That might seem a strange way to open
a devotions post, but it connects. Trust&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was reading through Luke 14, 15, and 16 this morning, trying to put the
various pieces of the narratives together in the way that Luke intended.
Whenever I am reading, I am always trying to understand the text &lt;em&gt;as a text&lt;/em&gt;,
because that is how it was created and how God inspired it. The words we read
are not abstract things, magic talismanic elements we can mix together as we
please. The authors did things intentionally, as any good author does, and if
we are paying attention, we will learn things from the construction of the
books as we read them.&lt;sup id="fnref:books"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:books" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there I was, working my way through Luke 16, and I came to a verse about
which I have thought a great deal because of its implications for pastoral
ministry, laid out thus in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESV&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8230;it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one dot of the
Law to become&amp;nbsp;void.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="divorce-and-remarriage"&gt;Divorce and&amp;nbsp;Remarriage&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery, and he
who marries a woman divroced from her husband commits&amp;nbsp;adultery.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="the-rich-man-and-lazarus"&gt;The Rich Man and&amp;nbsp;Lazarus&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;There was a rich&amp;nbsp;man&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212;Luke&amp;nbsp;16:17&amp;#8211;19a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On its face, Luke 16:18 is fairly straightforward&amp;#8212;granting that the amount of
ink spilled over the issues of divorce and remarriage means it is not &lt;em&gt;totally&lt;/em&gt;
straightforward. But the straightforwardness of the statement is much diminished
if we separate out those headings and situate the verse in its broader context.
Here is the whole chapter (which is &lt;em&gt;perhaps&lt;/em&gt; just enough context). I have
bolded 16:18 below, and removed all the headings. To feel the full force of the
issue, I really do recommend you read the whole&amp;nbsp;thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also said to the disciples, &amp;#8220;There was a rich man who had a manager, and
charges were brought to him that this man was wasting his possessions. And he
called him and said to him, &amp;#8216;What is this that I hear about you? Turn in the
account of your management, for you can no longer be manager.&amp;#8217; And the manager
said to himself, &amp;#8216;What shall I do, since my master is taking the management
away from me? I am not strong enough to dig, and I am ashamed to beg. I have
decided what to do, so that when I am removed from management, people may
receive me into their houses.&amp;#8217; So, summoning his master&amp;#8217;s debtors one by one,
he said to the first, &amp;#8216;How much do you owe my master?&amp;#8217; He said, &amp;#8216;A hundred
measures of oil.&amp;#8217; He said to him, &amp;#8216;Take your bill, and sit down quickly and
write fifty.&amp;#8217; Then he said to another, &amp;#8216;And how much do you owe?&amp;#8217; He said, &amp;#8216;A
hundred measures of wheat.&amp;#8217; He said to him, &amp;#8216;Take your bill, and write
eighty.&amp;#8217; The master commended the dishonest manager for his shrewdness. For
the sons of this world are more shrewd in dealing with their own generation
than the sons of light. And I tell you, make friends for yourselves by means
of unrighteous wealth, so that when it fails they may receive you into the
eternal&amp;nbsp;dwellings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;One who is faithful in a very little is also faithful in much, and one who is
dishonest in a very little is also dishonest in much. If then you have not
been faithful in the unrighteous wealth, who will entrust to you the true
riches? And if you have not been faithful in that which is another&amp;#8217;s, who will
give you that which is your own? No servant can serve two masters, for either
he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and
despise the other. You cannot serve God and&amp;nbsp;money.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pharisees, who were lovers of money, heard all these things, and they
 ridiculed him. And he said to them, &amp;#8220;You are those who justify yourselves
 before men, but God knows your hearts. For what is exalted among men is an
 abomination in the sight of&amp;nbsp;God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;The Law and the Prophets were until John; since then the good news of the
 kingdom of God is preached, and everyone forces his way into it. But it is
 easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one dot of the Law to
 become&amp;nbsp;void.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery, and
 he who marries a woman divorced from her husband commits&amp;nbsp;adultery.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;There was a rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen and who
 feasted sumptuously every day. And at his gate was laid a poor man named
 Lazarus, covered with sores, who desired to be fed with what fell from the
 rich man&amp;#8217;s table. Moreover, even the dogs came and licked his sores. The poor
 man died and was carried by the angels to Abraham&amp;#8217;s side. The rich man also
 died and was buried, and in Hades, being in torment, he lifted up his eyes
 and saw Abraham far off and Lazarus at his side. And he called out, &amp;#8216;Father
 Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus to dip the end of his finger in
 water and cool my tongue, for I am in anguish in this flame.&amp;#8217; But Abraham
 said, &amp;#8216;Child, remember that you in your lifetime received your good things,
 and Lazarus in like manner bad things; but now he is comforted here, and you
 are in anguish. And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm has
 been fixed, in order that those who would pass from here to you may not be
 able, and none may cross from there to us.&amp;#8217; And he said, &amp;#8216;Then I beg you,
 father, to send him to my father&amp;#8217;s house—for I have five brothers—so that he
 may warn them, lest they also come into this place of torment.&amp;#8217; But Abraham
 said, &amp;#8216;They have Moses and the Prophets; let them hear them.&amp;#8217; And he said,
 &amp;#8216;No, father Abraham, but if someone goes to them from the dead, they will
 repent.&amp;#8217; He said to him, &amp;#8216;If they do not hear Moses and the Prophets, neither
 will they be convinced if someone should rise from the&amp;nbsp;dead.&amp;#8217;&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What in the &lt;em&gt;world&lt;/em&gt; is this passage on divorce and remarriage doing in the
middle of a discussion about handling wealth? Every other piece here fits
together in a fairly obvious fashion. The parable about the rich man and Lazarus
is clearly a rejoinder to the Pharisees attitude toward money. That attitude in
turn was exposed by the Pharisees&amp;#8217; response to another parable about the
relatively value of wealth in this life. Sandwiched between the two is this
statement about divorce and remarriage&amp;#8212;one that would seem perfectly clear on
its own, but which set against the backdrop of this discussion on money seems
to be aiming at something other than divorce and remarriage&amp;nbsp;alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In truth, I am not entirely sure &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; Luke is doing here. My first guess, and
one that Jaimie suggested as well when I pointed this out to her this morning,
is that he is highlighting the way Jesus takes the law in contrast to the
Pharisees. Whereas they were concerned with keeping the law in letter, he was
concerned with the principle of the law. This is the same rhetorical move he
makes in Matthew&amp;#8217;s recounting of the Sermon on the Mount with this same issue,
heightening the sense of the law by sharpening its demands on the listeners.
&amp;#8220;Here, you &amp;#8216;righteous&amp;#8217; Pharisees,&amp;#8221; Jesus seems to be saying, &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;ll see your
legal requirements and raise you double that&amp;#8221;&amp;#8212;just before he goes on to
hammer away yet more at their self-righteousness. That, in turn, makes the
parables before and after this that much more convicting, that much more of a
&lt;a href="/2014/sell-your-possessions-and-give-to-the-needy.html"&gt;heart check&lt;/a&gt;. That is to the&amp;nbsp;good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In truth, I am still not &lt;em&gt;sure&lt;/em&gt; that is what is going on here; tomorrow I intend
to spend some time looking at this issue in the commentaries. But the heading
obscures that there is even a point to be seen here. I nearly missed it this
morning. I &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; missed it in the past, nearly every time I read through this
section. I am therefore all the more strongly resolved to read the books of the
Bible as books&amp;#8212;to find ways to get away from the headings, whenever possible,
and let the text be the text, as it was written and as it was&amp;nbsp;inspired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make the point a bit more forcefully: Can you imagine taking apart
Shakespeare and trying to understand one couplet from a sonnet apart from
the rest of the sonnet? Or trying to understand Eliot&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;Four Quartets&lt;/em&gt; by
reading a line here and a line there? It would be absurd and laughable, and
rightly so.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:books" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you run in certain Facebook circles, you’ve likely already read that North
Korean leader Kim Jung-un has called for the execution of 33 North Korean
Christians. According to the widely circulated reports, these 33 people were
detained after it was discovered they had ties to Kim Jung-wook, a South
Korean missionary whose arrest for religious activity last year has made
international&amp;nbsp;headlines&amp;#8230;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here’s the thing: No one can verify this call for executions actually took&amp;nbsp;place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great example of journalism done right, and of how Christians ought to carry
ourselves in the public square. It matters whether our facts are right or not&amp;#8212;
even when the &amp;#8220;message&amp;#8221; might be right either way. The &lt;a href="http://christandpopculture.com/33-christians-north-korea-really-execution/"&gt;whole thing&lt;/a&gt; is

the force of verses 32&amp;#8211;34, where Jesus tells his gathered&amp;nbsp;disciples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fear not, little flock, for it is your Father&amp;#8217;s good pleasure to give you the
kingdom. Sell your possessions, and give to the needy. Provide yourselves with
moneybags that do not grow old, with a treasure in the heavens that does not
fail, where no thief approaches and no moth destroys. For where your treasure
is, there will your heart be&amp;nbsp;also.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those words are compelling and troubling. &amp;#8220;Sell your possessions and give to the
needy.&amp;#8221; These are not difficult to understand. Nor, in truth, are they
particularly difficult to put into practice. The early church clearly saw that
they should behave this way, and did so: just look at Acts 2:44&amp;#8211;45, 4:32&amp;#8211;35.
This is not the pattern I see in the church around me today, for the most part.
Nor, more worrisome, is it exactly the pattern of my own&amp;nbsp;life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be sure, Jaimie and I have long since established habits of sacrificial
giving.&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; We aim to be generous with our things, not holding them tightly, as
well as with our time and our home. We have aimed to be hospitable, to open our
home to those who need space, and so on. But I am not sure that I would say we
are always characterized by this. I do not think we have ever sold one of our
things &lt;em&gt;in order&lt;/em&gt; to be willing to give it to someone in need. As I ponder, I
have no doubt that if one of our brothers or sisters in Christ were in great
need&amp;#8212;and especially one of those in our church&amp;#8212;we would be willing to do so.
But we have &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; done so, and so this passage forced me to think about a
Christ-following ethic regarding our&amp;nbsp;possessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am sitting here typing this on a very nice computer, in a very nice home, with
many niceties around me. I have no doubt that we could sell some of these things
in order to have money to give to others. I am left wondering: &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; we? It
does not seem to me to be possible always to be selling the things we have to
give them to others. Eventually one would simply run out of things to&amp;nbsp;sell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I note, too, that the context here shows us that Jesus is addressing a very
specific fault: worry about and pursuit of wealth. In this section he takes aim
at dependence on material possessions for security, pointing us to trust in God
instead of our things. He hammers away at the idea that we could somehow provide
for ourselves better than God does. We reminds us that all we have will be
destroyed in the end. He undercuts all our idolatry in this area. It would be
easy, then, to say that his words here are illustrative to that end, and not
really meaning quite what they seem to say. I think any such move would do the
text an injustice. Jesus said what he said, and we had better pay attention.
More: we had better&amp;nbsp;obey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not the having of things that is the problem, it seems to me. It is
clinging to them. It is seeing them as more important than people. The question
I pondered earlier is the important one: &lt;em&gt;Would Jaimie and I gladly part with
possessions to serve others who are in need?&lt;/em&gt; The answer to that is certainly
yes&amp;#8212;and indeed, we &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; parted generously with our money and our things in
the past. We have not &lt;em&gt;sold&lt;/em&gt; possessions to give the proceeds to others, but
have at times foregone purchases to give the money to others, and we have given
items themselves to others in need. We are moving in the right direction here.
Nonetheless, the heart check is an important one, and one to which we prosperous
Americans should return regularly. It is too easy for us to justify sitting in
our comfort without regard to the needs around us, and to fail thereby to obey
Jesus&amp;#8217; clear&amp;nbsp;commands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought about listing the ways we give, then thought better of it in
light of &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; of Jesus&amp;#8217; commands about how we should think about and act
about money.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

in our trespasses (1 Corinthians 15:17). This simple statement uncovers a great
deal about the necessity of Christ&amp;#8217;s resurrection as well as his death on our
behalf, as does much of the rest of the New Testament&amp;#8217;s view of the
resurrection. Paul tells us, for example, that Christ died for our trespasses
and was raised for our justification (Romans 4:25). Likewise, he notes Jesus&amp;#8217;
resurrection from the dead is intrinsically linked to our own life (e.g. Romans
8:11). Moreover, we know that if Jesus was not raised from the dead, then
neither will we be (1 Corinthians 15:16). We know that it was in the
resurrection that Jesus was shown to be the Son of God in power (Romans 1:4) and
thus the one who reigns over all things. Moreover, we note that the preaching of
the apostles as recorded in Acts refers to the resurrection of Christ as the
evidence that he is indeed the Jewish messiah and the judge of the earth&amp;#8212;
indeed, from Acts we see that the apostolic message &lt;em&gt;centered&lt;/em&gt; on the
resurrection of Christ. Likewise, the very shape of the gospels is such that
each in its own way climaxes not with Jesus&amp;#8217; death but with his resurrection, as
if to say that the central issue of our faith is not the death of Christ but his
being raised from the&amp;nbsp;dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we put together all these pieces, it becomes clear that the resurrection is
integral in our salvation. It is not merely the &amp;#8220;seal&amp;#8221; upon the work Jesus did
at the cross, the evidence that the cross accomplished what it needed to. It is
part and parcel of our salvation, in and of itself. It is true that the
resurrection does indeed ratify the elements of the saving work of Christ that
were accomplished on the cross, but this is not all that it does. It seems clear
from the evidence of the New Testament that the resurrection itself is
efficacious in saving&amp;nbsp;us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If our mortal bodies are corrupted by sin, as we know they are, and if the
penalty of sin is death, as we know it is, then something more than payment for
sin must happen. Payment for sin is necessary, and so Jesus&amp;#8217; substitutionary
atonement in death on the cross is essential to our salvation. However, there is
more that is essential to our salvation. Reconciliation between God and man
began in the Incarnation, as in Jesus the Son of God united humanity and deity
in perfect fellowship once again, and it was accomplished (though not yet
finished) in the resurrection as Jesus took up a restored body in which the
power of sin and death were finally broken: an image of what our bodies will be
in the age to&amp;nbsp;come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, we know that if we die as things were before the Resurrection, even
were our sins paid for, we remain mortal and would never rise again of our own
merits. In his resurrection, Jesus triumphed over death&amp;#8212;the last enemy&amp;#8212;and
we know that the same Spirit that raised him from the dead will raise us from
the dead. We know that Jesus&amp;#8217; resurrection is the means of our justification. He
paid for our sins in his atoning death, but he sets us right with God in his
triumphant new life. We know that his reign as the rightful heir of all things
was inaugurated in his resurrection, not in his&amp;nbsp;death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, essential as was his death for our salvation, the resurrection of
Christ is no less important in our being restored to life with&amp;nbsp;God.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chris Krycho</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2014 08:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:www.chriskrycho.com,2014-03-18:2014/the-resurrection-is-essential.html</guid><category>M.&amp;hairsp;Div.</category></item><item><title>Luke’s Hinge</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/lukes-hinge.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Luke structures his narrative in an interesting way. From his introduction and the beginning of Jesus&amp;#8217; ministry, he moves along through a fairly short section of material before he describes Jesus&amp;#8217; turn toward Jerusalem. Starting as early as chapter 9&amp;#8212;less than halfway through the book&amp;#8212;Jesus begins predicting his death and discussing his plans to go to Jerusalem. In the sequences that follow, Jesus experiences the transfiguration, begins outright attacking the Pharisees and lawyers, and grows increasingly impatient with the&amp;nbsp;crowds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even as many times as I have read these chapters, the force of them hit me anew today. Jesus remains the compassionate shepherd of the sheep, but with a startling suddenness he manifests his impatience with the people whom Paul would later describe by noting that &amp;#8220;not all Israel is Israel&amp;#8221; (see Romans 9:6ff.). The crowds who gathered around were not all true followers; the Pharisees and lawyers who knew best the word that spoke of him were those who most failed to understand&amp;nbsp;him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have long found Jesus&amp;#8217; post-Transfiguration response to the man seeking healing for his son puzzling. Ordinarily, Jesus had been quick to compassion toward people like this. Only a chapter earlier, he had been praising the faith of a woman who had touched him and been healed, and responding to the earnest pleas of a family for the healing of their daughter. But here, he&amp;nbsp;complains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O faithless and twisted generation, how long am I to be with you and bear with&amp;nbsp;you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; what we&amp;nbsp;expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Luke&amp;#8217;s narrative, there is a hinge in 9:21&amp;#8211;36. Here, Jesus first predicts his death, then tells his disciples that they must take up their cross daily and follow him, and then experiences the Transfiguration. Afterward, this new impatience, which comes bubbling out not only in this encounter but in woes against unrepentant cities and against the teachers and lawyers. It is not that his compassion ceases, but that his frustration shows up alongside&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The turn here highlighted several things for me. First, Jesus saw what I too easily miss, even in having read these passages so often. When he complains about bearing with a twisted and faithless generation, it is because that generation &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; twisted and faithless, even if to my eyes the difference is not immediately obvious. But the contrast &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be clear, and it becomes clearer given this broader setting for the various confrontations. Luke sets up this encounter with a man seeking healing for his demoniac son against the backdrop of a gathered crowd, and only a few verses after Jesus has said, &amp;#8220;The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised.&amp;#8221; He knew full well that the hearts of the crowd were not turned to him as the Messiah whom they should worship. They were people who wanted miracles and nothing more. The moment they were given the right opportunity, these same people could and would turn on him&amp;#8212;as they did. So when we see Jesus acting in ways that surprise us, it points us back to the ways that his divinity and humanity mingled. He knew their hearts, as he knew what they would be doing to him soon&amp;nbsp;enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also highlights the reality of how Jesus partakes in the same attitude toward faithless generations that we see in the Godhead throughout the Old Testament. So often, we separate the two Testaments functionally, even if we consciously affirm their unity. But the same compassion we see in Christ is present in every interaction of God with his people and with the nations throughout the Old Testament. The same bubbling impatience that turns eventually to woe and judgment in the Old Testament is on display here in Christ. He is the loving savior who was marking the path toward Calvary, and he is the righteous judge who pronounced woe on those who rejected&amp;nbsp;him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be easy to make the same mistake that the crowds did in those days: to celebrate Jesus for what he does for us, without worshipping him as the Son of God or kneeling to him as the Anointed King. Indeed, so often this is &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; what we do. We want to take the blessings of salvation, the help of the indwelling Holy Spirit, while continuing to go our own ways. We want to use God. Instead, we ought to humbly worship the one who calls us to leave behind everything to follow him and proclaim the kingdom (see Luke 9:57&amp;#8211;62). We ought to rejoice that our names are written in the book of life, come what trials may, and worship the Christ of God who is risen and seated at the right hand of&amp;nbsp;God.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chris Krycho</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2014 08:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:www.chriskrycho.com,2014-03-17:2014/lukes-hinge.html</guid><category>devotions</category></item><item><title>The Atonement, Leon Morris</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/the-atonement-leon-morris.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Leon Morris&amp;#8217; &lt;em&gt;The Atonement&lt;/em&gt; is, as near as I can tell, fairly well regarded.
Given the importance of the doctrine of the atonement to our faith, I had hoped
that the book would be a profitable read when I saw that it was assigned as
reading for one of my classes this semester. Unfortunately, the book fell far
short of my&amp;nbsp;hopes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problems with the book are manifold. To begin, Morris is simply not a very
good writer. Run-on sentences crop up regularly. He seems to be aiming for both
a friendly conversational tone and erudition. (Conversational and scholarly
writing are both fine; the combination fails miserably for nearly anyone but
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;G.K.&lt;/span&gt; Chesterton or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;C.S.&lt;/span&gt; Lewis. Take it from me: I should know.) Most
importantly, Morris&amp;#8217; chapters are essentially thesis-less, and the &amp;#8220;conclusions&amp;#8221; to
which he comes rarely follow from the material presented in the rest of the
chapter. The section on redemption was particularly egregious in this regard: he
turned from a long discussion of redemption practices in the ancient world to a
short summary focusing on the Christian view of sin in contrast to the modern
world&amp;#8217;s view of the human situation&amp;#8212;with no transition or connection between
the&amp;nbsp;two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of the two basic problems with the book, in fact. His chapters are
essentially aiming to do two different things. On the one hand, Morris is
clearly interested in laying out the historical and linguistic background of the
various ideas associated with the atonement (the sacrificial system, Passover,
redemption, etc.). On the other hand, he clearly wants to find points of
application to the Christian life. In each chapter, he spends most of his time
on the first, then makes a rushed switch to the second for the final pages of
the chapter. At no point is this transition well-written, and in no chapter does
the application follow closely from the points he made in the background
material. Even within the background material which dominates each chapter,
Morris wanders. It is as if he is not sure whether he wanted to provide an
informative overview of the context, to argue against various views others have
offered regarding that background,&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; or to make some sort of theological
argument. Thus, he bounces between each of these modes rather haphazardly,
sometimes even within a single&amp;nbsp;paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This emphasis on background also rather defeats the purpose of the book. If the
aim is to help people see and savor the glory of Christ&amp;#8217;s atoning work on their
behalf&amp;#8212;a noble and worthy goal&amp;#8212;then Morris simply did the wrong thing. He
spends most of his time in the book on word studies, historical context, and so
on. When he does get to his &amp;#8220;application&amp;#8221; sections,&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; he usually has said very
little about Scripture&amp;#8217;s teaching on the atonement. Telling people what words
mean, or explaining the rabbis&amp;#8217; records of Second Temple Judaism practice, is
not the same as explaining the Scriptures. The book reads like a sermon series
from the historical-grammatical school where the background has been mistaken
for the content instead of as a helpful tool where the content is not clear.&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
Morris wastes his readers&amp;#8217; time with secondary matters and speeds over the
riches of the text&amp;nbsp;itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Morris &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; pay attention to the actual content of Scripture rather than
its background, he tends to dwell on his hobby-horses instead of letting
Scripture speak for itself. He often writes things like, &amp;#8220;Of course, Scripture
&lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; include (one idea), but really we should take it (in some other way).&amp;#8221;&amp;#8212;
where the latter is his preferred reading, and the former the way the text
actually reads. Unsurprisingly, then, the best chapters in the book are those
where his hobby-horses are nearest the actual point of the text in question. In
the final three chapters of the book, he veers away into secondary matters much
less and focuses on the text much more. It made for a significant&amp;nbsp;improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alas, even this improvement did nothing to help resolve the other significant
problem with the book. In short, Morris&amp;#8217; approach to New Testament doctrine is
hopelessly reductionistic. Everything comes down to the idea of payment for the
guilt of sin, even in chapters where he tries to talk about other things. Morris
set out to write a book on the atonement, and instead of spending his time
tracing out the atonement itself, he tried to make every other aspect of our
salvation a part of the atonement. The book might have worked had it been titled
&lt;em&gt;Salvation&lt;/em&gt;, but in seeking to make every part of God&amp;#8217;s saving work into a mere
aspect of atonement, Morris both diminished those other parts and failed to
spend much time discussing the atonement&amp;nbsp;itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this Morris is very much typical of evangelicalism, sad to say. We are a
crucicentric people, and though this has its upsides, it also means we tend to
rewrite all of our doctrines in terms of penal subtitutionary atonement, rather
than letting them all work together as they do in the Bible. Atonement is one
central and crucial (pun intended) part of our salvation, but it is not the
whole of our&amp;nbsp;salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morris&amp;#8217; book could have been a helpful volume; a robust doctrine of the
atonement is a wonderful thing. I am sad to say that &lt;em&gt;The Atonement&lt;/em&gt; simply
wasn&amp;#8217;t very good. There are helpful bits scattered throughout, but to find them
one must wade through a great deal of poorly written, unnecessarily polemical,
disorganized, distracted meandering about things that are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the atonement
(though they are themselves wonderful). I cannot recommend&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Including, unfortunately, the occasional joke about the Church Fathers&amp;#8217;
views on aspects of the atonement are. At one point, he goes so far as to
describe the Fathers&amp;#8217; &amp;#8220;ransom view&amp;#8221; of the atonement as silly and only worth
laughing at. We might &lt;em&gt;disagree&lt;/em&gt; with the Fathers&amp;#8217; ransom view of the atonement,
with God paying Satan&amp;#8212;I do&amp;#8212;but we hardly ought to laugh at them. This is
chronological snobbery of the worst sort.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually focusing on the shape of the Christian life&amp;#8212;an odd choice in a
book one would think would focus on the gospel itself. To be sure, I think that
the atonement has enormous implications for the Christian life. Morris never
shows &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; they connect, though, and he doesn&amp;#8217;t spend any time talking about
the marvel of the atonement itself for the Christian, either. It is just
strange.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the way that the historical-grammatical approach normally goes
wrong. Other approaches have their own typical foibles, of course.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems inevitable that our country will try to combat generational poverty
and all its great harms by investing heavily in early childhood intervention.
We already see signs of the State moving towards such programs with President
Obama’s 2013 State of the Union address and Mayor de Blasio’s expanded pre-K.
Tragically and despite enormous costs, de Blasio’s pre-K initiative in New
York will most likely have very modest results, particularly since it begins
intervention at age four, so late in the child’s mental development. The
question for the church is, will we allow the state to take the initiative, or
will we take up this task and engender the kind of deep, redemptive healing
that the state can only dream&amp;nbsp;of?&lt;/p&gt;

Testament for Christians. The language applied to him in Isaiah 53 in particular
has long been understood by Christians to point directly to Jesus as the atoning
savior. The role of the Servant in the book is somewhat more complex than a
simple prediction of Jesus as subtitutionary atonement however: it encompasses
that idea, but does much more as&amp;nbsp;well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The label of Servant is applied to two (or possibly three) different roles in
Isaiah: the nation of Israel, and one who suffers and works on behalf of Israel.
This latter role certainly contains messianic overtures, but may also include
poetic references to Isaiah&amp;#8217;s own suffering on behalf&amp;nbsp;Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theme of the Servant first appears in chapter 40, and is immediately and
directly applied in reference to Israel/Jacob. The same is true of its
appearance in chapters 41 and 43, though the language used of the servant in
chapter 42 suggests an individual and not the nation, and should perhaps be
taken as pointing to a king who represents the nation given the national
context. Beginning in chapter 45 and moving forward, the Servant increasingly
appears as the individual who acts for Israel on Yahweh&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;behalf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether the Servant-Israel or the Servant-for-Israel (as we might label them),
the Servant exists to be God&amp;#8217;s agent in bringing about the obedience of the
nations. The Servant-Israel experiences cleansing and purification to that end,
while the Servant-for-Israel experiences suffering in place of Israel, for her
sins and to save her from her unrighteous ways.&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In both cases, the suffering
is part of God&amp;#8217;s plan to lead the nations out of their idolatry to participate
in his covenant with Israel. The shape of the role taken by the Servant differs,
though, and as the book progresses the need for the Servant-for-Israel becomes
more and more clear, because the Servant-Israel is simply not up to the task (as
was made clear by the first 39 chapters of the&amp;nbsp;book!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the Servant-for-Israel acts on behalf of Israel in the latter parts of
chapters 40&amp;#8211;55. He picks up kingly responsibilities of doing justice and
righteousness in the earth (a theme Isaiah seems to take up from the Psalms and
elaborate). He stands as Israel&amp;#8217;s representative in dealing with her sin. He
brings the nations in to participate in Israel&amp;#8217;s covenant life with God. In some
sense, the messianic king figure becomes True Israel on Israel&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;behalf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transition between Servant-Israel and Servant-for-Israel not only picks up
messianic overtones, but also hints at autobiographical elements for Isaiah
himself. Lest Christian readers be skittish at this notion, wanting to preserve
the text&amp;#8217;s unique way of pointing to Jesus: it is hardly uncommon for figures in
the Old Testament to prefigure the messiah in various ways. Here it is Jesus&amp;#8217;
role as Prophet we see prefigured, just asthe entire Levitical system prefigured
him as Priest and David prefigured him as King. Isaiah&amp;#8217;s suffering on behalf of
Israel is a clear parallel to Jesus&amp;#8217; ministry, and Jesus himself makes this
clear in his teaching in the New Testament, where he emphasizes that he came in
part to close eyes and ears as well as open&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result of the progression is that the reader moves from seeing Israel as
God&amp;#8217;s servant to recognizing the need for a servant who will work as God&amp;#8217;s agent
on Israel&amp;#8217;s behalf, to seeing that even Isaiah was an incomplete picture of this
servant. The one of whom Isaiah prophesied would be not only Prophet but also
king and both priest and sacrifice on behalf of the people. He would not only
speak of the nations coming to participate in fellowship with God in the Zion of
Israel, he would bring it about&amp;nbsp;himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notably, the redemption pictured in Isaiah goes beyond subtitution for
sins, and includes restoration to a holy nature&amp;#8212;a theme that is picked up
clearly in the New Testament but too often overlooked by modern readers.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

expounding its virtues and necessity and contrasting them with the costs of
folly, before moving into the proverbs for which it is named. After a short
introductory statement, the book moves into a series of extended metaphors for
wisdom and folly to illustrate the point. These metaphors are those of the two
women, the two houses, and the two ways&amp;#8212;with the choices between the two
illustrated in each case by the simple youth who may choose one or the other and
become either wise or a&amp;nbsp;fool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two women of the book are the Ladies Wisdom and Folly. Throughout the first
nine chapters, the two stand in opposition to each other everywhere. Wisdom
calls out on the streets, by the gates, and in the highest point of the city.
She represents the first aspect of God&amp;#8217;s order in the world, that foundational
principle on which the world is built. She is an attribute of the creation God
made and a reflection of his desires and character. By contrast, the adulteress
(or &amp;#8220;foreign woman&amp;#8221;) who leads astray a simple youth and destroys him in chapter
7 is a picture not only of the particular follies of adultery but a
personification of all that is foolish: wherever wisdom stands and calls out, so
too does the adulteress&amp;#8212;Lady Folly in one of her most deceptive forms. She is
an image of what it means to go against the grain of God&amp;#8217;s created order, and
the consequence of going with her is death. No surprise, that: going against the
structure of God&amp;#8217;s reality has &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; led to death, beginning in Genesis&amp;nbsp;3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two ways and two houses pick up this same motif and trace it out further.
One way leads to life, the other to death. One house is steadfast and sure,
while the other crumbles. One belongs to Wisdom, the other to Folly. These
images Jesus picks up again in his own teaaching in the New Testament: The way
that leads to life is narrow, and few find it, but the way that leads to
destruction is wide and many walk it. The wise man builds his house on the rock
that is Jesus&amp;#8217; word, but the foolish man builds his house on the sand that is
worldly wisdom. The naïve youth may answer Lady Wisdom&amp;#8217;s invitation and follow
her along the way of wisdom to the house of wisdom and so become wise, or he may
answer Lady Folly&amp;#8217;s call, walk down folly&amp;#8217;s road to the house of destruction and
so become a&amp;nbsp;fool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of the &amp;#8220;wise person&amp;#8221; and the &amp;#8220;fool&amp;#8221; then come up time and again
throughout the rest of the book. Whatever one decides has the enormous
consequences that the book traces out: fools become insolent, ignorant,
murderous rebels against God, while wise people become gracious, temperate,
gentle followers of&amp;nbsp;God.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chris Krycho</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2014 15:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:www.chriskrycho.com,2014-03-11:2014/wisdom-and-folly.html</guid><category>M.&amp;hairsp;Div.</category></item><item><title>Job—The Mourner</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/job-the-mourner.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;The book of Job has most commonly been read as theodicy, i.e. as a defense of
God&amp;#8217;s goodness in the face of human suffering and the existence of evil in the
world. This reading has a number of difficulties, not least in that though the
characters in the book raise this question, neither God in his appearance nor
the narrator offer an answer to it. Indeed, the final shape of the book is such
that the reader has some understanding of why &lt;em&gt;Job&lt;/em&gt; suffered as he did&amp;#8212;but
only some. God&amp;#8217;s reasons for acting in the particular ways he did remain hidden,
and (more importantly) the answers we see in Job&amp;#8217;s specific case are clearly not
applicable to every case of human&amp;nbsp;suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One possible way out of this problem is to approach the text from a different
angle. Supposing that Job was not written as a theodicy, but as an exploration
of an entirely different need, how might we read the book more profitably? One
suggestion is that the central issue in the text is how Job might move from a
position of ritual mourning back into a position of ritual life&amp;#8212;and this
approach does indeed yield significant exegetical&amp;nbsp;fruit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of Job&amp;#8217;s troubles experienced in the first two chapters of the book
warranted his entering a state of ritual mourning: he experienced calamity in
the loss of his possessions, the death of his sons and daughters, and the onset
of a skin disease. The Levitical law proscribed the kinds of mourning an
Israelite would undergo under each of these circumstances, and none were
trivial. Though Job as a non-Israelite would not have lived under the Levitical
law, he &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; live in a culture that embraced that pattern of ritual mourning in
response to these problems, and the Israelite audience would have recognized his
behavior as such. Thus, in Job 1&amp;#8211;2, we see Job respond to his great calamity by
tearing his clothes, going out of the town and sitting on the trash heap, and
scraping his skin with a shard of pottery. These were not merely expressions of
his grief (though, to be sure, he was grieved) but symbolic statements that he
had entered a state of ritual death in a period of&amp;nbsp;mourning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Job now needed a way to move back to ritual life, the ordinary state of affairs.
Culturally, &amp;#8220;comforters&amp;#8221; were the means afforded him for this end, and this
explains the efforts of Eliphaz, Bildad, Zophar, and (eventually) Elihu. Each in
his way sought to help Job come to terms with his loss, become right with God,
and return to ordinary life. Since the three each embraced both the so-called
&amp;#8220;retribution principle&amp;#8221; and its corollary&amp;#8212;that God rewards the righteous and
punishes the wicked, and that accordingly prosperity and suffering are
indicators of righteousness and wickedness respectively&amp;#8212;they all tried to
convince Job that he ought to repent of his apparent&amp;nbsp;sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notably, however, none could persuade Job of any sin warranting such suffering
as he endured, and moreover the book agrees with Job: the narrative prologue
first chapters tells us that Job was &amp;#8220;blameless and upright&amp;#8221; and that &amp;#8220;in all
this [his initial response to loss] he did not sin.&amp;#8221; Job&amp;#8217;s bitter response
midway through the book (&amp;#8220;Miserable comforters are you all!&amp;#8221;) makes perfect
sense in this context: they were not relieving him of his state of ritual death,
for their words offered no way forward. Thus, Job increasingly turns away from
answering his friends to pleading with God to appear and answer him, though as
Job acknowledges, no one can contend with God. Still: even against the largely
accurate answers Elihu provides in chapters 32&amp;#8211;36, Job was unmoved. He needed
something&amp;nbsp;else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When God appears, he does not answer Job&amp;#8217;s questions, but neither does he accuse
him of sin. Rather, he shows Job his wisdom, and how greatly his wisdom exceeds
Job&amp;#8217;s understanding. This, it seems, &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; what Job needed in order to move from
mourning back to life. He is able to say, &amp;#8220;Before, I had heard of you, but now
my eyes have seen you,&amp;#8221; and &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; is what triggers his return to normal life at
the end of the book. Moreover, his statement of repentance in Job 42 makes a
great deal more sense this way: he now turned away (&amp;#8220;repented&amp;#8221; in the bare
sense) &lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt; dust and ashes&amp;#8212;not repenting of some unnamed sin &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; dust and
ashes. Indeed, this (the common reading) would hardly make sense, given that Job
immediately puts off his dust and ashes and returns to his life. Job was able to
move from ritual death to ritual life because he had encountered God. As a
result, Job did return to all the ordinary parts of life. Whereas the mourner
was forbidden from feasting, worshipping, and sexual activity, Job participates
in all three in the conclusion of the book. His friends and family come and eat
with him. He offers sacrifice for his friends. He fathers more&amp;nbsp;children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, taking Job in light of ancient near eastern mourning ritual helps us
understand the book&amp;#8217;s message and structure far more clearly than taking it as a
theodicy. The text does not seek to answer why God allows evil. Indeed, it
inverts the question: who are we to think we could understand? In Job we have
instead a recognition that the only thing that will really satisfy the soul of
one experiencing the deep suffering that life brings is an encounter with the
living God. The only thing that could move Job from ritual death to ritual life
is the only thing that can move us from spiritual death to spiritual life&amp;#8212;not
mere academic knowledge of facts about God, but encountering him as one who may
be&amp;nbsp;known.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chris Krycho</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2014 14:30:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:www.chriskrycho.com,2014-03-11:2014/job-the-mourner.html</guid><category>M.&amp;hairsp;Div.</category></item><item><title>North Korea Set to Execute 33 Christians</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/north-korea-set-to-execute-33-christians.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;The Washington Times&amp;nbsp;reports:&lt;/p&gt;

year is that it covers a lot of ground. Besides reading all of the historical
books last semester for my Old Testament I survey class and all of the wisdom
literature and prophets this semester for my Old Testament &lt;span class="caps"&gt;II&lt;/span&gt; survey class, I
am also reading through the Psalms and the Proverbs regularly (I expect to
cover the Psalms twice and the Proverbs at least ten times this year), and
going over various parts of the New Testament as well. Among other things, this
really helps me see the bigger picture and integrate my readings more&amp;nbsp;effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, I am increasingly convinced that many evangelicals need not more of the
detailed word studies of which we are so fond,&lt;sup id="fnref:word-studies"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:word-studies" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; but a broader
understanding of the ways that the various books and parts of books fit into
their canonical and salvation-historical contexts. We need to understand the
epistle to Titus, for example, not just as a series of instructions for polity
disconnected from salvation history (apart from the parts where Paul refers to
salvation history) but as an integral part of that history. The same is true of
books we often find difficult to integrate into such a reading, especially the
wisdom literature but even including the&amp;nbsp;Psalms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; Paul&amp;#8217;s letter to Titus fit into the rest of the canon, and into
salvation history? We have of course one of Paul&amp;#8217;s typically succinct and
incisive summaries of the&amp;nbsp;gospel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when the goodness and loving kindness of God our Savior appeared, he saved
us, not because of works done by us in righteousness, but according to his own
mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit, whom he
poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior, so that being
justified by his grace we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal
life. (Titus 3:4-7, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESV&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even beyond this explicit pointer to salvation history, though, we must
recognize that the book sits in the canon as it does for a reason. We are meant
to learn from the needs of the early church, and to remember that the work of
God did not stop with the ascension of Christ, nor even with the apostles. We
are meant to come away both understanding how we ought to do things ourselves in
our own churches better and understanding what God is about in the church more
clearly. Paul gets at this quite explicitly, albeit briefly, along the&amp;nbsp;way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation for all people, training
us to renounce ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled,
upright, and godly lives in the present age, waiting for our blessed hope, the
appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ, who gave
himself for us to redeem us from all lawlessness and to purify for himself a
people for his own possession who are zealous for good works. (Titus 2:11-14,
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESV&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The church exists not only as a lifeboat for those drowning in their sins
(though of course it is that), but as a distinctive, united group of people
called together to live in a specific way. We are called to live in a particular
way, to be a peculiar people: self-controlled, upright, and godly. Jesus gave
himself for us&lt;sup id="fnref:gave"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:gave" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; not only to pay for our sins, but to make something new of
us. He redeemed us from lawlessness; no more should we walk in our own ways. He
purified us for himself as a people&amp;#8212;not merely a disparate group of persons,
but as a united people who are characterized above all by belonging to him.
Moreover, as a people we are to be &lt;em&gt;zealous&lt;/em&gt; for good works. As I wrote
&lt;a href="/2014/work-hard.html"&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, this is a view we could use a great deal
more&amp;nbsp;of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to see clearly our own place in salvation history. We are not people
saved in the abstract, or saved as lone-standing individuals, or so that we may
have license to do whatever we like. We have been saved with an end in mind:
that we might do good and so make much of Christ in the world around us. The
result, as Paul points out elsewhere in the book, will be that people will have
no cause to revile us and may be led to repentance. In short, we are part of
God&amp;#8217;s work in history, and our Spirit-empowered pursuit of corporate and
personal holiness and good works in the world we inhabit is an important,
meaningful part of that work in&amp;nbsp;history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:word-studies"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I might also point out that, from a linguistics perspective,
the idea of &amp;#8220;word studies&amp;#8221; is fundamentally broken. Think about all the ways
that the word &amp;#8220;conceive&amp;#8221; is used, for example&amp;#8212;it would be a fallacy to think
that every time we use the word in its cognitive sense, we mean to include all
the connotations of a child coming into a being. We inevitably indulge in many
such fallacies in our usual approach to word studies, and the amount of
technical language skill needed to avoid such things is high. I usually
recommend that people simply not do word studies at all for this reason
alone&amp;#8212;but there are other good reasons, too, not least that such studies tend
to distract us from the point being made in a particular place as we try to see
what the words mean in all the &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; places. That, too, misunderstands how
language works.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:word-studies" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:gave"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find it telling that Paul says Jesus &lt;em&gt;gave&lt;/em&gt; himself for us rather
than only that he &lt;em&gt;died&lt;/em&gt; for us. We know from Philippians that the Son gave to
us in the act of the Incarnation as well as in his death.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:gave" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

Christians. As soon as he has finished his theological foundation in Romans&amp;#8212;
the most lengthy of any such argument he makes in any of his letters&amp;#8212;he moves
immediately into some remarkably profound exhortations. They are worth quoting
at length and pondering at&amp;nbsp;length:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let love be genuine. Abhor what is evil; hold fast to what is good. Love one
another with brotherly affection. Outdo one another in showing honor. Do not
be slothful in zeal, be fervent in spirit, serve the Lord. Rejoice in hope, be
patient in tribulation, be constant in prayer. Contribute to the needs of the
saints and seek to show&amp;nbsp;hospitality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse them. Rejoice with those
who rejoice, weep with those who weep. Live in harmony with one another. Do
not be haughty, but associate with the lowly. Never be wise in your own sight.
Repay no one evil for evil, but give thought to do what is honorable in the
sight of all. If possible, so far as it depends on you, live peaceably with
all. Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave it to the wrath of God, for
it is written, &amp;#8220;Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord.&amp;#8221; To the
contrary, &amp;#8220;if your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him
something to drink; for by so doing you will heap burning coals on his head.&amp;#8221;
Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good. (Romans&amp;nbsp;12:9&amp;#8211;21)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This list of exhortations is stunning in its breadth and depth. It is impossibly
difficult. We could easily become discouraged, and recognizing our own hypocrisy
despair and give up,&lt;sup id="fnref:despair"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:despair" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; but this was clearly not Paul&amp;#8217;s intent. Rather,
he was setting before his audience&amp;#8212;and thus, before us&amp;#8212;a picture of the true
Christian life and calling us to pursue it. He was no fool; he had spent much of
the book discussing the very challenges that face every would-be follower of God
and knew well the weakness of our own flesh. Moreover, immediately after this
list, he turned from these instructions to deal with the kinds of weaknesses
that have come up in every congregation from his day to&amp;nbsp;ours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul knew we would fail at this list, yet he gave it to us anyway. The authors
of the New Testament do not shy away from this move. Jesus told us flatly that
we must be perfect as our heavenly father is perfect, and the apostles picked up
this theme and ran with it. Why in the world would they do this, knowing we
would never meet such a standard (most of all our Lord, who alone has lived
righteously)? Is this merely more Law designed to point us back to the Gospel
and show us that even as believers, we can do nothing, or are these real
instructions&amp;#8212;and if the latter, how are we to respond without being crushed by
our&amp;nbsp;inability?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the latter: a geniuine call to a righteous life. The idea that
these kinds of instructions exist &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; to point us back to the gospel does not
do justice to the text, and in fact leads us fairly quickly to a quiet
antinominianism. Where we think that we are unable to fulfill God&amp;#8217;s law and that
even aiming to do so is somehow wrong, we quickly stop pursuing real holiness.
This cannot be&amp;nbsp;right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the problem remains: even for the faithful Christian who &lt;em&gt;wants&lt;/em&gt; to
fulfill these commands, we recognize our failure. Here, the gospel &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the
answer&amp;#8212;just not in the way so many antinomian-tending believers take it. The
gospel reminds us first of what Christ Jesus has done on our behalf and removes
the weight of thinking that we must meet these standards to stand before a
righteous God. We never could. We can stand before him only because we are
clothed with the righteousness of the Incarnate Son of God who clothed himself
in all our sins and bore every drop of the Godhead&amp;#8217;s wrath on our sin already.
Second, the gospel reminds us that we are &lt;em&gt;presently&lt;/em&gt; united with Christ by the
indwelling of his Spirit. The Spirit that raised Christ from the dead&amp;#8212;the
third person of the Trinity who empowered Jesus to perform his earthly ministry
without sinning&amp;#8212;lives in us. It is God who works in us both to will and work
for his good pleasure. Third, we remember that we have an advocate before the
throne of the Father who is always interceding for us, and that the Spirit prays
for us when we do not know how to pray for ourselves.&lt;sup id="fnref:trinity"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:trinity" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; We have not been
left&amp;nbsp;alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we look at the gospel over and over again, and in so doing are empowered to
press on when we do not love perfectly, when we are wise in our sight, when we
fail to do what we ought and when we do what we ought not to do. We remember
what Christ has done, how he stands now before the Father on our behalf, and how
we will stand righteous in him come the final day.&lt;sup id="fnref:first"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:first" rel="footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; We remember how the
Spirit indwells us and empowers us just as he did Christ. We remember that we
&lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; been raised with Christ even as we &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; be raised with Christ. And we
can press on. We can work hard, knowing God is at work in&amp;nbsp;us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:despair"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was talking with an acquaintance recently who took precisely this
course. It broke my heart. We need not despair.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:despair" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:trinity"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not miss this! All Christians have two members of the Trinity
always speaking to the third on our behalf, and the third is delighting to
respond!&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:trinity" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:first"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A small point of wonder: the final day will also be the &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt; day in
many ways. It will be the end of this age, and the beginning of an age without
sorrow or tears or calamity. Hallelujah.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:first" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a recent study by Ookla Speedtest, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; ranks a shocking 31st
in the world in terms of average download speeds. The leaders in the world are

Word for word, I am
hard pressed to think of any other document with such depths. Not for nothing
has it often been called the greatest letter ever written. Paul&amp;#8217;s incredible
intellect is on full display throughout the letter, dedicated entirely to one
end: that his readers would see and delight in the work of God in Jesus, the
Jewish Messiah through whom salvation came to all&amp;nbsp;nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read Romans 4&amp;#8211;6 tonight, and I hardly know where to begin in responding to
all the truths layered throughout these chapters. Paul spends most of these
first chapters dwelling on the doctrine of justification. &lt;em&gt;How,&lt;/em&gt; he asks, &lt;em&gt;can
unrighteous people stand before a holy God? And how can a holy God let them?&lt;/em&gt;
These are not new questions for the Scriptures&amp;#8212;they are, in some sense, some
of the &lt;em&gt;oldest&lt;/em&gt;. From the moment that Adam and Eve disobeyed God and ate of the
fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and in so doing sundered
themselves from their maker, God has been showing mercy and restraint toward we
people who are ever in rebellion against him. He made a way for often-failing
Israel to nonetheless be in a covenant relationship with him throughout the Old
Testament years, and he laid out the pattern: blood for blood, life for life,
every sin requiring payment. Yet the blood of bulls and goats was not exactly a
perfect substitute for a human being. God passed over sins because he was
merciful and kind and longsuffering&amp;#8212;but he is also just, and justice must be&amp;nbsp;done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is with all this as a(n often-referenced) backdrop that Paul lays out his
doctrine of justification. Having shown in chapter 3 that Jesus is the answer to
the problem of sinful people standing before a righteous God, Paul arcs out and
back again over and over again through these chapters to the glorious reality
that in Christ, we stand perfectly justified before God. God counts us righteous
because Christ was righteous on our behalf, died on our behalf, and was raised
on our behalf.&lt;sup id="fnref:raised"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:raised" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul goes out to Abraham&amp;#8217;s justification by faith in God, hammering away at any
notion that Abraham was justified by his circumcision or any other good deed and
pointing instead to his trust in God, born out by obedience. Then he arcs back
in to look at Jesus&amp;#8217; death and resurrection and our response of faith. Then he
zooms back out again to the history of salvation in Adam&amp;#8217;s trespass and back in
to Christ&amp;#8217;s work to redeem humanity in every way that it was cursed in Adam. In
chapter 6, he applies these truths at a doctrinal level: justification is not
license to sin, but grounds for and the basis of empowerment to obey. Paul
returns to this theme at length in the end of the book, but he wants it made
clear here: the death and resurrection of Christ do not give us cause to embrace
antinomianism, but instead lead us to the obedience of faith, just as it did in
Abraham.&lt;sup id="fnref:obey"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:obey" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this discussion of what Paul says&amp;#8212;good though it is&amp;#8212;can mask the beauty
and the magnificence of his proclamations, though. As John Piper has commented:
the God revealed in these pages is worthy of more than mere intellectual
analysis. He must be proclaimed, and Paul is proclaiming&amp;nbsp;him&amp;#8212;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romans&amp;nbsp;4:24&amp;#8211;25:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be counted to us who believe in him who raised from
the dead Jesus our Lord, who was delivered up for our trespasses and raised
for our&amp;nbsp;justification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romans&amp;nbsp;5:6&amp;#8211;11:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For while we were still weak, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly.
For one will scarcely die for a righteous person—though perhaps for a good
person one would dare even to die—but God shows his love for us in that while
we were still sinners, Christ died for us. Since, therefore, we have now been
justified by his blood, much more shall we be saved by him from the wrath of
God. For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of
his Son, much more, now that we are reconciled, shall we be saved by his life.
More than that, we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through
whom we have now received&amp;nbsp;reconciliation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romans&amp;nbsp;6:5&amp;#8211;11:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we shall certainly be
united with him in a resurrection like his. We know that our old self was
crucified with him in order that the body of sin might be brought to nothing,
so that we would no longer be enslaved to sin. For one who has died has been
set free from sin. Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we will
also live with him. We know that Christ, being raised from the dead, will
never die again; death no longer has dominion over him. For the death he died
he died to sin, once for all, but the life he lives he lives to God. So you
also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ&amp;nbsp;Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christ is risen from the dead! He has trampled down sin and death. He has made
atonement for us. He has been born and lived and died a man, tempted like us in
every respect yet without sin, but dying he did not stay dead! He has been
declared the Son of God with power (Romans 1:4) and raised from the dead to
show the surety of our faith and our hope.&amp;nbsp;Hallelujah!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:raised"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romans 4:25 is one of those verses that surprises we crucicentric
evangelicals: it says that Jesus was delivered up (i.e. to the cross) for our
trespasses and &lt;em&gt;raised&lt;/em&gt; for our justification. We have no justification before
God apart from Jesus&amp;#8217; resurrection from the dead. Indeed, the resurrection of
Christ is woven through Romans as one of the central themes, too often
overlooked by evangelicals, from the very introduction of the book (cf. Romans
1:4).&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:raised" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:obey"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This theme of obedience also runs throughout the book. Again,
evangelicals can be quick to point to the idea that we are saved by faith,
apart from any work of the law, and given the rest of the book of Romans, this
is a truth we heartily embrace, and in which we should rejoice. But the faith
in view, as James reminds us in his epistle, is not a sort of abstract,
intellectual affirmation or an emotional rush of good feeling toward God. It is
belief that produces obedience; if it does not produce obedience, &lt;em&gt;it is not
real faith and we remain unjustified&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:obey" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chris Krycho</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 05 Mar 2014 23:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:www.chriskrycho.com,2014-03-05:2014/salvation-is-beautiful.html</guid><category>devotions</category></item><item><title>What He Did Not Assume</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/what-he-did-not-assume.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;There have been many broken and flawed Christologies over the years, and in
truth many of them continue to crop up in mainstream evangelicalism. Nearly
every major heresy the church confronts (and no few of its littler skirmishes)
revolve around issues of the nature of the Incarnate Son of God. From the
earliest days of the church, there has been a tension between those emphasizing
Jesus&amp;#8217; humanity at the cost of his deity and those emphasizing his deity at the
cost of his humanity. The clear testimony of Scripture, however, is that Jesus
was everything that it is to be God and also everything that it is to be&amp;nbsp;human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we say, then, that in the Incarnation the Son of God &amp;#8216;took his flesh from
Mary&amp;#8217;, we are emphasizing that he inherited from her all that it means to be a
human being. Nothing was missing or absent. The Word who was from the
beginning, and through whom the Father created the world, and indeed for whom
the world exists, took upon himself human body and&amp;nbsp;soul/mind/spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He participated fully in all the weaknesses of human existence. He became
subject to common colds and the need to expel waste from his body. He
experienced teething pains, and he needed to eat and sleep. He experienced real
temptation to sin, more fully than has any other human because he resisted it
to the last. He bore the sorrows of life in a world filled with suffering and
war and death. He was in everything the word means &lt;em&gt;human&lt;/em&gt;. As the author of
Hebrews puts&amp;nbsp;it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since therefore the children share in flesh and blood, he himself likewise
partook of the same things, that through death he might destroy the one who
has the power of death, that is, the devil, and deliver all those who through
fear of death were subject to lifelong slavery. For surely it is not angels
that he helps, but he helps the offspring of Abraham. Therefore he had to be
made like his brothers in every respect, so that he might become a merciful
and faithful high priest in the service of God, to make propitiation for the
sins of the people. For because he himself has suffered when tempted, he is
able to help those who are being tempted. (Hebrews&amp;nbsp;2:14&amp;#8211;18)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We share in flesh and blood; he shared in flesh and blood. He became like us in
every respect&amp;#8212;not partially, not in some respects, but in every respect. He
suffered when he was tempted; the lures and draws of the world did not simply
pass by him without any challenge whatsoever. He took from Mary &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;
about&amp;nbsp;humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This matters because, as the Fathers pointed out, what he has not assumed has
not been redeemed. Redemption is more than (though of course not less than)
propitiation for sins. It is the re-uniting of humanity with God, so that all
the myriad ways in which human nature has been broken may be set once again how
it ought to be. It is the restoration of &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the things that were broken in
humanity by the Fall. There is no part of humanity that was not broken by the
Fall, no part that does not need restoration, no part that was not cut off from
fellowship with God. Thus, there is no part of humanity that is not in need of
redemption, and so anything the Son did not take up of our humanity when he
became Jesus the Christ is still&amp;nbsp;broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Jesus had only the mind of God and not a human mind, then our minds are still
unredeemed. If Jesus&amp;#8217; body was not the Son&amp;#8217;s body but a drone-like extension of
his will, then our minds remain unredeemed. If Jesus&amp;#8217; will was not a human will
but purely and only a divine will, then our wills remain unredeemed. In each
case, if Jesus was not both God and man in his nature, we are lost. In this
sense, then, few things are of more theological import than the nature of the
incarnation. The cross and resurrection, powerful though they are, do not have
their intended effect of redeeming lost women and men unless the Incarnation was
the complete joining of God and man in Jesus. And so: praise be to God! For when
Jesus took his flesh from Mary, he took up humanity whole and entire, leaving
nothing out, and joined it with his deity whole and entire, leaving nothing out.
So now we through him participated in the divine nature (2 Peter 1:4), just as
he participated in human&amp;nbsp;nature.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chris Krycho</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 05 Mar 2014 15:30:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:www.chriskrycho.com,2014-03-05:2014/what-he-did-not-assume.html</guid><category>M.&amp;hairsp;Div.</category></item><item><title>Adam’s Sin and Our Death</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/adams-sin-and-our-death.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;How exactly human beings&amp;#8217; guilt relates to Adam&amp;#8217;s guilt is a question of no
small theological import, and it has unsurprisingly been the topic of much
theological discussion&amp;#8212;not to say debate&amp;#8212;over the past many hundreds of
years. The central passage is Romans&amp;nbsp;5:12&amp;#8211;14:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, and death through
sin, and so death spread to all men because all sinned&amp;#8212;for sin indeed was in
the world before the law was given, but sin is not counted where there is no
law. Yet death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those whose sinning was
not like the transgression of Adam, who was a type of the one who was to&amp;nbsp;come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic historic, orthodox&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; views of this position may be summarized as&amp;nbsp;follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All humans are guilty of Adam&amp;#8217;s sin because they were in his loins when he
  sinned, and so have not only been contaminated with his sinful nature but also
  actively sinned when he sinned, and so are guilty and under judgment of death
  from their very conception&amp;#8212;a position most famously and forcefully
  articulated by&amp;nbsp;Augustine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All humans are born guilty of Adam&amp;#8217;s sin because he acted as the federal head
  of the human race and so we are imputed guilty in him, just as when we
  partipate in the humanity of the new federal head of humanity&amp;#8212;Jesus
  Christ&amp;#8212;his righteousness is imputed to us. In this view, humans are born
  subject to the punishment of sin (including death) because all of us are
  &lt;em&gt;counted&lt;/em&gt; guilty in Adam, just as we experience the blessings of holiness
  when in Christ because we are &lt;em&gt;counted&lt;/em&gt; righteous in him (the historic
  Reformed&amp;nbsp;view).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All humans are born innocent of Adam&amp;#8217;s guilt, but by dint of descent from him
  have the same corrupted sinful nature he did, and therefore all &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; sin and
  incur guilt before a holy God. Furthermore, as Adam&amp;#8217;s descendants, all are
  born separated from God and therefore mortal. In this view, humans are born
  innocent of guilt but inevitably sin because of their fallen humanity and die
  because of their separation from God. This is the view articulated by the
  Baptist Faith and Message&amp;nbsp;2000.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most basic logic of the passage seems to run most closely in line with this
last articulation. Paul argues that &amp;#8220;sin came into the world through one man,
and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because all sinned&amp;#8221;. While
Augustine and the Reformers both took this latter phrase to mean &amp;#8220;all sinned &lt;em&gt;in
Adam&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8221; it must be recognized that the idea that all sinned &amp;#8220;in Adam&amp;#8221; is foreign
to the text. Indeed, the sentence that follows immediately on the heels of this
first declaration suggest that it is individuals&amp;#8217; sins committed in their own
lives, and not Adam&amp;#8217;s sin, that is in view here. Otherwise, the distinction
between the sins that some committed before the law came and the sins that
others committed after the law came makes little sense. So likewise does the
distinction between Adam&amp;#8217;s sin and that of those who followed him, even those
whose sin was not like&amp;nbsp;his.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most significant textual challenge to this understanding comes in Paul&amp;#8217;s
statement that &amp;#8220;death spread to all men because all sinned&amp;#8221;&amp;#8212;a statement that
is hard to reconcile with the notion of the lack of conscious sin in infants or
the mentally handicapped. Certainly many humans die in infancy, and indeed many
die &lt;em&gt;in utero&lt;/em&gt; long before the cognitive ability to make any choice whatsoever
has developed. Thus, there is at least some sense in which Paul&amp;#8217;s argument
entails the death of human beings who have not yet come under condemnation for
their own sin because of Adam&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of the views outlined above resolve this tension perfectly. The Augustinian
view seems overly bound up in Augustine&amp;#8217;s views on sexual intercourse as the
means of the transmission of sin to human nature. The federal headship view
places more emphasis on the idea of imputation than this passage seems to
support, but deals forthrightly with the issue of death in the lives of those
who have committed no sins. The idea that humans are born innocent of specific
guilt but subject to a sin nature that leads inevitably to sin seems to do
justice to the basic flow of Paul&amp;#8217;s argument, but struggles with the
application of death to those who have not&amp;nbsp;sinned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Integrating the latter two options seems the best solution. People die because
Adam corrupted human nature, and all participate in his corrupted human
nature&amp;#8212;a nature separated from the fellowship with God essential to human
immortality&amp;#8212;unless united to a &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; human nature. People are guilty
for their own sins, not for Adam&amp;#8217;s, but they die because they share Adam&amp;#8217;s
basic nature, which came out of his guilt. In due time, they themselves sin
they &lt;em&gt;earn&lt;/em&gt; the death in which they already shared by dint of their broken
humanity. Even this solution, it must be admitted, remains somewhat messier
than we might like, but it is to be preferred as best dealing with all the
evidence before&amp;nbsp;us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I leave aside non-orthodox positions such as the Pelagian view that people
are born able to live perfectly righteous lives, with uncorrupted natures, which
runs against the clear teaching of Scripture that all sin and moreover that all
&lt;em&gt;inevitably&lt;/em&gt; sin because of the fallenness of our humanity.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

descriptions and names tell us much about how the authors of the Bible
conceived of the power than enslaves us apart from&amp;nbsp;Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Old Testament has several terms its authors often use to describe the broad
concept of sin:&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="quo"&gt;&amp;lsquo;&lt;/span&gt;avah&lt;/em&gt;, meaning &amp;#8220;bent&amp;#8221; or&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;crooked&amp;#8221;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="quo"&gt;&amp;lsquo;&lt;/span&gt;aval&lt;/em&gt;, which includes the idea of a lack of integrity, so is often
  given as&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;iniquity&amp;#8221;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="quo"&gt;&amp;lsquo;&lt;/span&gt;avar&lt;/em&gt;, meaning &amp;#8220;to cross over&amp;#8221; or&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;transgress&amp;#8221;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;ra&amp;lsquo;&lt;/em&gt;, meaning &amp;#8220;the rule of&amp;nbsp;evil&amp;#8221;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;ma&amp;lsquo;al&lt;/em&gt;, meaning &amp;#8220;breach of&amp;nbsp;trust&amp;#8221;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;pasha&amp;lsquo;&lt;/em&gt;, meaning &amp;#8220;to revolt&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;refuse subjection to a rightful&amp;nbsp;authority&amp;#8221;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From these we see that humanity&amp;#8217;s brokenness before God in the Old Testament was
often conceived of in terms of doing things the wrong way, or in rejection of
the rightful authority, or a mix of the two. Rebellion against the creator and
his created order are essential ingredients of the concept of sin for the Old
Testament authors. To do evil is to be in rebellion against the right way God
established for things to be done, to reject his &lt;em&gt;shalom&lt;/em&gt; and replace it with
destruction and&amp;nbsp;disharmony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most common term for sin in the Old Testament, however, and the one usually
translated into the English &amp;#8220;sin&amp;#8221; is &lt;em&gt;chatha&lt;/em&gt;, meaning &amp;#8220;to miss the mark&amp;#8221;.
Sinning was thus not necessarily always a matter of active, willful rejection
of God. It was also simply failing, by dint of corrupted human nature, to do as
God called humanity to do, in any and all spheres of life. Sin was thus a
pervasive and corrupting influence on &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of human existence, not only on
those who were consciously rebelling against&amp;nbsp;God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, the New Testament picks up on many of these same ideas. Though
the specific terms used have different semantic ranges than those in the Old
Testament, as a group they cover much of the same&amp;nbsp;territory:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;parabasis&lt;/em&gt;, &amp;#8220;the transgression of a&amp;nbsp;boundary&amp;#8221;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;parakoe&lt;/em&gt;, &amp;#8220;disobedience to a&amp;nbsp;voice&amp;#8221;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;paraptoma&lt;/em&gt;, &amp;#8220;falling where one should have stood&amp;nbsp;upright&amp;#8221;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;agnoema&lt;/em&gt;, &amp;#8220;failing to know what one should have&amp;nbsp;known&amp;#8221;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;hettema&lt;/em&gt;, &amp;#8220;diminishing what should have been fully&amp;nbsp;rendered&amp;#8221;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;anomia&lt;/em&gt;, failing to observe a&amp;nbsp;law&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;plemmeleia&lt;/em&gt;, &amp;#8220;a discord in the harmonies of God&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;universe&amp;#8221;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the Old Testament range, they add this final notion of discord in the created
order&amp;#8212;a concept that was present in the Old Testament, to be sure, in the
notion of lost &lt;em&gt;shalom&lt;/em&gt;, but which was not so directly expressed. Again, as in
the Old Testament, these emphasize both failure to do and active rejection of
what is right. And, as in the Old Testament, the New Testament authors&amp;#8217; concept
of sin is most commonly expressed in a single word meaning &amp;#8220;missing the mark&amp;#8221;:
&lt;em&gt;hamartia&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This congruence between the Old and New Testament views of sin emphasizes the
fundamental unity between the various authors&amp;#8217; understanding of the issues at
stake. Sin is everything about humanity&amp;#8217;s failure to follow God&amp;#8217;s ways and live
in accord with his design for the universe. It encompasses the whole range of
human foibles, from  accidental failure and ignorance to the kind of rebellion
that shakes its fist at the heavens or boldly (and foolishly) proclaims that
there is no God. Sin is getting it wrong&amp;#8212;or, to put it another way that
better captures the breadth of Scriptural language on the issue, not getting it
&lt;em&gt;perfectly&lt;/em&gt; right, for whatever&amp;nbsp;reason.&lt;/p&gt;

any fruit in the garden except one: the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
If he ate from that tree, however, he would die the very day he ate of it
(Genesis 2:17). When, in Genesis 3, Adam and Eve ate the fruit of the tree of
the knowledge of good and evil, however, they did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; die&amp;#8212;at least, not
physically. Indeed, Adam lived to be over nine hundred years&amp;nbsp;old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What, then, did God mean when he told Adam that he would sure die the very day
he ate of the tree? Did he lie, or make a mistake, or change his mind after the
fact? Plainly put, no: none of these are true. Rather, all of them mistake the
nature of the death entailed in God&amp;#8217;s word to Adam. The death Adam immediately
experienced was not physical death but spiritual death. Physical death was a
consequence&amp;#8212;a symptom, as it were&amp;#8212;of his spiritual&amp;nbsp;death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This spiritual death was multifold, and we see the various elements of it traced
out in the explanation of the fall given in Genesis 3. First of all came
separation from God. Rather than being in right relationship with the creator,
Adam now needed restoration. Whereas he had enjoyed fellowship and relationship
with his maker, now Adam experienced fear at the thought of encountering him,
so that he hid himself when God came walking in the garden in the cool of the
day. The rest of the Old Testament traces this theme out in great detail; it is
constantly asking the question, &amp;#8220;How may these unrighteous people come before a
holy&amp;nbsp;God?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, God removed Adam from the means of grace he had supplied to sustain his
mortal body. He had provided a tree of life from which Adam could eat so that
his body would go on living without fail. After the fall, Adam was removed from
this supply, and so his body began to fall apart. He began to experience the
first phase of physical death: aging and decay. He no longer had access to the
supernatural sustenance he required not to&amp;nbsp;die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, he immediately experienced relational brokenness. The previously holy
and mutually delightful relationship he had experienced with his wife would now
be characterized by mutual blame and recriminations. Likewise, his sons would
not be loving brothers: one would kill the other. No more would he live in a
world characterized by peace and harmony, but one shaped by conflict and&amp;nbsp;war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of all of these, though, it was the first that was most important and deepest.
Adam&amp;#8217;s separation from God was at the root of all the other problems he now
faced. It was the lack of God&amp;#8217;s spirit in him that led to his physical death.
It was the lack of God&amp;#8217;s presence in their midst, and the brokenness of his
image in them, that led men and women to be in conflict rather than mutually
supporting one another. With this separation came a warp in the character of
humanity that comprised the final part of Adam&amp;#8217;s immediate death: no more would
his will be ready to obey God. Instead, he (and all his descendants) would be quick
to turn aside to go against the grain of God&amp;#8217;s universe. Given the opportunity,
all would sin, and no one would turn away from sin without God&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, Adam &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; experience death the very day, indeed the very moment, that he
ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The death was more profound
and more horrifying than physical death alone would have been, though, because
it was a death that stretched to every point of his life, from his family and
the tasks with which God had entrusted him, to his very connection with God.
Everything became broken in him, and he no longer knew God. In gaining the
knowledge of good and evil, he lost the knowledge of the one of whom knowledge
matters&amp;nbsp;most.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chris Krycho</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 05 Mar 2014 14:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:www.chriskrycho.com,2014-03-05:2014/in-the-day-that-you-eat-of-it.html</guid><category>M.&amp;hairsp;Div.</category></item><item><title>Call and Response</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/call-and-response.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;The ways in which the Bible draws on itself are sometimes astounding. A case in
point: as is so often the case in my readings, the New Testament reading seems
almost as though drawing explicitly on the Old Testament reading. I should note:
I am not following a lectionary or any particular plan, so it is not as though
this is an intentional thing. Indeed, my reading plan right now is basically:
Psalms, Proverbs, wherever I need to be reading for my Old Testament survey
class, and wherever I feel like reading in the New Testament. Not particularly
complicated! The reason is simpler than a formal plan: it is that the authors
were aware of each other, and later authors clearly drew quite consciously on
the material left behind by those who went before&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A case in point: Romans 1&amp;#8211;3 and Psalm 53 both show us the state of humanity
quite clearly. They get there in different ways, of course. The Psalm arrives by
way of poetic rhythm and the steadily building refrain that there are those who
reject God, culminating in the expectation of judgment on the enemies of God
and blessings for his people (typical enough themes of the Psalms, in some
ways.) In his letter to Rome, Paul builds up this notion by carefully measured
argument (which is not to suggest any lack of &lt;em&gt;verve&lt;/em&gt; in said argument&amp;#8212;this
is Paul we are talking about!) until he comes to the oft-cited and
less-often-really-grasped reality that &amp;#8220;all have sinned and fall short of the
glory of God&amp;#8221; (Romans&amp;nbsp;3:23).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was most striking about Psalm and epistle alike to me was not only their
congruity on the state of humanity, but also their agreement on the answer to
that problem. (This is not &lt;em&gt;surprising&lt;/em&gt;. Just &lt;em&gt;striking&lt;/em&gt;. Note well the
difference between the two!) Both look not to human accomplishment or
restitution for undone deeds and deeds that ought to have been left undone, but
to the God who can save his people. The Psalmist cried out, praying, &amp;#8220;Oh, that
salvation for Israel would come out of Zion!&amp;#8221; (Psalm 53:6). Paul&amp;nbsp;answers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart from the law,
although the Law and the Prophets bear witness to it—the righteousness of God
through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe. For there is no
distinction: for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are
justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ
Jesus, whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, to be received by
faith. This was to show God&amp;#8217;s righteousness, because in his divine forbearance
he had passed over former sins. It was to show his righteousness at the
present time, so that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has
faith in&amp;nbsp;Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then what becomes of our boasting? It is excluded. By what kind of law? By a
law of works? No, but by the law of faith. For we hold that one is justified
by faith apart from works of the law. Or is God the God of Jews only? Is he
not the God of Gentiles also? Yes, of Gentiles also, since God is one—who will
justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through faith.
(Romans&amp;nbsp;3:21-30)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salvation &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; come for Israel, from Israel, but not only to Israel. Salvation
came also to the nations. For that, I am profoundly grateful: &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; am the
nations, as is almost everyone reading this. We stood condemned under the law
of our conscience just as the Jewish people stood condemned by the law God had
given them. All of us stood in desperate need of intervention, and so God
intervened. All peoples sin, and all peoples&lt;sup id="fnref:s"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:s" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; are justified by God&amp;#8217;s grace.
God is perfectly just, and he does not just overlook sin. He judges it. But he
has judged it &lt;em&gt;in Christ&lt;/em&gt;, and not in you or&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hallelujah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plurals here are important. It is very different to say that all
&lt;em&gt;peoples&lt;/em&gt; will be saved than it is to say that all &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt; will be saved.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:s" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

the two paths which the remainder of the book traces out in greater detail,
highlights the value of wisdom and gives the first few details as to what it
looks like to walk in wisdom. First and foremost, wisdom is a matter of walking
with Yahweh, in accord with his revelation of himself. Verses 3&amp;#8211;4 make this
abundantly clear, echoing as they do Moses&amp;#8217; words to Israel in giving them the
law. Just as the people of God were to bind his law on their bodies and their
hearts, so the author of the Proverbs exhorts his son to remember &amp;#8220;steadfast
love and faithfulness&amp;#8221;&amp;#8212;the very attributes with which Yahweh characterized
himself in that climactic moment on the mountain in &lt;cite class="bibleref"
title="Ex 34.6"&gt;Exodus 34&lt;/cite&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So although some scholars have asserted that the Proverbs (and indeed the rest
of the literature) developed totally separately from the Law of Israel, such a
proposition looks to me more like wishful thinking on the part of secularists
than an accurate acknowledgement of the shape of the text. Proverbs is not
separate from the Torah. It is &lt;em&gt;commentary&lt;/em&gt; on the Torah. Indeed, there is no
part of the moral Law given to Israel that does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; come up for discussion in
the course of the book. Worshipping Yahweh is front and center. Murder and
adultery both come in for repeated admonition. Rejection of not only
covetousness and envy but also of the roots beneath them is pervasive. To put
it as Dr. Heath Thomas did in my Old Testament class several weeks ago: the
Torah told Israel &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; to do, and the Proverbs taught them &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Proverbs 3 sits as part of this project. Its famous admonition to trust
Yahweh and not to lean on one&amp;#8217;s own understanding is one of the lynchpins of
the book.&lt;sup id="fnref:eccl"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:eccl" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The whole book must be taken in light of this admonition.
Human wisdom is not God&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is no coincidence that the author of the book turns almost immediately from
exhorting his audience to trust in Yahweh rather than in human wisdom to a
picture of divine wisdom. Nor is it mere happenstance that he includes the
notion that Yahweh created the earth &lt;em&gt;by&lt;/em&gt; wisdom and established the heavens
&lt;em&gt;by&lt;/em&gt; understanding.&lt;sup id="fnref:by"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:by" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This is essential to understanding the shape and
argument of Proverbs. God made the world to work in a certain way, and we either
walk in that way or we do not. The way we have chosen&amp;#8212;our broken, sinful
path&amp;#8212;is not in line with the way the universe was designed. The way he has set
before us&amp;#8212;the way of reconciliation in Christ Jesus&amp;#8212;is the way of shalom.
And Proverbs thus is a guide for the Christian for what it means to follow
Christ. It is the light to our path as we seek to keep God&amp;#8217;s law, recognizing
that he who made all things has also shown us how to walk in line with the way
he made those things&amp;#8212;indeed, with how he made &lt;em&gt;us&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why we should not lean on our own understanding: because it is not only
flawed, but forever incomplete. Even when we are sanctified&amp;#8212;perhaps
&lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; when we are sanctified&amp;#8212;we will not lean on our own
understanding, but rest in the wisdom of the one who &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; wisdom, and who
shaped the universe to his&amp;nbsp;wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:eccl"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, I would note, the key to understanding the entire book of
Ecclesiastes. If we take Proverbs 3:5&amp;#8211;8 as a guide and then we read Ecclesiastes,
the problem that &lt;em&gt;Qoheleth&lt;/em&gt; had becomes clear rather quickly, and then is
reiterated throughout that book: the Preacher trusted his own wisdom instead of
God&amp;#8217;s. Proverbs is the foundational text for biblical wisdom, and other wisdom
books must be understood in light of it.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:eccl" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:by"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is impossible not to note the connection that New Testament authors
made to this concept in Christ, from John&amp;#8217;s description of Jesus as the
&lt;em&gt;Logos&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8212;which has in its semantic range not only the idea of &amp;#8220;word&amp;#8221; but of
&amp;#8220;reason&amp;#8221;&amp;#8212;to Paul&amp;#8217;s straightforward declaration that &amp;#8220;Christ Jesus&amp;#8230; became
for us wisdom from God&amp;#8221; (1 Cor. 1:30), and to the New Testament&amp;#8217;s oft-repeated
refrain that Christ was the agent of creation (cf. Col. 1:16, Heb. 1:10&amp;#8211;12,
2:10).&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:by" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chris Krycho</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2014 20:55:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:www.chriskrycho.com,2014-03-03:2014/wisdom-from-god.html</guid><category>devotions</category></item><item><title>A Broken and Contrite Heart</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/a-broken-and-contrite-heart.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Most often when reading through the Psalms in the past, I have taken them
primarily as a model for my own interactions with God&amp;#8212;not least when coming to
Psalms like Psalm 51. Here, David&amp;#8217;s extended prayer of repentance and
supplication to God has long seemed a good model for my own prayers of like
kind, and so it is&amp;#8212;but there is more to see in this passage than a model for
us. While the question, &lt;em&gt;Is there something to imitate (or something &lt;/em&gt;not&lt;em&gt; to
imitate) in this passage?&lt;/em&gt; is a good one, there is always another fruitful
question to ask of any text in the Bible: &lt;em&gt;What does this tell us about the
person and nature of God&amp;nbsp;himself?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can often be easy to let this question fall aside, and not only in the
Psalms. The temptation to miss this central issue in Scripture is no less strong
when working through narratives like those in Acts. In both cases, however, we
must remind ourselves that the scriptures are not merely the record of man&amp;#8217;s
response to God: they are God&amp;#8217;s revelation of himself to man. That distinction
will prevent us from running off in all sorts of unhelpful&amp;nbsp;directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Psalm 51, I learned today not only what a contrite response to God looks
like, but many things about the character of God himself. First and foremost, in
inspiring the editor of the Psalms to place this particular song of repentance
in the Bible at all, God emphasizes to us the need for real repentance. This
theme is doubly clear given the organization of the Psalms. David says here just
as Asaph had said in Psalm 50: God does not delight in burnt offerings in and of
themselves, but he does delight in hearts that worship God (cf. Psalm 50:8&amp;#8211;12,
51:16&amp;#8211;17). In fact, the two Psalms together make it abundantly clear that God
detests sacrifices offered &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; the right heart&amp;#8212;a theme that appears time
and again not only in the Psalms but also throughout the Prophets. God is not
the sort of being who is appeased by getting fragrant smoke or the scent of
barbecue in his nostrils.&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; He is instead the kind of being who is pleased by
genuine repentance&amp;#8212;turning from evil to righteousness, and by righteousness we
must mean dependence on&amp;nbsp;him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Psalm also draws forth several more salient points about the character of
God in the structure of the prayer. If God calls us to imitate this prayer, as
indeed he does, then it is because it speaks rightly and reflects right thought
about him. So we can take away from it&amp;nbsp;that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;he has mercy on people according to his steadfast love, and out of that mercy
  he &amp;#8220;blots out&amp;#8221; our transgressions (Ps.&amp;nbsp;51:1,9)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;he washes people of iniquity and cleanses us from our sin&amp;#8212;not only
  &lt;em&gt;forgiving&lt;/em&gt; our sin, but also &lt;em&gt;removing&lt;/em&gt; it from us (Ps.&amp;nbsp;51:2,7)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;he is the one against whom all sin finally is committed&amp;#8212;even our sins
  against others are also sins against him (Ps.&amp;nbsp;51:4)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;he is (and ought to be seen as) fully justified in his words&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and blameless
  in his judgment&amp;#8212;that is, that the way he rules and judges are completely
  right, and no one can have cause to find fault with them (Ps.&amp;nbsp;51:4)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;he delights in truth in the depths of our souls, and by implication hates
  hypocrisy (Ps.&amp;nbsp;51:6)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;he is the source of wisdom (Ps.&amp;nbsp;51:6)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;he is the source of any joy and gladness we have, &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; when we
  confront our own sin (Ps.&amp;nbsp;51:8,12)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;he is the one who can and does give us clean hearts and right spirits where we
  have fouled our own hearts and broken our spirits (Ps.&amp;nbsp;51:10)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;he may be far from us and may take his Spirit from us, but he desires that we
  be near to him and filled with his Spirit (Ps.&amp;nbsp;51:11)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;he upholds us (Ps.&amp;nbsp;51:12)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;he delivers us from guilt (Ps.&amp;nbsp;51:14)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;his goodness ought to be proclaimed to others and he ought to be praised (Ps.&amp;nbsp;51:13,14&amp;#8211;15)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;he does not despise broken-heartedness or contrition&amp;#8212;as did, say, the Greek
  philosophers (Ps.&amp;nbsp;51:17)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the end of the Psalm highlights that personal repentance has corporate
consequences, and so reminds us that God&amp;#8217;s work in our lives is not about us
alone. He is at work in his people. His work in restoring David impacted
Zion/Jerusalem. David&amp;#8217;s prayer did not stop with his own being set in right
relation with God, but extended to the people of God being in right relation
with God as well. The king &lt;em&gt;ought&lt;/em&gt; to have such a concern for his people&amp;#8212;and
here we have a pointer to the greater king who not only had such a concern but
who achieved it himself once and for&amp;nbsp;all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glory to God, and thanksgiving to him for his&amp;nbsp;self-revelation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be sure, the Old Testament sacrificial system did please God&amp;#8212;he
instituted it!&amp;#8212;and it culminated in the sacrifice of God the Son on our
behalf. But as the author Hebrews makes clear: the burnt offerings of the Old
Testament were never sufficient to save, and were always meant to point to
something greater than themselves. They were present to teach the Israelites
(and us) the necessity of God&amp;#8217;s salvation, and to point to the greater sacrifice
to come.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably including his law and his decrees about life.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

The book is challenging because it shows Christians facing extraordinary challenges and committing to proclaim Christ no matter the cost to themselves. (In these chapters, for example, Paul is dragged outside the city and stoned, after which he gets up and goes on proclaiming the gospel.) So often I find myself wishing that even the ordinary trials of my life would pass more quickly and am all too quick to complain about them (internally even when I am too socially savvy to do so out loud). Looking at Peter sitting in prison, fully expecting to die at the hands of Herod just as his master had, or at Paul and Barnabas nearly everywhere they went, I am challenged to grow deeper in my own faith and my own commitment to Christ. I am convicted that I ought to complain less and praise God more, that I ought indeed to be thankful to God for the opportunity to show that I value him more than the passing comforts and pleasures of this world (even as I offer heartfelt lament to him at the brokenness of this&amp;nbsp;world).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the record of Acts is encouraging because it is abundantly clear throughout the book that the church advanced because the Spirit of God was empowering otherwise ordinary men and women to do great things for him. As Paul himself put it to a crowd who tried to worship him and Barnabas, &amp;#8220;We are also men!&amp;#8221; (Acts 14:15). As extraordinary as the faith these men and women demonstrated was, they were just people like you and me who God used. This is encouraging looking at myself, and looking around at the state of the church. Though we are all frail and broken, often quick to seek the world&amp;#8217;s favor on the one hand and insular and unwilling to engage the lost on the other, hesitant and fainting in our proclamation of the gospel, hungry for men&amp;#8217;s affirmation over God&amp;#8217;s, little in faith, weak or inarticulate in speech, insufficiently thoughtful, unkind and sometimes overly politic, licentious and legalistic&amp;#8212;still God can use us, and still it is ultimately he who saves and not we. Paul had his sharp edges, Peter his fear of man, and the early church no small number of legalistic ascetics and licentious antinomians, but God was at work nonetheless. His Spirit drew people to Christ through these earthen vessels, and he is doing the same today. God uses us in spite of our foibles, and in truth sometimes he uses us in the particular ways he does because our foibles highlight that it is he and not we who are really at&amp;nbsp;work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, then, the book of Acts is joyfully humbling. It is convicting of the need for deeper faith, and it is convincing of the need to depend on God. Both of these are cause for joy, though. Deeper faith and greater commitment to make much of Christ will bear great fruit in our lives and in the world around us when it is coupled in greater dependence on the Spirit of God to work rather than on our own techniques. Hallelujah. Go and make&amp;nbsp;disciples.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chris Krycho</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2014 19:55:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:www.chriskrycho.com,2014-02-26:2014/joyfully-humbling.html</guid><category>devotions</category></item><item><title>Wisdom Literature and Death</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/wisdom-literature-and-death.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;The Psalms contain a remarkable breadth of material. They range from Messianic and &lt;a href="/2014/the-city-of-god.html"&gt;Zionic&lt;/a&gt; songs to hymns of ovation and from laments to songs of Ascent. And they include, as here in Psalm 49, wisdom literature not so different from that which we find in Proverbs or Job or Ecclesiastes. Life is brief, these sons of Korah remind us, and when we come to the end of it, we can take nothing with us. No accumulated wealth, no pomp or prosperity, can pass death&amp;#8217;s forbidding&amp;nbsp;gates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is especially striking that this comes as part of the Psalmists&amp;#8217; answer to the question of how to respond to the apparent victories of cheaters and evildoers in the world around them. The very point that so perplexed the author of Ecclesiastes&amp;#8212;that righteous and unrighteous men alike die when all is said and done&amp;#8212;is here a point of comfort to the Psalmists. It is as if the same reality, understood differently, carries with it an entirely different meaning. And so it is. We have here one of the keys to understanding the way that the Scriptures teach us to think about the world in which we live. It is not only that the righteous and the unrighteous both die, coming sometimes without any judgment in this life to the end of their days and so passing away in seeming injustice. It is also that the injustice that they perpetrate does not and cannot endure forever; it will come to an end in the finality with which death greets all our&amp;nbsp;doings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether that end is a cause for despair or for hope comes down to a matter of wisdom. The fool looks and says, &amp;#8220;The wicked prosper&amp;#8212;I shall join them!&amp;#8221; The seemingly wise person looks and says, &amp;#8220;The wicked prosper&amp;#8212;let us all despair!&amp;#8221; The truly wise person looks and says, &amp;#8220;The wicked prosper&amp;#8212;but not&amp;nbsp;forever!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two notes that are all the more noteworthy in Psalm 49 for the way it otherwise fits into the context of ancient Israelite wisdom literature, and both relate to this same theme of coming death. In verses 7&amp;#8211;9, and again in verse 15, there are words that cannot but make the attentive Christian reader think of things beyond the Old Testament&amp;#8217;s vision of death. Verses 7&amp;#8211;9 remind&amp;nbsp;us:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Truly no man can ransom another,
    or give to God the price of his life,
for the ransom of their life is costly
    and can never suffice,
that he should live on forever
    and never see the pit.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, as I have noted, was a cause for hope for these songwriters, strange though that seems at first blush. But it also speaks to the reality we all face in a way that seemes aimed directly at the hope we see in some of the Prophets and brought fully to light in the New Testament. Someone &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; ransom men and gave to God the price of his life, paid fully the ransom that did suffice so we might live on forever and never see the pit. No man indeed could do this. But God himself could, and did. And the Psalmists seems to have seen this coming (verse&amp;nbsp;15):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;But God will ransom my soul from the power of Sheol,
    for he will receive me. Selah.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is exactly what has happened to us all. God has ransomed our souls from the power of death, and he is the one who will receive&amp;nbsp;us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hallelujah.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chris Krycho</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 25 Feb 2014 21:30:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:www.chriskrycho.com,2014-02-25:2014/wisdom-literature-and-death.html</guid><category>devotions</category></item><item><title>Sufficiency and Efficacy</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/sufficiency-and-efficacy.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;The extent of the atonement is one of the most debated topics in the history of
the church for centuries. Whether Jesus Christ&amp;#8217;s death provided substition for
the sins of all people or just some has been the cause of many dissensions and
denominational splits in the Protestant world ever since the Reformation. Most
famously, Arminius and his followers were expelled from the Calvinistic churches
over this very issue and the way they worked out their stance in other areas of&amp;nbsp;doctrine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the most part, though, what is at issue is not whether Jesus&amp;#8217; death was of
sufficient merit to save all people. Jesus the incarnate Son of God provided a
sacrifice of infinite worth, undoubtedly of sufficient worth to cover all the
sins of all mankind in all of history. Rather, the question is to whom the
atonement is applied and how&amp;#8212;or, to put it differently, to whom its benefits
are available. Thus, the phrases of &amp;#8220;limited atonement&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;unlimited
atonement&amp;#8221; are best understood as referring to the availability and effect of
the atonement, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to its&amp;nbsp;value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, it must be recognized that all orthodox Christians affirm that the
effects of the atonement are limited in at least one important sense: not all
people are redeemed, and therefore not all people benefit from the atonement of
Christ. To put it as many have before, all orthodox believers affirm that the
atonement was &amp;#8220;sufficient for all, but efficient for some,&amp;#8221; for if it was
&amp;#8220;efficient&amp;#8221; for all, then all would be saved. (To affirm any lesser effect is to
diminish the atonement. This is not to say that there may not be other, broader
effects of Christ&amp;#8217;s death on the cross&amp;#8212;e.g. the notion of prevenient grace
enabling all to respond to the preached word&amp;#8212;only that the atonement itself is
not applied universally.) The question then is only who those &amp;#8220;some&amp;#8221; are and the
terms under which the atonement is available to&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simplest answer is simply to say, &amp;#8220;the elect!&amp;#8221; and have done, leaving aside
the tendentious question of who is elect&amp;#8212;but this question is precisely where
the rubber meets the road on the issue of the atonement. After all, everyone
agrees that the only the sins of those who believe are actually removed in
Christ, regardless of how election works out. Thus, when people speak of
&amp;#8220;limited&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;unlimited&amp;#8221; atonement, they are usually speaking of the issue of
general or specific election. Does the work of Christ mean that all are equally
able to hear and respond to the gospel, or does it mean that only the elect are
enabled to hear and&amp;nbsp;respond?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the most faithful articulation of the matter is to speak of the
atonement in three ways. First, we affirm that Jesus&amp;#8217; death was sufficient to
atone for the sins of the world&amp;#8212;&lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the world. Second, we offer the
atonement freely to everyone. Although the only the elect will be saved (however
we understand that to play out), the Scriptures clearly enjoin us to proclaim
Christ&amp;#8217;s subtitutionary death and justifying resurrection to sinners everywhere
and to urge everyone to repent and trust in him. Third, we affirm that the
saving work of the atonement is applied to the sins of those who confess Christ
as Savior and Lord and obey him. We need not perfectly understand or agree upon
the means by which people come to confess Christ as Lord to affirm that it is
only in that affirmation and obedience that one&amp;#8217;s sins are covered in the&amp;nbsp;atonement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is thus most appropriate to speak of Jesus&amp;#8217; atonement as unlimited in extent
but limited in&amp;nbsp;effect.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chris Krycho</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 25 Feb 2014 08:30:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:www.chriskrycho.com,2014-02-25:2014/sufficiency-and-efficacy.html</guid><category>M.&amp;hairsp;Div.</category></item><item><title>Goodbye, Chrome</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/goodbye-chrome.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Last week, Chrome crossed the line for me. I deleted it from my system to clean
up its many hooks into my system&amp;#8212;I searched out every trace of it I could
find&amp;#8212;and will put it back on my system only for testing websites. Why? Because
it&amp;#8217;s just too creepy&amp;nbsp;now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s the story: two weekends ago, I was sitting at a coffee shop working on a
friend&amp;#8217;s website, when up popped a series of Google Now &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; X desktop
notifications from Chrome, informing me of the weather, a package having
recently shipped, and so&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were just two problems with&amp;nbsp;this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I never gave Chrome permission to do anything of the&amp;nbsp;sort.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was not signed into Chrome or any Google service at the&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Number 1 is bothersome. Number 2 is so far beyond bothersome that I took the
nuclear option. Let&amp;#8217;s walk through&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google apparently decided to start opting people into Google Now on the Chrome
33 Beta. Opting people into anything new is nearly always a bad idea in my view;
opting someone into something that actively integrates with email, calendar,
etc. without asking them is just creepy. Now, full disclosure: I had previously
granted Google access to some of this data for Google Now on my Android phone
(though I have since moved to an iPhone). However, as is usual for Google these
days, the company took that permission in one context and treated it as global
permission in all&amp;nbsp;contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No doubt the box I checked when I gave them access to that data in the first
place legally allowed them to continue touching it. That did not particularly
bother me. Rather, it was the assumption that I wanted the same kind of
interactions from the service in a different context. This is typical of Google
&amp;#8212;typically un-human-friendly, that is. People do different things with their
phones than with their browsers, and have different expectations of what each
will do. More importantly, though, even if we might &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; our browsers to start
supplying us the kinds of sometimes-valuable information that we get from Google
Now (or Apple or Microsoft&amp;#8217;s similar tools), we generally want the opportunity
to make that decision. Increasingly, Google is making that decision for its
users, leaving them to opt out and turn it off if they so desire. That is not a
policy I particularly like. So: strike one. Or rather: strike several dozen, of
the sort that had me moving away from Google&amp;#8217;s services for quite some time&amp;#8212;
but it probably still wouldn&amp;#8217;t have pushed me across the line to this kind of
hard kill-it-with-fire&amp;nbsp;mentality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What did? That would be the part where Chrome started sending me desktop Google
Now notifications. Without asking me. In a browser to which I was not logged in,
nor logged into any Google&amp;nbsp;services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will say that again to be clear: I was not signed into Chrome. I was not
signed into any Google services in the browser. I had not allowed the browser to
create desktop notifications. And it started sending me Google Now notifications
for my main Google account. Worse: nothing I could do with the browser itself
changed that behavior. (Unsurprising: there was no way Chrome should have been
able to do that in the first place, logged out of all Google services as I&amp;nbsp;was.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goodbye, Chrome. You&amp;#8217;re just too&amp;nbsp;creepy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was not the first time I have seen Chrome engage in behavior that does not
respect its users. I have repeatedly run into cases where clearing the cache and
deleting browsers&amp;#8230; doesn&amp;#8217;t. Cookies sometimes still stick around. Private
browsing sessions inherit cookies from the main window (and sometimes vice
versa). Closing a private session and launching a new one would sometimes still
include cookies and cache from a previous session (bank accounts still logged
in, etc.). Chrome had thus long been untrustworthy to me. But this was a bridge
too far. This was not just slightly unnerving. It was&amp;nbsp;creepy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Call it a bug if you like. It is likely that it was, in fact, a bug. So, most
likely, were the other cases I saw above. But these are the kinds of bugs that
make a browser fundamentally untrustworthy, and they are the kinds of bugs that
are that much creepier coming from a company whose profit comes almost entirely
from selling advertising&amp;#8212;that is, from selling user information to advertising
companies. The deal was that we trusted Google not to abuse that information.
Unfortunately, that deal just keeps getting worse all the time. (Pray they do
not alter it&amp;nbsp;further.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will have a copy of the browser on my system for testing purposes, but for
nothing else. Goodbye, Chrome. And for that matter: goodbye, Google services.
Over the course of the rest of this year, I will be moving myself completely off
of all Google services (mail, calendar, etc.), with the sole exception of (non-
logged-in) search. You&amp;#8217;re just too creepy&amp;nbsp;now.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chris Krycho</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2014 15:20:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:www.chriskrycho.com,2014-02-24:2014/goodbye-chrome.html</guid></item><item><title>The City of God</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/the-city-of-god.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;As I work through the Psalms after having covered them in my Old Testament
survery class, a few themes are much more apparent to me than they had been
before. Notably, looking at Psalm 48, the prominence of Zion throughout the
Psalms and in this Psalm in particular is striking. It is of course not Zion
itself that is the cause for note and rejoicing, but the presence of Yahweh
within the city. (The temple in this city is where God makes his dwelling place
on earth&amp;#8212;a striking thought!) But the city does come in for special notice
because Yahweh dwells there, and does so often throughout the Old
Testament.&lt;sup id="fnref:nt"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:nt" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great is the &lt;span class=smcp&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; and greatly to be praised&lt;br /&gt;
    in the city of our God!&lt;br /&gt;
His holy mountain, beautiful in elevation,&lt;br /&gt;
    is the joy of all the earth,&lt;br /&gt;
Mount Zion, in the far north,&lt;br /&gt;
    the city of the great King. (Psalm&amp;nbsp;48:1–2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The temple of God, his dwelling place with and among us, comes up over and over
again throughout the Scriptures. It is there from the very beginning, from Eden
where God would walk with his people in the cool of the day. It is there in the
end, in the New Jerusalem where the dwelling place of God is with man and there
is no temple at all because God himself is the temple. It is here, now, in the
time when the people of God have replaced a building and become a temple of
living&amp;nbsp;stones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Psalmist&amp;#8217;s call to survey Zion (Psalm 48:12&amp;#8211;13a) does what all such calls
in the Scriptures do: it points the listener to the God whose dwelling place
Zion is (48:13b&amp;#8211;14). Yahweh will establish this city forever (48:8) as a mark
of his triumph over the (rebellious) nations, and as a result his name&amp;#8212;that
is, knowledge of him and his character&amp;#8212;and his praise will fill the ends of
the earth. And the end of people coming to this city will be that all will know
that &amp;#8220;this is our God, / our God forever and ever. He will guide us
forever.&amp;#8221;&lt;sup id="fnref:forever"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:forever" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meditating on Zion&amp;#8212;that is, on Jerusalem both old and new&amp;#8212;does not seem at
first blush a fertile ground for worship. But that is exactly where the Psalmist
has taken us. The old Jerusalem was the city that rejected the prophets and
finally rejected the prophet like Moses, the promised Davidic king (a point
driven home rather forcefully in Stephen&amp;#8217;s monologue in Acts 7, which I also
read today). Though it was the dwelling place of God, it was also the city that
rejected God&amp;#8212;much as Adam and Eve had done in Eden. That even so God dwelt
there, that even so God dwells with us who are so often so very sinful, is
nothing short of astounding. That he will someday bring down a new Jerusalem
that he has made, and in which he will be both the spiritual center and the
righteous ruler, is the more astounding&amp;nbsp;yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So with the Psalmist, I thank God for his city. And with the Psalmist, I look
forward to the day when God shows his glory to all the earth through his&amp;nbsp;city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:nt"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the New. But I&amp;#8217;ll get to that.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:nt" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:forever"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Forever&amp;#8221; here has sometimes been read as &amp;#8220;beyond death.&amp;#8221; There&amp;#8217;s a
striking image in the Old Testament, opaque about the fate of men and women
after death as it usually is!&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:forever" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

devotions, and certainly not the other few pieces I had been planning to write.
This was disappointing: I have enjoyed the habit of writing regularly, and I
intend to keep it up. As I have often noted in the past (in more blog posts on
previous versions of the site than I can count, still less dig up at the
moment), writing serves to focus my thoughts as little else does. Moreover,
though my &lt;a href="/devotions"&gt;#devotions&lt;/a&gt; posts are not especially excellent as
writing goes, the discipline of writing is like many other things: sometimes it
matters most that you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; it more than the doing of it be particularly&amp;nbsp;magnificent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of my running is this way. The vast majority of my runs are entirely
unexceptional and become notable only in their consistency. They are not tiring
and not particularly fast&amp;#8212;for me, at least! This is an important
qualification, I recognize, though one that is nonetheless closely tied to the
very ordinary nature of these runs. They become interesting, and are effective,
only in the aggregate. My entire training plan is built on going slowly and
training the &amp;#8220;easy&amp;#8221; side of my physiological response to running. The effect
over time is extraordinary, though: my easy runs with a toddler in a stroller
today are faster than my best runs alone were a few years&amp;nbsp;ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My hope for this year is to do something the same with my writing. I do not
expect that the majority of my words will be particularly elegant or well-put-
together. I expect most of my posts to go largely unread and unnoticed, and that
is perfectly fine with me&amp;#8212;indeed, &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; than fine, because I am writing them
first of all as a double act of self-discipline. From those devotional posts I
hope to gain not an audience but the benefit of thoughtful reflection the
Scriptures I read and the helpful effect of regular writing on my &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when, as in the last few days, I simply cannot get to that writing because
other things intrude, I have a double response. First, I recognize that this is
totally all right, under the circumstances. Jaimie and I have been spending time
with friends and each other, and my normal writing times in the evenings have
simply been elided by those other activities. Second, though, I recognize that
such things are likely to come up often, and as such am motivated to commit once
again to doing this writing in the mornings as much as&amp;nbsp;possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For several weeks in the beginning of the semester this spring, I was able to
get up, do my reading, and do my writing before I went to class at 8am. A few
weeks ago, Jaimie&amp;#8217;s grandmother passed away and we flew her out for the funeral,
and that weekend completely tossed my habits and schedule out of alignment.
Instead of my two normally scheduled tasks for the weekend (school and work), I
had three&amp;#8212;and one of them in the form of a teething toddler. The other two
slipped. I have only just finally caught up, and as such I am hoping that in the
week ahead I shall be able to resume my previously very effective habits of
doing all these things to &lt;em&gt;start&lt;/em&gt; the day rather than to finish&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That, of course, assumes I get over this blasted cold that I seem to have caught
last night&amp;#8230; Life is a funny thing,&amp;nbsp;sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chris Krycho</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 23 Feb 2014 10:30:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:www.chriskrycho.com,2014-02-23:2014/on-days-off.html</guid></item><item><title>A Mighty Change</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/a-mighty-change.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;One of the most remarkable transformations in history comes in the beginning of
the second chapter of Acts. A group of obviously-still-confused men and women
were gathered for prayer, and the Holy Spirit came like fire on them and set the
world on its head. The epoch-making change in this group of people is shocking
to consider. In Acts 1, only a few weeks earlier, these same disciples had been
expecting the resurrected Jesus to restore the kingdom to Israel. This is truly
marvelous: Jesus the Christ had risen from the dead, and all his teachings had
still not sunk in. They still did not understand that what he was about was the
restoration of &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; things, not only the restoration of Israel. This was why
they needed the Holy Spirit: although they had been given explanation after
explanation, some of them incredibly clear (as to the disciples on the road to
Emmaus after Jesus&amp;#8217; resurrection from the dead).  It did not matter: they still
did not&amp;nbsp;understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then the Holy Spirit came, and as promised (see Acts 1:5 and cf. John 14ff.)
the Spirit gave them understanding and wisdom like they could scarcely have
imagined before. The external changes are notable in many ways: suddenly these
disciples were speaking in languages they did not know and performing
astonishing miracles. But the internal changes are what really tell us what
happened. Peter and the others transformed from people dominated by fear to
people characterized by bold confidence in the Lord&amp;#8212;and not just any &amp;#8220;lord&amp;#8221;,
but his Lord Jesus Christ. Likewise, whereas before they had still mistakenly
been looking foran earthly rule, Peter and the others now recognized that Christ
demanded allegiance no less when reigning beside his father in Heaven than he
would have taking up a kingship here on earth. &amp;#8220;Repent and believe,&amp;#8221; they cry
out to all, &amp;#8220;and your sins will be forgiven and the Lord God will be your&amp;nbsp;God.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And each of us is filled with this self-same Holy Spirit, the means of the Son&amp;#8217;s
work for the Father in the Trinity. We have in us the same spirit that raised
Jesus Christ from the dead, animated the early church, and has given life to his
people ever since. This is not small thing. Indeed, though we tend in
intellectual Reformed circles largely to overlook the work of the Spirit, and
though our Charismatic brothers tend to emphasize points that Scripture does
not, we need to invest more time in understanding the Spirit and his work
rightly. But in any case, we have this glorious treasure: Christ formed in us by
the very means of the salvation of the world, his&amp;nbsp;Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chris Krycho</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2014 23:12:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:www.chriskrycho.com,2014-02-19:2014/a-mighty-change.html</guid><category>devotions</category></item><item><title>A Commentary on the Rest of the Bible</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/a-commentary-on-the-rest-of-the-bible.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Once again, reading the Psalms in conjunction with Revelation is a striking
experience. Psalm 46 could be a meditation on the prophecies of Revelation 14&amp;#8211;
22, in many ways&amp;#8230; but of course, this has it backwards. It is not surprising
that the Psalms (or indeed almost any other part of the Bible) should sound like
a complement to Revelation when held up next to the final book. Reading through
Revelation this week hammered home just how familiar John was with the rest of
the Bible. Whether he knew the Pauline corpus to quote it is hard to say,&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
but he certainly quotes and alludes to sayings of Jesus that are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; in the
gospel of John but are in the other gospels, and of course his command of the
Old Testament is astounding. In fact, in many ways, Revelation reads like a
summary and recapitulation of the rest of the Bible, set in apocalyptic terms
that herald the end of the age and the consummation of all&amp;nbsp;things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revelation can be confusing, to be sure, but after having spent several years
away from the book,&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and now coming back to it again much more familiar with
the rest of the Bible,&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; its confusing points dim in light of what is clear to
me. That is: for all that John records many visions, he spends at least as much
time repeating themes and statements and phrases from the rest of the Scripture,
tying together what had previously been disparate elements into a unified whole.
In the course of the book, I think John quotes every major prophet and
references every (or nearly every) major apocalyptic image presented throughout
the Old Testament and many or most of those in the New. He certainly also
references Psalms and the Pentateuch; I would feel confident guessing that there
are references to the historical writings and wisdom literature that I simply&amp;nbsp;missed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, John&amp;#8217;s command of the rest of the Scriptures is simply astounding.
John was not only the recipient of visions; he was also a masterful expositor of
the word of God. The revelation was given to him, I think, at least in part
because he had so thoroughly learned the rest of the Bible and could rightly
situate the visions he was given in the rest of salvation history. As each page
fills up with quote after quote and allusion after allusion to the rest of the
great book of God&amp;#8217;s work, Revelation becomes more and more&amp;nbsp;comprehensible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be sure, some of the details remain fuzzy.&lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; But what comes through clearly
&amp;#8212;not least through the constant references to the rest of Scripture&amp;#8212;is that
the Lord God, the All-Powerful,&lt;sup id="fnref:5"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; will in the end bring justice on the earth.
He will destroy Satan and crush evil and end the cosmic rebellion against the
only good and true one. He will establish righteousness and justice and peace on
the earth. He will give eternal life to those who worship him. God will dwell
with man.&amp;nbsp;Hallelujah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He who testifies to these things says, &amp;#8220;Surely I am coming soon.&amp;#8221; Amen. Come,
Lord&amp;nbsp;Jesus!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all. Amen. (Revelation 22:20&amp;#8211;21, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESV&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least, for this non-expert who hasn&amp;#8217;t explicitly looked for quotes from
or allusions to Paul in Revelation.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last time I read through Revelation was sometime in 2012, I believe,
as I read through the whole Bible that year.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have spent a great deal of time reading and re-reading the Prophets and
the Gospels over the course of 2013 and early 2014.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:4"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As indeed at least some of them likely did to the original audience; I
strongly suspect that we are not &lt;em&gt;meant&lt;/em&gt; to understand perfectly all that is
shown in Revelation.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:4" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:5"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A rendering I picked up from the &lt;a href="http://lexhamenglishbible.com"&gt;Lexham English Bible&lt;/a&gt;,
and which I rather like.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:5" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chris Krycho</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 18 Feb 2014 23:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:www.chriskrycho.com,2014-02-18:2014/a-commentary-on-the-rest-of-the-bible.html</guid><category>devotions</category></item><item><title>The Greater Messiah</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/the-greater-messiah.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;It is nearly impossible to read Psalm 45 as a New Covenant believer in Yahweh
without seeing its contents in terms of Christ and his bride, the church. That
the Psalm was written with an ordinary bride for a normal king of Israel in mind
is a trifle mind-boggling, in fact, given how perfectly the Psalm ends up
picturing the Messianic realities in which we now live and whose final
fulfillment we now await. It is, in short, a perfect picture of how the Holy
Spirit superintended the composition of Scripture so that over time (and
especially with the Advent of Jesus the Messiah) all the words have been filled
up with more meaning.&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many Messianic poems in the Psalter, and few (if any) of them were
originally written with a clear expectation of a future God-man Messiah. They
speak of normal human kings&amp;#8212;the &amp;#8220;anointed ones&amp;#8221; of Israel&amp;#8212;in hopeful and
prayerful terms, terms that God then filled up in himself when he came and dwelt
among us.&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; They speak of the aspirations of Israel that were always dashed on
the rocks of human fallibility, and which were finally fulfilled by inversion in
a king who died at the hands of oppressors rather than toppling them. They speak
of the King who, though his reign has been inaugurated since he rose from that
death, has still not put his enemies under his feet. Israel waited, and we&amp;nbsp;wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading the Psalm next to the Revelation given to John only makes these thematic
ties more apparent. The Psalmist&amp;nbsp;writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Gird your sword on your thigh, O mighty one,
    in your splendor and majesty!
In your majesty ride out victoriously
    for the cause of truth and meekness and righteousness;
    let your right hand teach you awesome deeds!
Your arrows are sharp
    in the heart of the king's enemies;
    the peoples fall under you. (Psalm 45:3-5, ESV)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And John&amp;nbsp;writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the seventh angel blew his trumpet, and there were loud voices in heaven,
saying, &amp;#8220;The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of
his Christ, and he shall reign forever and ever.&amp;#8221; And the twenty-four elders
who sit on their thrones before God fell on their faces and worshiped God,&amp;nbsp;saying,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;"We give thanks to you, Lord God Almighty,
    who is and who was,
for you have taken your great power
    and begun to reign.
The nations raged,
    but your wrath came,
    and the time for the dead to be judged,
and for rewarding your servants, the prophets and saints,
    and those who fear your name,
    both small and great,
and for destroying the destroyers of the earth." (Revelation 11:15-18, ESV)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Anointed King that Israel was looking for will reign. He will put all his
enemies under his feet. His bride will come to him in splendor, and be radiant
and beautiful beyond measure. It is not exactly what the Psalmist had in mind,
because it is better. So it often is in our lives, I think. We look for lesser
things. We look for only what we can imagine and conceive, and our imaginations
and conceptions are extraordinarily small and limited by comparison with the
things of God. To be sure, in my own life I have often been limited to a very
small view of God&amp;#8217;s plans and purposes. More and more I recognize that his
wisdom is greater than I can begin to grasp, and from that see the necessity of
trusting and worshipping him all the more&amp;nbsp;fully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of that is looking with expectancy to Jesus&amp;#8217; return&amp;#8212;recognizing that even
the truest and best longings of my heart are but the shallowest hint of what he
willbring about when he returns. That the dwelling place of God will be with
man, that every evil will be crushed under his justice, and that the garden will
have become a glorious city where God will dwell with us and we with him? This
is more than I can grasp. But I can hope, and dream, and pray: &amp;#8220;Lord come&amp;nbsp;soon.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is no coincidence that the author of Hebrews quotes Psalm 45 at length,
explicitly applying vv. 6&amp;#8211;7 to Jesus as the one who is above all others.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Anointed one&amp;#8221; is, for example, the term David uses to describe Saul when
explaining why he would not kill him. This was the standard term for Israel&amp;#8217;s
kings. And just like so many other things, the Spirit filled it up with far more
meaning when Jesus came as &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; Anointed One.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chris Krycho</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2014 21:40:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:www.chriskrycho.com,2014-02-17:2014/the-greater-messiah.html</guid><category>devotions</category></item><item><title>Martyr-Saints</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/martyr-saints.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;As we were praying this evening, I spent a few minutes praying for our brothers
and sisters in North Korea. I was deeply moved by the reality that they face
every day&amp;#8212;persecution, imprisonment, death. There is nothing quite like it in
the Western experience of Christianity over the last 1700 years, and little like
it elsewhere in the world right now. To be sure, there is persecution that
saints around the world face, throughout both the Middle and Far East
especially. But North Korea is the harshest and most brutal place in the world
&amp;#8212;and there are men and women suffering and dying there for the name of Christ.
So we prayed for the end of the wicked tyranny of the country&amp;#8217;s current
leadership, and for the gospel to flourish there, and for those faithful saints
to be rewarded and&amp;nbsp;delivered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I read tonight in Revelation 4&amp;#8211;7. Two things stood out. The first I have
written about before in these devotional reflections: there is a clearly
articulated expectation of judgment on the eart. Chapter 6 is a fairly dreadful
picture of the wrath of God poured out on a sinful world, and it stands all the
more starkly for the reality tha t the majority of the content in these four
chapters is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; on judgment, bu ton God and his people. Indeed, these chapters
contain some of the most beautiful praises offered to God anywhere in&amp;nbsp;Scripture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Worthy are you to take the scroll
    and to open its seals,
for you were slain, and by your blood you ransomed people for God,
    from every tribe and language and people and nation,
and you have made them a kingdom and priests to our God,
    and they shall reign on the earth.
...
Worthy is the Lamb who was slain,
    to receive power and wealth and wisdom and might,
and honor and glory and blesing!
...
To him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb
    be blessing and honor and glory and might forever and ever!
(Revelation 5:9b--10,12b, 13b)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set in the midst of this, and against the backdrop of praise and judgment, is
this striking&amp;nbsp;image:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who
had been slain for the word of God and for the witness they ahd borne. They
cried out with a loud voice, &amp;#8220;O Sovereign Lord, holy and true, how long before
you will judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?&amp;#8221; Then
they were each given a white robe and told to rest a little longer, until the
number of their fellow servants and their brothers should be complete, who
were to be killed as they themselves had been. (Revelation&amp;nbsp;6:9&amp;#8211;11)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The martyrs of God are asked to wait a bit longer, to be yet more patient,
before God executes judgment on the earth. And why? Because the number of
martyrs is not yet full. This is a shocking, challenging statement. The kingdom
of heaven does not come by accident, or by those who are willing to just let it
come on its own time. It comes because men and women sacrifice their lives and
die for the gospel. It comes because many of our sisters and brothers over the
centuries have not counted their lives more precious than Christ, but have
counted the souls of the lost more valuable than their own comfort or short-term
physical existence. You and I are believers because of such men and women, who
have advanced the kingdom of God through the proclamation of the gospel to hard
places since the time of the&amp;nbsp;apostles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very least we can do for our brothers and sisters who are helping to fill up
that number is pray for them: for their ministry to be effective, for them to be
delivered from death, for them to remain faithful in the face of such harsh
persecution, and for their governments to cease thte oppression and the gospel
to go forth in power. So shall I remembere to do going forward, Lord&amp;nbsp;willing.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chris Krycho</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2014 23:55:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:www.chriskrycho.com,2014-02-14:2014/martyr-saints.html</guid><category>devotions</category></item><item><title>The Question and Its Answer</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/the-question-and-its-answer.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Here is the great mystery of our&amp;nbsp;faith:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I saw him, I fell at his feet as though dead. But he laid his right hand
on me, saying, &amp;#8220;Fear not, I am the first and the last, and the living one. I
died, and behold I am alive forevermore, and I have the keys of Death and
Hades.&amp;#8221; (Revelation&amp;nbsp;1:17&amp;#8211;18)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is the one who was before all, and he is and forever will be. And Jesus is
also the one who died. And Jesus is also the firstborn from the dead (Revelation
1:5)&amp;#8212;he who died now lives&amp;nbsp;again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Jesus said of another truth of our faith: with man, these things are
impossible, but with God, all things are&amp;nbsp;impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Revelation 3:11, Jesus said, &amp;#8220;I am coming soon.&amp;#8221; Now, some take this to mean
that the book is a lie; others take it to mean that Jesus came back in some
mystical way and will not return physically to reign on the earth. I take it to
mean that &amp;#8220;soon&amp;#8221; in the eyes of the Almighty who is first and last and reigns
forever and ever is not exactly the same as &amp;#8220;soon&amp;#8221; in the eyes of feeble humans
with our limited understanding. The Lord may return any day now&amp;#8212;and so it has
been these past twenty centuries. We wait expectantly, calling out in our hearts
(and sometimes with our lips as well) &amp;#8220;Lord, come soon!&amp;#8221; And in the interval,
this time between the times, we do our best to wait faithfully so that he does
not come like a thief and surprise us (Rev.&amp;nbsp;3:3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psalm 43 serves as another reminder that the Psalms are not some haphazard
collection. They were put together in the order they are for a reason. Psalms 42
and 43 are distinct, but they share a refrain and a common line. Whereas 42
functioned as a lament and stated the troubles facing the author, 43 turns and
asks justice of God. The contrast is helpful. There is a time simply to let God
know our sorrows and our frustrations, and then to instruct our souls to praise
him in the midst of those sorrows and frustrations. There is also a time to
plead with him to deliver us, and to instruct our souls to praise him as we wait
for that deliverance to come. Those may seem like small distinctions, but they
matter. We &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; they matter; else the Spirit-inspired editor of the Psalms
would not have placed these two here next to each other to contrast with each
other in this&amp;nbsp;way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading the final chapter of Ecclesiastes and the first chapters of Revelation
together is like reading the question and its answer all at once. Ecclesiastes
12 contains some of the most evocative language on the close of life and the
vanity of this-worldly existence to be found anywhere in all the literature of
all the world. It is a sad passage, meditating on the way all things fade away.
Revelation 1, on the other hand, is as clear a declaration that this world is
not all there is as anyone could ask. The eternal king of all rulers stands
forth to declare that he&amp;#8212;he who died and now lives again&amp;#8212;is coming soon and
will set the world aright, and those who trust in him will receive eternal
rewards and even reign alongside him. The world around us is fading, it is true,
but there will come a day when it is renewed, when all the things that faded
blossom again into gloriously new life. The Preacher could not see that day, but
that he longed to could not be clearer from the&amp;nbsp;text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So together with him we say, &amp;#8220;Lord, come&amp;nbsp;soon.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chris Krycho</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2014 23:10:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:www.chriskrycho.com,2014-02-13:2014/the-question-and-its-answer.html</guid><category>devotions</category></item><item><title>The God Who Is Near</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/the-god-who-is-near.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Psalm 42 comes in three parts: two statements of woe, and a refrain. It is an
interesting open to the second of five &amp;#8220;books&amp;#8221; that make up the Psalms, and the
first of the psalms of the sons of Korah. The Psalm includes many of the most
evocative images in the whole book, and many of those we quote most&amp;nbsp;often:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psalm&amp;nbsp;42:1:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;As a deer pants for flowing streams,
    so pants my soul fo ryou, O God.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psalm 42:5 (also 11, which repeeats&amp;nbsp;it):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Why are you cast down, O my soul,
    and why are you in turmoil within me?
Hope in God; for I shall again praise him,
    my salvation and my God.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psalm&amp;nbsp;42:7:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Deep calls to deep
    at the roar of your waterfalls;
all your breakers and  your waves
    have gone over me.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Psalm is true to life, evocative, and profoundly moving to me. So often we
confront a world in which it seems that all God&amp;#8217;s waves have gone over us. Yet
the Psalm teaches us both the right response to such circumstances (&amp;#8220;Hope in
God; for I shall again praise him&amp;#8221;) but also about who God is. As I have noted
before, the Psalms are not merely our response to God: they are also his
inspired revelation of&amp;nbsp;himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is the God upon whom we may call in such times. He is the one who &amp;#8220;commands
his steadfast love, and at night his song is with [us]&amp;#8221; (verse 7).  He is the
God of our lives (verse 7 again). He is the one who alone can quench the thirst
of our souls. It is his presence that will satisfy us, and nothing else. Being
removed from him is death to us, though we often forget it in the callousness of
life in a dead world (verses 1&amp;#8211;2). He is the God who made and owns the
waterfalls and the sea and all the lands (verses 6&amp;#8211;7). He is the God who calls
his people to go with glad shouts and songs of praise, keeping festival (verse
4). He is the God who knows our tears, even when it seems he does not, for he is
the God who has &lt;em&gt;shared&lt;/em&gt; our&amp;nbsp;tears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the author(s) of this Psalm, God&amp;#8217;s salvation remained far off in many ways.
For us, God&amp;#8217;s salvation has come, and we participate in him and partake of him.
It is not only that God has given us salvation; it is that God &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; our
salvation, and for us that salvation has become quite specific. He is Jesus, the
Messiah, the anointed king who does justice and righteousness and peace on the
earth. When the enemies of God&amp;#8217;s people taunt and say, &amp;#8220;Where is your God?&amp;#8221;
(verses 3, 10), and when our lives are filled with tears and mourning (verses 3,
9), we know where our God is. He is enthroned; and seated at the right hand of
that throne; and enthroned in our hearts. He is in all and through all and over
all. He is near to us, even in the times when he is silent and seems far&amp;nbsp;away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Why are you cast down, O my soul,
    and why are you in turmoil within me?
Hope in God; for I shall again praise him,
    my salvation and my God.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amen.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chris Krycho</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 12 Feb 2014 22:40:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:www.chriskrycho.com,2014-02-12:2014/the-god-who-is-near.html</guid><category>devotions</category></item><item><title>“God is Love”</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/god-is-love.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Description: God is love—but God is not corrupted human sentimentality. He is
holy, and his love and justice run hand in&amp;nbsp;hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our culture has a fixation on the idea that &amp;#8220;God is love.&amp;#8221; I remember a
conversation I had the first weekend I arrived at the University of Oklahoma,
most of a decade ago, in which I was discussing with others how God could
possibly be a God of love and yet still judge anyone. Likewise, I had another
conversation with a friend a few years later in which he argued that this
statement in 1 John was the central statement of the character of God. In both
cases (as in many others since), it seemed the idea was that this statement was
a trump card that overruled anything that contradicted the idea of love held by
those pointing to this&amp;nbsp;view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are of course many problems with the idea that &amp;#8220;God is love&amp;#8221; trumps
everything else in the Scriptures. First of all, it is not the only statement of
God&amp;#8217;s character. Quick to mind for anyone familiar with the scriptures are other
statements. Right here in the same book, we have &amp;#8220;God is light, and in him there
is no darkness at all&amp;#8221; (1 John 1:5). And of course we have passages throughout
the Bible reminding us emphatically that &amp;#8220;Holy, holy, holy is Yahweh Almighty&amp;#8221;
(see e.g. Isaiah 6:3). So yes, God &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; love&amp;#8230; and he &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; light, and he &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;
holy, and so on. Indeed, it is his holiness that comes on display throughout the
Scriptures most&amp;nbsp;often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there is another problem with the idea that God&amp;#8217;s love is somehow in tension
with historic Christian ideas about sin and the need of salvation. That problem
is the entire rest of the book of 1 John&amp;#8212;and for that matter, the rest of
&lt;em&gt;this verse&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who does not love does not know God, because God is love. In this the
love of God was made manifest among us, that God sent his only Son into the
world, so that we might live through him. In this is love, not that we have
loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our
sins. (1 John&amp;nbsp;4:8&amp;#8211;10)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God&amp;#8217;s love is not a mushy, sappy thing easily turned to overlook sins. It is the
kind of love that pursues reconciliation fiercly, and which does not brook
rejection lightly. It is the kind of love that dies on behalf of the beloved&amp;#8212;
but to what end? &lt;em&gt;To make propitiation for sins.&lt;/em&gt; Our sins needed to be
propitiated. So yes, God is love&amp;#8212;but God is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; corrupted human
sentimentality. The same author who wrote that God is love half a chapter later&amp;nbsp;says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoever does not believe God has made him a liar, because he has not believed
in the testimony that God has borne concerning his Son. And this is the
testimony, that God gave us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. Whoever
has the Son has life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life.
(1 John&amp;nbsp;5:10b&amp;#8211;12)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not the sort of thing that fits nicely in a hyper-&amp;#8220;tolerant&amp;#8221; view of the
world, in which no offense may be condemned (save perhaps condemnation). It is,
however, a beautiful and magnificent picture of a God who loves so fiercely he
would die to deal with his beloved&amp;#8217;s offense, though that offense be against
him. It is a picture of a God whose love does not conflict with his justice but
runs hand in hand with it. It is a picture of a Savior who laid down his life
for his sheep &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; who will not lightly see that salvation scorned. It is a
picture of a real God who really is reigning over all in wisdom and goodness&amp;#8212;
goodness that is not mere fondness or tolerance, but which passionately seeks
the good of the whole universe, including every man and&amp;nbsp;woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hallelujah. We have a great&amp;nbsp;God.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chris Krycho</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2014 22:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:www.chriskrycho.com,2014-02-11:2014/god-is-love.html</guid><category>devotions</category></item><item><title>Like His Brothers in Every Way</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/like-his-brothers-in-every-way.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Whether Jesus could have sinned or not is a question to tangle the mind. On the
one hand, we affirm that he was fully human, and this affirmation binds us to
affirm that he could indeed sin: all humans are capable of sinning, and apart
from Jesus, all humans &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; sinned. The author of Hebrews reminds us
forcefully that Jesus was made like his brothers&amp;#8212;which is to say, &lt;em&gt;us&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8212;in
every respect, being tempted like them, yet without sin. On the other hand, we
recognize that the Godhead is sinless and that, as James reminds us, he neither
tempts nor can be tempted with evil. As with many issues relating to the
Incarnation, we face the challenge of holding together both Jesus&amp;#8217; full deity
and his full humanity. When either is lost (or even simply diminished) in order
to emphasize or preserve the other, important aspects of our faith break in
serious&amp;nbsp;ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Difficult (mysterious even) the question may be, but the author of Hebrews
leaves little doubt. Jesus was tempted like us in &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; way&amp;#8212;not only in some
ways, but in every way. This is an essential affirmation for the Christian
faith. If Jesus could not sin, then he was not fully human, and his perfect life
is unsurprising and not particularly meaningful. If he &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; sin, then his
perfect life is extraordinary and especially&amp;nbsp;meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, we must integrate the things that Hebrews and James (and the
rest of the Scriptures) teach us. If the Godhead cannot be tempted by sin and
Jesus &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; tempted by sin, does this make Jesus somehow &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; God? No, for this
misses the rest of the witness of the New Testament, including those selfsame
books. James himself calls Jesus Lord in terms that, set against a Jewish
background, can only be understood to refer to God himself (see especially James
5:11, perhaps the most direct quote of Exodus 34:6 in the whole New Testament
and an unmistakable reference to Yahweh God). Neither can we admit the notion
that James and Hebrews disagree with each other&amp;#8212;at least, not and maintain our
affirmation of the unity of Scripture, which is a non-negotiable from where I&amp;nbsp;stand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with many things in the Trinity and the Incarnation, then, we are left making
a dual (and apparently conflicting affirmation). Jesus&amp;#8217; humanity was perfectly
capable of sinning, and his divinity was incapable of sinning. The Incarnation
holds the two together in a single person, and so we affirm that Jesus could
have sinned, but did not. We note, too, that he did not precisely because he did
as all humans are called to do (and what glorified humans &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; do) and
perfectly trusted the Father by obeying the Holy Spirit. Jesus&amp;#8217; perfect life was
not the domination of his humanity by his divinity, but the submission of his
humanity to the divinity of the&amp;nbsp;Trinity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus we affirm that Jesus&amp;#8217; not sinning on our behalf was a real moral victory,
not a hollow thing we can only look at bemusedly from afar. He lived as a real
second Adam, doing what the first Adam failed to do while beset by many more and
far greater temptations than the first Adam. He really did overcome the world&amp;#8212;
not only its powers, but its temptations. He really did demonstrate true and
perfect holiness that we might follow his example. He really did triumph over
every power of sin, that we might be transformed into his likeness. Though the
triune God is never tempted to sin, the triune God mysteriously partook of
everything it is to be human in the Incarnation, and that humanity &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be
tempted&amp;#8212;and he&amp;nbsp;overcame.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chris Krycho</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2014 08:30:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:www.chriskrycho.com,2014-02-11:2014/like-his-brothers-in-every-way.html</guid><category>M.&amp;hairsp;Div.</category></item><item><title>Joy Comes… After Pleading</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/joy-comes-after-pleading.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;In addition to the devotional reading I have been recording here, I have been
working through large stretches of the Old Testament in my second Old Testament
survey class, which covers everything after Job in your English Bible&amp;#8212;the
Psalms, the Wisdom literature, and all the Prophets. To cover all that ground in
a single semester requires moving quickly&amp;#8212;so quickly that I both skip over
details  I might otherwise be attentive to, and pick up on overarching themes I
might otherwise miss. This is particularly evident in the Psalms, and having
just gone through them at a high pace makes the flow and the context of each
individual Psalm more apparent as I come to them for the details again in my
ordinary devotional reading. Reading large chunks and then coming back through
the same section more slowly is such a helpful practice that I expect I shall
try to keep it&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming to Psalm 40, I am right in the middle of the Psalms of David&amp;#8212;a whole
stretch focusing on&lt;sup id="fnref:attr"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:attr" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; David&amp;#8217;s life and circumstances. Reading this
particular Psalm on its own is illuminating in its own ways, of course. It is
easy to come away with a sense of the joy of salvation from the exultant verses
here. The poem leaps from one triumphant note to another, rejoicing in how
Yahweh delivers his people and his anointed one. Hallelujah to&amp;nbsp;that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Psalm&amp;#8217;s meaning is much, much richer when situated in the broader context of
the book, though. When we turn back a single song and look at Psalm 39, we see
that not every moment is so rosy and joyful. As I noted in my &lt;a href="/2014
/with-confidence/"&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt;, the prayer in Psalm 39 is bold and leans hard on God&amp;#8212;
because David &lt;em&gt;needed&lt;/em&gt; God profoundly. He needed salvation from his sins; he
recognized the brevity of his own life and especially its fragility before the
almighty maker of heaven and earth;&lt;sup id="fnref:rm"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:rm" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; he knew that only Yahweh could
accomplish what he needed. The (Spirit-inspired!) editor of the Psalms took
these two poems on David&amp;#8217;s life and set them next to each other to teach us
something about the contours of a life devoted to Yahweh. Not every moment is
either sorrowful &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; rejoicing. More often, each one leads into the other as
the seasons of our life ebb and&amp;nbsp;flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This ebb and flow is &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;. We see the beauty of our salvation the more clearly
because it is set against the backdrop of our great need for salvation. All too
often, we recognize that need only because we have been forced to by our
circumstances&amp;#8212;by the travails of human life that range from parenting a
teething toddler to staring death full in its cancerous face (and we ought not
make little or too much of either, different scales though they be). We
sometimes find the joy of our salvation sweeter and more savory when we have
wrestled through the pain of loss and the wrestling with God that ensues. We
sometimes treasure God&amp;#8217;s answer more when has required us to wait for it&amp;#8212;to
wait for &lt;em&gt;him&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that every trial is aimed at this end. It is to say that the
contrast between Psalms 39 and 40 helps us see that &lt;em&gt;sometimes&lt;/em&gt; our trials work
out to deepen our joy in salvation. That in turn helps us hold on to God all the
more in the face of those trials, because it stands as one more picture of his
goodness and wisdom, and thus of his&amp;nbsp;trustworthiness.&lt;/p&gt;

         Her shields and banners ’blazoned not with martial sign

         The lamb which piercèd, bruised and bloodied, died

No stranger, prouder heraldry to march beneath
         But under it she conquers all, so waves she bold
    The lamb rampant! Dancing proud on trampled death
         On mort laid low by low-laid, somehow mortal God

Come and rest! she calls— Come and heal! Ev’ry traitor

They show us how we ought
to approach God, and teach us who God is. Psalm 39 is no exception: it does
both, through and through. David opens the Psalm by expressing a sentiment we
have all shared at some time or another: holding our tongue around those who are
actively causing us grief or harm, lest we sin, and finally coming to a point
when we can hold back our frustration no longer. Unlike my typical response,
though, David did not lash out at those who frustrated him. As is typical of the
response the Psalms record, David turned instead to God. It is a striking&amp;nbsp;turn:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;As I mused, the fire burned
    then I spoke with my tongue:
O Yahweh…
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the Psalm is addressed not to David&amp;#8217;s enemies (mentioned in verse 1)
as a rebuke, but to the one who can deliver him from those enemies and from his
own sin. It is not a quiet, passive Psalm, but a loud and forceful request
(though not, notably, a demand) that Yahweh be gracious and deliver David from
his own transgressions. There is acknowledgement, to be sure, of fault, but also
bold importuning of the sovereign God of the universe to act in a certain way in
David&amp;#8217;s life &lt;em&gt;when David had sinned&lt;/em&gt;. Even to those of us who stand on this side
of the cross&amp;#8212;we who are enjoined to come confidently before the throne of
grace (Hebrews 4:16)&amp;#8212;this kind of boldness is a bit&amp;nbsp;shocking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Psalms are full of this kind of thing&amp;#8212;and frankly, it tends to make most
of us uncomfortable. The idea that we could thus address God seems out of line
or inappropriate. It seems remarkably bold to say to God, &amp;#8220;Hear my prayer, O
&lt;span class='smcp'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, / and give ear to my cry; / hold not your peace
at my tears!&amp;#8221; More: it seems on the verge of untrusting, not to recognize that
God always has his right and wise reasons for acting as he does and allowing
(even ordaining) the things we experience. David has no qualms about this,
though; in fact, it typifies the way he and the other Psalmists address God in
the midst of&amp;nbsp;trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder if perhaps we struggle with these kinds of prayers precisely because
&lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; do not know or trust God as we ought. (And that we? It points mostly at me
here.) David could come beseech God to be merciful and kind to him by delivering
him from his own sin because he knew God to be merciful and gracious. He could
plead boldly with God because he knew that God is both all-good and all-wise,
and that God&amp;#8217;s answer would be &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt;. In short, he could come boldly before
the throne of Yahweh Almighty because he &lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt; Yahweh Almighty. How much more
can we who have seen Yahweh&amp;#8217;s mercy writ large in the grotesque humiliations of
the incarnation, death, and resurrection of Jesus be confident in his goodness
and wisdom and mercy toward us? When we see our own sin, and when we taste
discipline for that sin, are we able to go to our Father in heaven and plead for
deliverance from our own folly with this kind of&amp;nbsp;confidence?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If not, it is only because we do not know him or trust him as we&amp;nbsp;ought.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chris Krycho</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 08 Feb 2014 23:27:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:www.chriskrycho.com,2014-02-08:2014/with-confidence.html</guid><category>devotions</category></item><item><title>Imperatives and Indicatives</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/imperatives-and-indicatives.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Paul&amp;#8217;s typical format for his letters is to lay out a series of doctrinal
statements in the first half of the epistle and then follow it up with a series
of exhortations flowing out of those truths in the second half. This is not a
hard rule with him. He has letters like 1 and 2 Corinthians in which the content
moves back and forth more freely between the two kinds of material, and he also
mixes imperatives in with indicatives and vice versa in all his letters. On the
whole, though Colossians follows this pattern fairly closely: chapter 1 and the
first part of chapter 2 are statements of theological truth (and among the
highest and weightiest such in Scripture), and the rest of the book moves into
the Christian response to these&amp;nbsp;truths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a mere 44 verses (fewer if one leaves out the introduction), Paul traverses
enormous depths of theology. Christ is the author of Creation, the one in whom
all things hold together. He is before all things. He is the head of the church.
He is the image of the invisible God. He is the heir (&amp;#8220;firstborn&amp;#8221;) of creation;
it belongs to him in its entirety. He is the firstborn (and heir) of the
resurrection from the&amp;nbsp;dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is no surprise, then, that the consequences range over all aspects of human
life. There is nothing that goes untouched: not our family life, nor our
economic behavior, nor our religious activity, nor our thoughts or actions in
any area. Paul enjoined the Colossians to set aside all &amp;#8220;sexual immorality,
impurity, passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry&amp;#8230;. anger,
wrath, malice, slander, and obscene talk from your mouth&amp;#8221; (Colossians 3:5,8). As
Abraham Kuyper put it of culture, there is no part of life over which Christ
does not shout, &amp;#8220;Mine!&amp;#8221; So it is in our lives as well: we are his wholly and
utterly, fight it though we often do at times. We may foolishly cling to our
sins, or we may seek to be sanctified in every area of our&amp;nbsp;lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note well the constant return to the foundational truths on which that call to
holiness is built. Paul not only lays out these exhortations as following the
indication of all Christ has already done, but points again and again to the
reality that sanctifiaction can happen only as we are joined with Christ. We
died with Christ (2:20) and have been raised with Christ (3:1). He is our life
(3:4) and our life is hidden with God in Christ (3:3). Christ is all, and in all
(3:11). His peace rules in our hearts (3:15); his word dwells in us richly in
the context of song and psalm&amp;nbsp;(3:16).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are not small things, or light matters. These are magnificent and holy,
and they call us to be holy likewise. God is very great&amp;#8212;very far beyond us&amp;#8212;
but he draws us near in his loving kindness and calls us out of our selfishness
and sin and into his holy ways.&amp;nbsp;Hallelujah.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chris Krycho</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 07 Feb 2014 21:30:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:www.chriskrycho.com,2014-02-07:2014/imperatives-and-indicatives.html</guid><category>devotions</category></item><item><title>The Wicked Perish</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/the-wicked-perish.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;It is apparent to me that one of the reasons I sometimes struggle with passages
speaking of God&amp;#8217;s judgment on the wicked is because I do not face persecution or
active hostility from those who hate God. I might get called names or insulted
occasionally (though only occasionally), but I have never been at risk of loss
of property, much less of health or life, because I follow Christ. Believers in
other places and other times are not so at ease among those who do not follow
God. For those who are not so at ease, the prosperity and success of those who
oppress them are much larger concerns&amp;#8212;much nearer to home, and much more
urgently in need of&amp;nbsp;justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, in both of Paul&amp;#8217;s letters to the Thessalonians, he encourages them to
remain steadfast in part by pointing to God&amp;#8217;s future judgment on the enemies of
Christ. He points them to the future return of Jesus not to remove the believers
from this world, but to judge those who reject God and to rule in righteousness
over the world. That is a cause for rejoicing for believers: all of us want to
see the world put right, with an end to poverty and war, cancer and rape,
tornadoes and abortion, Alzheimers and murder, oppression and death. Nearly
&lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; wants this kind of world, in theory. But in practice, we are either
children of God or people who &amp;#8220;refused to love the truth and so be saved&amp;#8221; (2
Thessalonians 2:10). And those who refuse to love the truth and be saved oppress
and murder the people of God (and everyone else, but &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; the people of&amp;nbsp;God).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our fellow believers in Saudi Arabia and Iran and North Korea are not reading
these passages of judgment and wondering how God could judge so harshly. They
are reading them and holding fast to the hope that this day will come &lt;em&gt;soon&lt;/em&gt;,
when those who grind underfoot the poor, the widow, and the orphan, who throw
Jesus&amp;#8217; followers in jail and execute their pastors, will get justice at the
hands of God. Many of our fellow believers look forward to the day when &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt;
will get justice from God, because in this present life injustice has often been
their&amp;nbsp;lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;In just a little while, the wicked will be no more;
    though you look carefully at his place, he will not be there.
But the meek shall inherit the land
    and delight themselves in abundant peace.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This points me forward in several ways. First, it reminds me that this is an
area in which I need to be sanctified. Contrary to everything the surrounding
world says, a lack of judgment on the part of God would be grotesquely
unrighteous. We can see this clearly in the most egregious cases: none of us
think it would be right for Charles Manson or Stalin to get off without
punishment. But God&amp;#8217;s justice is deeper than ours, and truer, and that is
&lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;. Lord willing, I will come to understand more and more the goodness of
his doing justice and righteousness on the earth, not least as I understand that
his &lt;em&gt;shalom&lt;/em&gt; will not come&amp;#8212;could not come&amp;#8212;apart from his doing justice. And
his doing justice means crushing&amp;nbsp;evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, it reminds me (again) that we Westerners, much though we have to offer
to our brothers and sisters around the world, also have much to learn from them.
The persecuted church is not so easily led astray in this area as we in our
comfort are. Likewise, we have much to learn from those who have gone before us.
Whatever their faults, many of our forebears in the faith got &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; right where
we get it wrong. We would do well to listen more humbly to our fellow saints of
every age and every tribe&amp;#8212;and not to arrogate to ourselves the right to judge
God&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, it reminds me to pray for God to work his justice in the world: to
deliver suffering saints in lands hostile to the gospel, and to end the
oppression of the wicked either by saving them from their sins or by ruining
them. This is not a comfortable prayer, but it is a good and right prayer. It
reminds me, too, to pray all the more fervently: &amp;#8220;Lord, come&amp;nbsp;soon!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chris Krycho</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 06 Feb 2014 22:41:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:www.chriskrycho.com,2014-02-06:2014/the-wicked-perish.html</guid><category>devotions</category></item><item><title>Big Enough for Mystery</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/big-enough-for-mystery.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Ecclesiastes is challenging book, to be sure. Like the rest of the Scriptures,
though, it does yield its treasures as we seek the face of God there.
Remembering that Scripture is the self-revelation of one who wants to be known
helps us situate the hard passages and find their meaning. We are not left
wandering in the dark; we can see God here. This is no less true of the pages of
Zechariah than of the letters of Paul. The latter, it is true, may be more
direct and explicit&amp;#8212;but the fact that Ecclesiastes gets at the character of
God sideways, as it were, tells us something about God. It tells us that not
everything about him can be learned from looking straight on, from direct&amp;nbsp;propositions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it is only in travail, in the &amp;#8220;dark night of the soul&amp;#8221; that we learn
who our Maker really is. Sometimes it is only in poetry. Sometimes it is when
the pursuit of wisdom turns to folly that we learn that wisdom is not some
reified artifact to be apprehended, but a living person who is always Other and&amp;nbsp;Above&amp;#8212;Holy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solomon went running after every kind of good in this world and for answers to
all his questions. The more he searched, the more he gained, the more lost he
was and the more he lost. The problem was not seeking the goods of this world,
nor in seeking answers to questions. It was partly in seeking them where they
could never be found, and partly in failing to be silent before the face of God
who has not chosen to answer every question, and partly in succumbing to the
notion that the depths of reality can be plumbed. Some things are forever out of
our grasp; some knowledge is always too high for&amp;nbsp;us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That does not mean we ought not seek after wisdom. It means we ought to seek
Wisdom himself, to go after the one who has become to us wisdom from God along
with righteousness and peace. It means we ought to revel in what can be known,
and revel too where God says, &amp;#8220;This is mystery. Trust me.&amp;#8221; The world is big
enough for mystery. Humans, too, are big enough for mystery. Too often we shrink
ourselves down, shrink down the world around us, shrink down God himself, so
that we may all fit in conveniently sized packages with regular shapes. But God
is always bursting out of our bounds, surprising us with his fierce love and his
sharply tender&amp;nbsp;grace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solomon&amp;#8217;s conclusion in chapter 5&amp;#8212;like the conclusion to which he eventually
comes in the end of the book&amp;#8212;is simpler than we might expect, given the
travails of his&amp;nbsp;heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behold, what I have seen to be good and fitting is to eat and drink and find
enjoyment in all the toil with which one toils under the sun the few days of
his life that God has given him, for this is his lot. Everyone also to whom
God has given wealth and possessions and power to enjoy them, and to accept
his lot and rejoice in his toil—this is the gift of God. For he will not much
remember the days of his life because God keeps him occupied with joy in his
heart. (Ecclesiastes&amp;nbsp;5:18&amp;#8211;20)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small things, these: to eat and drink and find enjoyment in all our toil. Or
perhaps not so small, when we look at them again. For Solomon has already told
us that these are vanity when not given and received as gifts from God. They
will not satisfy. They are just wind and emptiness. But then God fills them up,
and they are suddenly good. God brings joy in these simple things. Is this not
what all of us desire? Is it not what Solomon chased and failed to find (the
confession of the preceding and following chapters of the book)? Is it not the
original promise of the world: to work it and enjoy the fruit of one&amp;#8217;s labor as
a gift from God&amp;#8217;s hand? No, these are not small things. They are very great. And
they come from God, with joy.&amp;nbsp;Hallelujah.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chris Krycho</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 05 Feb 2014 22:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:www.chriskrycho.com,2014-02-05:2014/big-enough-for-mystery.html</guid><category>devotions</category></item><item><title>The Mother of God</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/the-mother-of-god.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Is it right to call Mary the Mother of God? The historic, orthodox answer is a
resounding &amp;#8220;yes&amp;#8221;&amp;#8212;though a clearly qualified and well articulated &amp;#8220;yes.&amp;#8221; This
is not just the historic, orthodox position; it is the &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; position. Mary
was indeed the &amp;#8220;mother of God&amp;#8221;. She was the mother of Jesus. Jesus was (and is)
fully God &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; fully man, completely and truly, both at once without loss of
the full measure of either. He did not cease being totally divine upon his
incarnation, but he did assume full humanity. The argument is as simple as it
first seems: Mary is the mother of Jesus, and Jesus is God, therefore Mary is
the mother of&amp;nbsp;God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evangelicals tend to shy away from following the broader tradition and affirming
that Mary is the mother of God. There are many reasons for this, not least our
general discomfort with things having to do with Mary born of the over-
referencing of Mary in the Catholic tradition and the actual Mariolatry that is
too often evinced in Catholic lay practice throughout the world. However, our
response ought not be to reject this view, but to speak carefully and clearly
and reject what is mistaken while keeping what is&amp;nbsp;true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is true that we must be nuanced in our handling of this issue. The word
&amp;#8220;mother&amp;#8221; brings with it implications that we must avoid, and we must remember
Jesus&amp;#8217; statements on what it meant to be his mother and brothers and sisters in
the gospels (i.e. that those who followed him were those really deserving of the
titles). However, simply to set aside the title is to lose important aspects of
the reality of the incarnation. If we say that Mary was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the mother of God,
we are really saying either that she was not truly the mother of Jesus, or that
Jesus was not fully God. Neither of these is a tolerable&amp;nbsp;option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, to those qualifications. When we say that Mary is the mother of God, we are
not saying that God in any sense has his source in her. All of the humanity of
Jesus finds its source equally in Mary and in the Spirit&amp;#8217;s divine intervention
&amp;#8212;but Mary was created by the Son, rather than the Son originating in her. Mary
is the mother of God in Christ, but she is not to the Son exactly as ordinary
mothers are to ordinary sons, for Jesus was not an ordinary&amp;nbsp;son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nor do we mean that Mary has special prerogatives because of her relationship to
Jesus. As noted above, Jesus made clear that he was concerned above all with
obedience to the will of God (see e.g. Matthew 12:46&amp;#8211;50). Thus, the devotions
offered to Mary by our Catholic and Eastern Orthodox brothers and sisters is
misplaced, as is the notion that her prayers are somehow more effective in
touching Jesus&amp;#8217; heart than are those of the ordinary saint who is seeking to
honor&amp;nbsp;God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These qualifications notwithstanding, we must still be willing and ready to
affirm that Mary was in fact the Mother of God. To do otherwise is to reduce in
one way or another the mystery of the incarnation. It is not so much that &lt;em&gt;Mary&lt;/em&gt;
is important here as that affirming her motherhood of God helps us affirm the
important points to which we must hold fast in terms the full deity and full
humanity of &lt;em&gt;Christ&lt;/em&gt;. Mary is important because Jesus humanity came by means of
Mary&amp;#8217;s body. Everything that it is to be man, Jesus always was from conception,
and everything that it is to be God, Jesus always was from the moment of his&amp;nbsp;conception.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chris Krycho</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 04 Feb 2014 08:30:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:www.chriskrycho.com,2014-02-04:2014/the-mother-of-god.html</guid><category>M.&amp;hairsp;Div.</category></item><item><title>Resolved to Pray</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/resolved-to-pray.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Paul&amp;#8217;s letters all open with a common pattern: he gives the typical introduction
of his era with his own name and those of his co-authors, and then proceeds to
explain how he prays for the people to whom he is writing. I read once of
someone who went through and looked at all the things Paul prays for people in
his epistles and used those as a basis for his own prayers for others. That
seems a remarkably good idea to me. Paul&amp;#8217;s heart for each and every church to
which he ministered is readily&amp;nbsp;apparent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope and pray that as I step more and more into ministry, my own heart would
be so dedicated to the good of those whom I serve, and that I would be so
faithful as Paul was to pray regularly for them. I have a long way to go in
this; I do not pray as much even for my own family and friends as I would like.
Jaimie and I have made prayer a regular part of our lives by sitting down as a
family together to pray every night before we put Elayne to bed, and I pray at
times throughout the day. These are good things. I am glad we have taken these
steps to make prayer a regular part of our lives. Even so, I am much less
dedicated and disciplined in prayer than many I know and especially than the
many heroes of the faith who distinguished themselves in large part through the
faithfulness of their prayers and their trust that God would&amp;nbsp;answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The content of Paul&amp;#8217;s prayers is just as important as their frequency, though.
Reading 1 Thessalonians 1 reminded me of the &lt;em&gt;kinds&lt;/em&gt; of things I ought to be
praying, as well as &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; I ought to be praying. In this particular
introduction, Paul is above all grateful to God for the Thessalonians&amp;#8217; &amp;#8220;work of
faith  and labor of love and steadfastness of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ.&amp;#8221;
This faithfulness before God resounded throughout the early church; these
believers had a reputation for their perseverance in the face of persecution and
their love of God. What a thing to start praying for the believers I know, and
especially for my church and the missionaries we have sent out: that we would be
known for our faith, love, and steadfast hope in Jesus Christ; that we would
persevere in the face of challenges to our faith and even outright persecution;
that the testimony of our deeds would go forth and be an encouragement to the
rest of the&amp;nbsp;Church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resolved, then: to pray more faithfully for my fellow saints, first of all at
First Baptist Church of Durham and then in the other churches I know and love
and then throughout the world as I hear of them; and to pray more thoughtfully
and wisely for God to make of us all the kinds of people over whom Paul was
rejoicing in these early verses of this letter.&amp;nbsp;Amen.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chris Krycho</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 04 Feb 2014 07:40:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:www.chriskrycho.com,2014-02-04:2014/resolved-to-pray.html</guid><category>devotions</category></item><item><title>The Horror of Sin</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/the-horror-of-sin.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Matthew 26:3&amp;#8211;7 contains one of the most horrifying illustrations of human
depravity anywhere in the Bible. It is such a simple passage, but the human
wickedness on display is profound. The scene is this: Jesus has already been
condemned by the Jews. Judas&amp;#8212;expecting &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; other outcome than Jesus&amp;#8217; death,
or simply turned back from the plan to which he had previously agreed&amp;#8212;comes,
seeking to make right what he had done wrong. The priests respond by rejecting
him, and he throws the money down on the floor before he goes and hangs&amp;nbsp;himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The priests then note that it would be &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt; to put the money in the temple
treasury, since it was after all blood money. Here these men were, having just
plotted the death of a man they knew to be innocent, a man they could condemn
only on trumped up charges after a farce of a trail, worried about whether they
should put a few pieces of silver in the treasury or not. Their conclusion, that
the money could not be used for the temple because it was &amp;#8220;blood money&amp;#8221;, still
did not make them realize the horror of their sin&amp;#8212;that they had bought a man&amp;#8217;s
life! That they should do this with &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; man is a horror; that they would do it
with their long-awaited Messiah, the incarnate Son of God, is a horror beyond
words. That they could not see the disjunction between their scruples about
where the money was used and the very reason they had the money should put the
fear of sin in us&amp;nbsp;all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is human depravity. We can look our sin square in the face and not see it
for what it is sometimes. We become inured to its power and its hold on us. We
think we can just deal with it in some way or another&amp;#8212;and we are profoundly
wrong. We cannot deal with our sin apart from the saving work of Chris ton our
behalf. We cannot even see it clearly without the illuminating power of the Holy
Spirit. No divine intervention means no holiness on our part; without the work
of God we would remain forever trapped in the darkness that shrouds our eyes
from seeing our sin aright and from seeing our great and awesome God as he&amp;nbsp;is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet this is also the hand of God at work. So often God takes what men meant for
evil and works it for good. Often we cannot see his means &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; his ends, but we
know from the gospels that the greatest evil ever perpetrated by men&amp;#8212;the only
innocent man dead at the hands of hardenered human hearts&amp;#8212;was used of God to
accomplish the greatest good ever provided to men. This lets us trust that God
is likewise at work in our own lives. We know that he is all-wise and all-good.
We do not know what he aims to accomplish with every act (nor indeed with many
of his acts), but we know that those aims will be for the good of all those who
love him and (most importantly) are loved by&amp;nbsp;him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hallelujah.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chris Krycho</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 03 Feb 2014 22:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:www.chriskrycho.com,2014-02-03:2014/the-horror-of-sin.html</guid><category>devotions</category></item><item><title>Vanity! Vanity!</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/vanity-vanity.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Ecclesiastes is one of the most interpretively challenging books in the whole
Bible. &lt;a href="/2014/ordinary-means-the-silence-of-god/"&gt;Like Esther&lt;/a&gt;, its inclusion in
the canon was much debated. Unlike Esther, the book mentions God plenty&amp;#8212;but
its approach to theology is challenging, to say the least. The author, generally
understood to be Solomon, is not exactly a cheerful fellow and is his approach
to life can be summed up in the single word that is the refrain of the whole
book:&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;Vanity!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chapter 2 gives us this bleak outlook applied to pleasure and possessions on the
one hand and vocation on the other. In both cases, the Preacher (Heb.
&lt;em&gt;qoheleth&lt;/em&gt;) comes to the same conclusion: &amp;#8220;Then I considered all tha tmy hands
had done and the toil I had expended in doing it, and behold, all was vanity and
a striving after wind, and there was nothing to be gained under the sun&amp;#8221;
(Ecclesiastes 2:11). This is so bleak as to border on despair, and therefore no
few Christians of my acquaintance find the book difficult to integrate with
their&amp;nbsp;theology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem, as near as I can tell, is one of genre.&lt;sup id="fnref:genre"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:genre" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Ecclesiastes is
wisdom literature, and it serves as an extended meditation on the world that
Solomon found around him. And taken without the context of redemptive history,
Solomon&amp;#8217;s proclamation that everything is vanity is perfectly accurate. Life is
a grind. We cannot keep the things we earn or buy, no matter how magnificent. If
we are perfectly wise in our dealings, we will nonetheless die and leave
everything we have to others, and who knows whether they will be geniuses,
mediocrities, or idiots? We can have a thousand pleasures at our command, and we
will find them all unsatisfactory in the end. We can work hard, and have nothing
to show for it when we return to&amp;nbsp;dust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But all these things are observations of the world as it is&amp;#8212;not statements on
what it ought to be. It is easy to mistake description for prescription. The
Preacher never suggests that life in this world &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be mere vanity. To the
contrary: the very fact that he was asking the questions he asked is indicative
of the real shape of reality. We all ask the same questions with him at some
point or another: Does my work matter? Would I be satisfied if I had every
material thing I could desire? Would having (functionally) infinite sexual
choice&lt;sup id="fnref:sex"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:sex" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; bring me contentment? Solomon discovered the answer:&amp;nbsp;no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there we leave it, for chapter 2. But my other reading tonight was in
Matthew and in Psalms, and they do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; leave it there. Psalm 33 points us to
the ways that Yahweh works justice in the world and calls us to rejoice in him,
not in the things of this age. Matthew 22&amp;#8211;25 reminds us that the kingdom of
heaven is &lt;em&gt;coming&lt;/em&gt;; it is not here yet. The age to come will be so &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; much
better than this one. No more will our existence be nothing but vanity.&amp;nbsp;Hallelujah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am looking forward to seeing this covered in my Old Testament &lt;span class="caps"&gt;II&lt;/span&gt;
class this semester, as I suspect that the coverage there will prove
illuminating. It certainly was helpful for my grasp of Job!&amp;#8212;but  more on that
another time.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:genre" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about the fact that Solomon is reported to have had some 1,000
wives and concubines (see 1 Kings 11:3). This may not be infinite in the
strictest sense of the word&amp;#8230; but it is close enough.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:sex" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

to sin that the actual act is inevitable has been a much debated topic for
generations. In my view, however, the question is impossible to answer. I do not
think Scripture speaks with sufficient clarity on the matter. We know on the one
hand that all are &amp;#8220;by nature children of wrath&amp;#8221; (Ephesians 2:3), and that &amp;#8220;all
have sinned and fall short of the glory of God&amp;#8221; (Romans 3:23). What neither of
these texts tell us, though, and what indeed &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; text tells us, is whether
people are guilty at birth or whether they are simply sinful and become&amp;nbsp;guilty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could reason to a conclusion that accords with our other theological
commitments with little difficulty. We know that God is just, and punishes for
the wrongs we commit, but we have no evidence that he punishes wrongs we &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt;
commit, and therefore we might conclude that he would therefore not find guilty
any newly conceived or newly born person. On the other hand, we also must reckon
with the reality that the Scriptures treat questions of progeny far differently
than do individually-minded modern&amp;nbsp;Westerners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scripture points us to the God who &amp;#8220;will by no means clear the guilty, visiting
the iniquity of the fathers on the children and the children&amp;#8217;s children, to the
third and the fourth generation&amp;#8221; (Exodus 34:7) as well as the God who proclaims
that &amp;#8220;The soul who sins shall die. The son shall not suffer for the iniquity of
the father, nor the father suffer for the iniquity of the son&amp;#8221; (Ezekiel 18:20).
Paul did write that &amp;#8220;one trespass led to condemnation for all men,&amp;#8221; but he
immediately follows up this provocative statement by arguing that &amp;#8220;one act of
righteousness leads to justification and life for all men&amp;#8221; (Romans 5:18)&amp;#8212;yet
we know that Paul does not (and cannot) here mean that all men are saved, for we
know that he believes that those who do not repent and believe the gospel perish
in their sins under the expectation of&amp;nbsp;judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We cannot from the evidence that God has given us decide this question. We are
left without an answer. If we grant the sufficiency of Scripture, then we must
recognize that if there are questions God has in his wisdom opted not to answer,
it is for a reason, and we should cease with our speculations and be silent. We
may not know whether infants are &lt;em&gt;guilty&lt;/em&gt;, but we do know two other things that
are far more important than that: First, God is merciful and gracious and just.
We will not in the final reckoning find his justice lacking or his treatment of
(for example) those who died in infancy to be lacking. Second, all are born
under the dual curse of sin&amp;#8217;s hold and death&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;certainty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These truths give us clear and straightforward points of application. First, we
must preach the gospel clearly to people of every age and intellectual ability,
for even little children sin and death is awaiting us all. Whether or not we are
born guilty, we &lt;em&gt;become&lt;/em&gt; guilty very quickly. Second, much of the speculation on
this question&amp;#8212;and many churches practices such as infant baptism&amp;#8212;seems to be
rooted in worry about the fate of those who die young, without having made a
credible profession of faith. Yet even if we &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; know the answer to the
question of their guilt, we still might not know God&amp;#8217;s response. Even did we
know the answer, still we would need learn to trust in the goodness and wisdom
of God in this&amp;nbsp;matter.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chris Krycho</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2014 08:30:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:www.chriskrycho.com,2014-02-01:2014/infant-guilt-purest-speculation.html</guid><category>M.&amp;hairsp;Div.</category></item><item><title>Not Simple</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/not-simple.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, I hate the heading markers in my Bible. While they can be helpful for
some people at some times, I find more and more that they simply distract. They
make it difficult to see&amp;#8212;or to remember&amp;#8212;that the books are &lt;em&gt;books&lt;/em&gt;. Nowhere
is this more distracting than in the gospels. The gospels are coherent books.
They are not mere collections of stories, arranged haphazardly or tossed
together willy-nilly; the authors had a point and purpose in what they were
doing, and that point and purpose is hard to see for the constant interruptions
in the text. These interruptions, not present in the original, mask the way the
pieces fit together&amp;#8212;and they mask the surprising ways they do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; obviously
fit together,&amp;nbsp;too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because these are the kinds of questions we should be asking as we read through
the book: Why does Matthew transition from Jesus&amp;#8217; rather shocking encounter with
his family&amp;#8212;the one where he proclaims that his disciples are his family in a
way that his biological family is not&amp;#8212;to the death of John the Baptist? And
why from there to the feeding of the five thousand? And why thence to
interactions with the scribes and Pharisees? He is going somewhere with this
narrative; where? What does he want us to&amp;nbsp;see?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In John 14, Jesus leaves the crowds behinds to seek respite on hearing of the
death of his cousin and fellow servant of Yahweh, John the Baptizer. But then a
crowd finds him, and he has compassion on them; he goes out of his way to care
for them. Then, a few hundred words later, he compares a Canaanite woman to a
dog, using the racially charged language of the Jews. (This should shock the
reader, given how Matthew has already had Jesus praise outsiders and proclaim
that the kingdom will be composed of those who were far off as well as of those
who were near.) But then he blesses her for her faith. Then Matthew follows this
story with another case of his feeding a multitude because of his compassion for
them. Scattered through all these narratives are his interactions with the
Pharisees, whom he repeatedly criticizes in the harshest&amp;nbsp;terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why these particular stories? Why these particular&amp;nbsp;contrasts?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it is because Matthew aims to confound his readers in precisely the ways
the disciples (Matthew himself included) were confounded. We see that they were
often confused. We see that they failed to understand who he was, and then even
as they began to grasp that he was the Messiah (14:32, 16:16), they continued to
misunderstand what he was about. His teachings confused them, and they had to
learn over and over again the same lessons. Matthew has structured his narrative
so that the reader is faced with the same kinds of confounding contrasts that
the disciples faced. We, too, must wrestle with this Son of Man who both
overflows with compassion on the crowds and repeatedly evinces his frustration
with the faithlessness of the people. We, too, must come to terms with a king
who planned from the first to die rather than than to conquer. We, too, must
read the riddles rightly&amp;#8212;and marvel though we do at the disciples who did not
understand his parables, if we are honest we must admit how we struggle to
interpret them&amp;nbsp;ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is not simple. He never was. We too often try to fit him into a neat box:
the social revolutionary, or the the compsassionate healer, or the righteous
firebrand, or the gentle savior. Take your pick, according to your social and
political preferences. But he will not be so boxed in. He is all of these and
more, and he is none of these insofar as none of them circumscribe him. He is
righteousness and justice and peace&lt;sup id="fnref:rjs"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:rjs" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;#8212;which means that he thunders forth
judgment, and he tenderly comforts those in need. It means that he offers sharp
edges and delighted praise to the same people. It means that he marveled at the
faith and the faithlessness of people whose hearts he knew before they spoke. It
means that he is a mystery even as he reveals himself plainly. It means that he
cannot be comprehended, but invites us to know&amp;nbsp;him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A trio I borrowed from J. Clinton McCann Jr.&amp;#8217;s description of Yahweh&amp;#8217;s
&amp;#8220;anointed one&amp;#8221; (that is, &amp;#8220;messiah&amp;#8221;) in the Psalms. See Chapter 12: Hearing the
Psalter in &lt;cite&gt;Hearing the Old Testament&lt;/cite&gt;, eds. Craig G. Bartholomew &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chris Krycho</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 31 Jan 2014 20:55:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:www.chriskrycho.com,2014-01-31:2014/not-simple.html</guid><category>devotions</category></item><item><title>Basic Human Folly</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/basic-human-folly.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Psalm 30 stands as one of the most evocative pictures of our human propensity
for self-congratulatory folly in all of Scripture. It is a splendid poetic
demonstration of an arc we have all traced out. David opens the Psalm by telling
us where he is going. The first two stanzas declare that Yahweh saves and
enjoins his saints to praise him, &amp;#8220;For his anger is but for a moemnt,  / and his
favor is for a lifetime. / Weeping may tarry for the night, / but joy comes with
the morning&amp;#8221; (Psalm&amp;nbsp;30:5).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then David tells us how he got there. I cannot do better in summing up the third
stanza than simply quoting&amp;nbsp;it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;As for me, I said in my prosperity,
    "I shall never be moved."
By your favor, O &amp;lt;span class='smcp'&amp;gt;Lord&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;,
    you made my mountain stand strong;
you hid your face;
    I was dismayed.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of the most basic human follies. As God cares for us and provides
for us, we take credit for it ourselves. But it was &lt;em&gt;Yahweh&lt;/em&gt; who made David&amp;#8217;s
&amp;#8220;mountain stand strong&amp;#8221;&amp;#8212;not David. The moment Yahweh took away his presence,
David was in ruin. How often do we all fall prey to exactly this sort of
nonsense? How often do I trust in my own capabilities or my own wisdom, and
credit my own hard work and talents for where I stand in life? Certainly, I am
too clever to do so openly, even to myself: I know that I should not be resting
on my own merits. But deep down, we all make that dreadful move&amp;nbsp;sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other significant point of interest in this third stanza is what it was that
dismayed David. He does not emphasize here whatever external consequences he may
have experienced in his pride (though the next stanza suggests that there were
some). Rather, he points to the Yahweh&amp;#8217;s withdrawal of his presence: &amp;#8220;you hid
your face&amp;#8221; (Psalm 30:7b) as the basis for his dismay. Would that I were so
sensitive to God that I recognized his presence as far more important than any
other situational reality. We are offered the privilege of fellowship with the
divine, and so often we&amp;#8212;so often &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8212;turn away from it for other, lesser
things. So often, we are more frustrated by the difficulties of our trials than
we are by a lack of relationship with our heavenly Father. David has the right
of it,&amp;nbsp;though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is much that could be said of the fourth stanza on questions of
theological development, Old Testament understandings of death, and so on. More
interesting to me&amp;#8212;in a devotional context, at least!&amp;#8212;is the point of the
stanza: a simple plea for help from Yahweh. Again, David&amp;#8217;s response is a model
for us. When faced with the removal of God&amp;#8217;s presence and the looming
consequences, he prayed for salvation. The result, coming in the fifth and final
stanza, is the restoration of David&amp;#8217;s state. Yahweh moved him from the ritual
death of lament (&amp;#8220;mourning&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;sackloth&amp;#8221;) to ritual life (&amp;#8220;dancing&amp;#8221; and
&amp;#8220;gladness&amp;#8221;).&lt;sup id="fnref:ritual"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:ritual" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Importantly, David does not make again the mistake that
took him down this road in the first place. He recognizes that Yahweh had
restored him for a&amp;nbsp;reason:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;that my glory may sing your praise and be not silent,
    O &amp;lt;span class=smcp&amp;gt;Lord&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; my God, I will give thanks to you forever!
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His &amp;#8220;glory&amp;#8221;&amp;#8212;his mountain standing strong&amp;#8212;was not for his own pleasure, but
for the honor of the one who made him stand&amp;nbsp;strong.&lt;/p&gt;

dialectic of law and gospel that every moral exhortation or command in the Bible
is turned into mere evidence of our inability and God&amp;#8217;s grace toward us. This is
a&amp;nbsp;tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I was reading through Matthew 5&amp;#8211;9 this morning, I was struck again by the
force of Jesus&amp;#8217; moral teaching here. He takes major categories of sin and
intensifies the Old Testament&amp;#8217;s teaching on it: murder, adultery, penury, and
self-righteousness all come in for his condemnation here. Now, it is true that
the standard he sets is perfection: &amp;#8220;You therefore must be perfect, as your
heavenly Father is perfect,&amp;#8221; he says (Matthew 5:48, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESV&lt;/span&gt;). To be sure, none of us
can measure up to this standard. In one sense, then, those who point out that
this teaching shows us our need for Christ&amp;#8217;s salvation are absolutely&amp;nbsp;right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there is more going on here than merely highlighting our need for
Christ. There is a picture of kingdom ethics that we are too quick to step over.
&amp;#8220;Ah,&amp;#8221; we say, &amp;#8220;I can never be perfect, but thank God for covering my
imperfections!&amp;#8221; and we move along through our lives. This is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; what the text
requires of us; it is not what God requires of us. The resurrection of Christ
was like the first crack in a piece of glass, and our participation in his
resurrection is like the spidering of that crack out until the whole glass is
shattered completely. The old world has not yet passed away, but the new one is
pushing its way through the cracks, visible more and more in our lives as we
pursue holy&amp;nbsp;Christlikeness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least, that is how it ought to be. But this in-breaking of the new age is
hard work, and it is far easier to empty the Sermon on the Mount of its binding
force on our lives. It is easier to look at the moral instruction of Scripture
and see only one use of the Law: condemning sinners where they stand so they
will look to Christ. Yet the Law does more than this. It also teaches us what
God is like, and what his people ought to be like. So when Jesus says to us that
we must put aside our anger at our brothers and sisters, that we must do
whatever it takes to deal with lust, that we must not retaliate but instead go
above and beyond in serving those who do us harm, we must &lt;em&gt;obey&lt;/em&gt;. When he tells
us how to pray, how to fast, how to give to the needy (and, for that matter,
that we &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; to give generously to the needy), we must &lt;em&gt;obey&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said&amp;nbsp;both:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and
Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.&amp;#8221; (Matthew&amp;nbsp;5:20)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Not everyone who says to me, &amp;#8216;Lord, Lord,&amp;#8217; will enter the kingdom of heaven,
but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.&amp;#8221; (Matthew&amp;nbsp;7:21)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sermon on the Mount both tells us of our need for Christ because we cannot
be perfect, and requires us to genuinely pursue perfection to honor our&amp;nbsp;Savior.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chris Krycho</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 29 Jan 2014 08:14:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:www.chriskrycho.com,2014-01-29:2014/you-must-be-perfect.html</guid><category>devotions</category></item><item><title>The New Testament Needs the Old (and So Do You)</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/the-new-testament-needs-the-old-and-so-do-you.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Having just finished reading through the Chronicles, it is readily apparent how
Matthew self-consciously situated himself against the backdrop of the Old
Testament as he began composing his gospel. Just as the Old Testament carefully
preserved the lineages of the people&amp;#8212;most notably in Numbers and Chronicles&amp;#8212;
so Matthew carefully laid out the descent of Christ, showing that his (adoptive)
father&amp;#8217;s line ran true back through David.&lt;sup id="fnref:synoptic"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:synoptic" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; If, as some scholars of
the canon have speculated, Matthew&amp;#8217;s Old Testament canon concluded with
Chronicles,&lt;sup id="fnref:canon"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:canon" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; this beginning seems especially fitting, but in any case
Matthew was clearly interested in establishing continuity between his work and
the Hebrew&amp;nbsp;Bible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pick up this same thread in his constant use of the word &amp;#8220;fulfill.&amp;#8221; The way
Matthew uses the word has been much discussed among scholars, since many of the
passages he quotes are clearly &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; talking about the Messiah in particular.
While some see this as evidence of either Matthew&amp;#8217;s exegetical failure or the
validity of purely allegorical readings, I think&lt;sup id="fnref:Beale"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:Beale" rel="footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; the solution is
simpler. Matthew is using the word in a &lt;em&gt;simpler&lt;/em&gt; fashion. He means not
&amp;#8220;fulfill&amp;#8221; in the sense in which we use the word of formal prophecies, but &amp;#8220;fill
up&amp;#8221;. The Greek word &lt;em&gt;pleróō&lt;/em&gt; (πληρόω) covers both.&lt;sup id="fnref:semantic-range"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:semantic-range" rel="footnote"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; When Matthew
says that some event &amp;#8220;fulfills&amp;#8221; something from the Old Testament, he is not
arguing that the Old Testament bit he references was originally written about
Jesus, but rather that Jesus takes that original thing and fills it up with
&lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; meaning than it originally&amp;nbsp;had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combination of these two things, in any case, is to point us to the
Jewishness and the Old Testament background against which Jesus did his entire
ministry, and in which the church was born. Last semester and this semester, I
have been taking survey classes of the Old Testament, and I find them extremely
valuable. The Old Testament is underpreached in most churches, because (I think)
it is undervalued in most churches. Whether because of a simplistic and
misguided notion that the Old Testament has only law and the New Testament only
grace, or because the texts are harder to read for propositionally oriented
Westerners,&lt;sup id="fnref:proposition"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:proposition" rel="footnote"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; or simply because of unfamiliarity on the part of many
pastors, we skip over the Old Testament. We might draw on it for moral
statements from time to time, or to give some extra explanation for the
atonement&amp;#8212;but when was the last time you heard someone preach through Isaiah,
or Malachi, or 2&amp;nbsp;Chronicles?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a catastrophic loss to th echurch. Paul wrote that &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; Scripture was
breathed out by God and is profitable for us&amp;#8212;and the only canon he had at the
time was the Old Testament; he and his fellow apostles were still in the process
of composing the pieces that became the New Testament! The early church&amp;#8217;s Bible,
the texts from which they read, sang, and preached week in and week out, were
those of the Old Testament. They read the Psalms together, learned from the
Proverbs, chewed on Job, sought to imitate the saints of old, and above all
looked for the many ways their Messiah had been proclaimed and prefigured in the
pages of their book. They found there ample instruction in walking with God and
worshipping their risen Lord. Matthew found there the ground of his entire
gospel. Perhaps we would do well to do better in our love of the Old Testament,&amp;nbsp;too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:synoptic"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is much argument about the differing genealogies in Luke and
Matthew. This is an interesting discussion&amp;#8230; for something besides a devotional
post. Contrary to many a scholar, evangelical and dissenting alike, the so-
called synoptic problem comes &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; dealing with each book on its own terms.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:synoptic" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:canon"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the same books would have been present, just in a different order.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:canon" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following an article by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;G. K.&lt;/span&gt; Beale from several decades ago, a link

the vast majority of you to stupor in any case.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:Beale" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an important issue here for issues of translation,
and especially for the idea of &amp;#8220;word studies&amp;#8221;: namely, that they&amp;#8217;re basically
unhelpful. Words in different languages have different ranges of meanings. We
can see this at the most basic level in the Spanish word &amp;#8220;mesa&amp;#8221;, which partly
overlaps with the English word &amp;#8220;table&amp;#8221;, but extends to include things (like
bluffs) which the English word does not include. This happens all the time, and
accordingly just looking up all the places where a particular Greek word is used
can often produce more heat than light&amp;#8212;it will make you think that authors
mean the same thing in places where the context demands that they do not. I
really, really recommend that you avoid word studies for this reason.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:semantic-range" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

it was one of several books that almost did not end up in the canon. As has
often been noted, it includes no mention of God, nor even a reference to prayer.
The closest one comes to typical Jewish religious observance is the practice of
fasting under dire circumstances and the tearing of clothes and donning sackloth
and ashes in their place. But these were hardly unique to the worship of Yahweh;
they were common practice throughout the Ancient Near East. Moreover, the book
endorsed the practice of a feast beyond those listed in the Mosaic law: a
questionable practice at &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; from the perspective of many observant&amp;nbsp;Jews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet here it is, in most Jewish and all Christian canons.&lt;sup id="fnref:canon"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:canon" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Again: as many
commentators have noticed, Yahweh may not be mentioned by name, but his
handiwork is evident throughout the book. He is not mentioned, but he is still
present. His sovereignty is clear even in the absence of a prophetic declaration
of his intent or activity. Indeed, for this reason I think that the book is also
one of the most important books for understanding how God&amp;#8217;s actions in ordinary
life play&amp;nbsp;out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Scriptures are filled with records of God&amp;#8217;s speech to his people, and of his
miraculous intervention in their lives. From this, it can be easy to draw the
notion that this is the normal and ordinary course of affairs. In other words,
we might after reading through the histories of Israel conclude that we should
expect God to be sending prophetic messages and miracles our way on a regular
basis. Indeed,  large parts of the charismatic movement today are built around
that very expectation. When life remains ordinary, we are inevitably
disappointed. When we do not hear distinct, prophetic messages from God, we
inevitably go looking for substitutes, whether in the pronouncements of famous
Christians or our own &amp;#8220;inner sense&amp;#8221; of the Spirit&amp;#8217;s actions&amp;#8212;neither of which
are reliable guides, as I have &lt;a href="http://2012-2013.chriskrycho.com/theology/will-of-god/"&gt;argued
before&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, it is helpful to remember the circumstances under which those
prophets spoke and those miracles happened. Always, they were associated with
specific events in the redemptive history of the nation. Though they
occasionally impinged on the life of ordinary people (like the family with whom
Elisha repeatedly interacted, from miraculously overflowing oil to the
resurrection of a dead child), for the most part they involved the spiritual and
political leadership of the people of God. All this is true&amp;#8212;but true
&lt;em&gt;statements&lt;/em&gt; do not always communicate in the same way as do true &lt;em&gt;stories&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is this gap that Esther fills.&lt;sup id="fnref:gap"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:gap" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Here we have a story of God&amp;#8217;s saving his
people with no divine speech, and no obvious miraculous intervention. In their
place are ordinary people doing as best they can with the wisdom they have in
the (dreadful) circumstances they face. Here was a moment in redemptive history,
no less, with the fate of thousands of men and women hanging in the balance&amp;#8230;
where all the sorts of things we sometimes erroneously expect for the not-so-
significant moments in our own lives were simply&amp;nbsp;absent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not that God was absent; we see from the outcomes that his concern for his
people remained (he saved them) and his judgment on their enemies remained (he
destroyed them). We even see that &amp;#8220;many from the peoples of the country declared
themselves Jews, for the fear of the Jews had fallen on them&amp;#8221; (Esther 8:17b,
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESV&lt;/span&gt;)&amp;#8212;not exactly a typical event in Jewish history, but certainly part of the
end for which Yahweh had set them among the nations! Yet in all this, God
remains behind the scenes. So it most often is in our own lives. God&amp;#8217;s silence
does not imply his absence; nor does the ordinary nature of our lives imply his
uninvolvement. Quite the contrary: most of the time, in most people&amp;#8217;s lives, in
most places, God works by ordinary rather than extraordinary means. We get up,
go about our day, honoring him as best we may in our various vocations, and he
works &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; things to the praise of his glory and the good of those who love&amp;nbsp;him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank God for Esther and&amp;nbsp;Mordecai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:canon"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The existence of various canons is less troubling than many critics
would suggest&amp;#8212;not least because the core of all these canons is the same, and
the extra material in them rarely leads to significant doctrinal variations.
This is not to say that the distinctions are entirely unimportant, but rather to
say that it is less an issue for the reliability and authority of Scripture than
many naysayers would have you believe. More on this&amp;#8230; some other day.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:canon" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:gap"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not to say that this is the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; thing Esther is doing, but that it is
&lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; of the significant things the book does.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:gap" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Though I
have gone back and forth on the time of day in which I am best able to spend
time reading the Scriptures and praying, in &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; season of life it is
undeniably mornings. Our evenings are quite varied, for one thing. For another,
these days I am for more awake at 6:15 in the morning than I am at 9:15 (or, as
now, 10:15) at night. Thus, devotedly doing my devotions means doing them in the
morning for the most part, lest I have a hard time keeping my eyes&amp;nbsp;open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight&amp;#8217;s readings in Nehemiah covered passages with which I am quite familiar,
having looked at them many times. A few of them are proof texts for certain
views of preaching&amp;#8212;in particular, the way thtat the Levites gave the meaning
of the text so that the people could understand it is often used to buttress
support for expositional preaching. This, however, is a thoroughly ironic move
hermeneutically speaking. The passage is actually indicating that the Levites
were basically &lt;em&gt;translating&lt;/em&gt;, not offering explanatory commentary. Thus, it is a
failure of exposition to derive proof for expository preaching from the&amp;nbsp;text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of at least equal interest to me has always been the way Nehemiah responded to
the people&amp;#8217;s repentant reaction to hearing the Law of God proclaimed by Ezra.
Nehemiah encouraged the people not to focus on the sorrow of what they had done,
but on the joy of who their God was and what he had done on their behealf. The
same exhortation, it seems to me, is one that we should think about more often.
To be sure, it is good to be reminded of our sin and our failings. It is even
better, however, for us to turn from looking at ourselves and to look at the
Messiah who has saved us &lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt; those sins and failings. Too easily do many of
us fixate on the magnitude of our sin&amp;#8212;either thinking it too big for God to
really deal with, or too small for God to concern himself with, but in any case
focusing on the sin&amp;#8212;instead of on the one who has conquered sin once and for&amp;nbsp;all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May we instead learn, like Nehemiah exhorted the people, to &lt;em&gt;rejoice&lt;/em&gt; at what
God has done on our behalf, and to celebrate the ways in which he has worked
salvation in the midst of and through our sorrows and our&amp;nbsp;foibles.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chris Krycho</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jan 2014 22:30:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:www.chriskrycho.com,2014-01-25:2014/nehemiahs-exhortation.html</guid><category>devotions</category></item><item><title>What Was Their Sin?</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/what-was-their-sin.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;As Christians, we all recognize that Adam and Eve&amp;#8217;s first sin in the garden of
Eden prompted the catastropic Fall of all humanity, and that their eating of the
fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil was the &lt;em&gt;act&lt;/em&gt; of sin that
produced such horrific results in human history. What is perhaps less clear is
why that particular act was sinful. Was it disobedience? gaining knowledge?
pride? idolatry? The most straightforward reading of Genesis 3 makes it clear
that the act was sinful at the most basic level because it was disobedience, a
direct rejection of the stated will of God. God tells Adam that the consequences
he receives are because he ate of the tree from which he was commanded not to
eat&amp;nbsp;(3:17).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the more interesting question, then, is why disobedience to God is a
sin. As Christians, we acknowledge that the Bible teaches us this truth. Digging
deeper is helpful in understanding many things about God and the nature of both
humanity and the shape of the world we inhabit. To describe why disobedience is
sinful, though, requires that we first define what sin &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;. Sin is, at the most
basic level, failure&amp;#8212;missing the mark, as the Greek word would have it. The
next question, then, is: &lt;em&gt;Failure at&amp;nbsp;what?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sin is failure to be what humans were (and still are) meant to be&amp;#8212;a mystery of
ages, to which we have the answer. Genesis tells us exactly who we humans are.
We are made in the image of God. We are to be small icons of divine glory. The
divinity we are meant to recapitulate in miniature exists in perfect harmony, is
completely wise and wholly good, and exercises utter sovereignty. Women and men
are meant likewise to exist in true harmony, to be wise in right measure and
truly good, and to exercise sovereignty in our appointed spheres. This is what
it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; to be human: to do as God does in the ways he appoints in the world he&amp;nbsp;made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, to &lt;em&gt;fail&lt;/em&gt; at that task is no small thing. It is to fail in the most
significant way possible. Worse still, to fail as Adam and Eve did (and as we
all have ever since) can only happen in a conscious act. Yes, our natures are
now so corrupted that we all sin incidentally, too. But we all of us sin on
purpose. Our first father and mother did not fail accidentally. They willfully
rejected the very reason for their existence and spat in the face of the author
of that existence. (Here is the source of the human struggle for existential
meaning and the dread of meaningless that plagues us.) They rejected both the
shape of reality and the one who made reality. They rebelled. They became
traitors against the universe&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their sin, then, was not only disobedience. There are times when disobedience
might be right: one &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; reject unjust commands. This, however, was not such
a command. Their act of disobedience included both mistrust of most trustworthy
God and self-exaltation over and against the only exalted God. God does not only
demand our allegiance, he &lt;em&gt;deserves&lt;/em&gt; it. He requires our worship not because he
is vain, but because to worship anything else, however lovely, is to do injury
to the object of that worship, to ourselves, and to the Triune Godhead. Adam and
Eve&amp;#8217;s eating of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good represented
precisely that offense. They rejected God&amp;#8217;s sovereignty, his wisdom and
goodness, and even fellowship with him. They rejected their own sphere of
sovereignty, chose quick knowledge over wisdom, deceit over goodness, and
treachery over&amp;nbsp;communion.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chris Krycho</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jan 2014 08:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:www.chriskrycho.com,2014-01-25:2014/what-was-their-sin.html</guid><category>M.&amp;hairsp;Div.</category></item><item><title>From Creation to Consummation</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/from-creation-to-consummation.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Some texts are a bit more mysterious than they might at first appear. One such
is Psalm 24, at least for me. The poem has three basic&amp;nbsp;sections:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a declaration of Yahweh&amp;#8217;s possession of and sovereignty over the world he made
  (vv.&amp;nbsp;1&amp;#8211;2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a reflection on the character of one who may approach Yahweh (vv.&amp;nbsp;3&amp;#8211;6)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a call to and an act of exultation in the glory of Yahweh (vv.&amp;nbsp;7&amp;#8211;10)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first glance, there is no obvious connection between these three elements.
The third might seem to follow from the first to some extent, but the emphases
are all different. The first section addresses Yahweh&amp;#8217;s rule over creation; the
last enjoins gates and doors&lt;sup id="fnref:gates-doors"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:gates-doors" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to worship him on the basis that he
&amp;#8212;Yahweh of hosts&amp;#8212;is the king of glory. The middle section, on the character
of those who can approach him, seems completely disconnected from&amp;nbsp;either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet David, the author of the Psalm, was not an idiot. When we find passages like
this in Scripture and cannot at first see how to put them together, it behooves
us to take a step back and consider them at further length.&lt;sup id="fnref:consider"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:consider" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; David
intended his poem to be understood, and not by God only. The pieces &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; relate;
the question is simply &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; they fit. As is the way of all good poetry, there
are holes here, and they require of the audience a bit more engagement than
would a direct statement of David&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;intent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, these pieces do relate. Each points us to a different aspect of
Yahweh&amp;#8217;s nature. Indeed, the outline I wrote out above is actually a good
summary of David&amp;#8217;s intent here. In verses 1&amp;#8211;2, we see that Yahweh owns the
world he made. He is both creator and ruler. He is sovereign over creation,
including the men and women who live in this world. Then, in verses 3&amp;#8211;6, we see
his moral character. The requirements for anyone to approach Yahweh&amp;#8217;s holy place
tell us just as much about Yahweh as about those who seek him: he is holy, he
has clean hands (meaning he has not done nothing wrong), he is pure in heart, he
rejects all idolatry, and he is utterly trustowrthy. Moreover, he blesses those
who are like him; he makes them righteous and saves them. Finally in verses 7&amp;#8211;
10, we see that he is glorious, strong and mighty, a king. He is not just &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt;
king, but &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; King of glory. He owns glory; it is his and no other&amp;#8217;s. He is
stronger than any who would oppose him. He will triumph over his enemies. He
will come into the city and take up his&amp;nbsp;reign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, the Psalm moves us from creation to consummation. Yahweh made and
rules over the world. He calls his people to be holy, as he is holy, and he
makes them righteous and saves them. He will come into his glory as the King.
And David gets us there without ever coming out and saying those bare facts; the
poem moves our hearts the more thoroughly because he makes us work for us, and
because he does so with such aching&amp;nbsp;beauty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Lift up your heads, O gates!
    And lift them up, O ancient doors,
    that the King of glory may come in.
Who is this King of glory?
    Yahweh of hosts,
    he is the King of glory! Selah. (Psalm 24:9–10)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hallelujah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:gates-doors"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over-familiarity with the text has also perhaps dulled us to the
curiosity of this exhortation. Perhaps there was something going on culturally
we are missing today, but this is the only place in Scripture that anyone
addresses gates and doors, to my knowledge.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:gates-doors" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:consider"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, that assumes we are paying enough attention to recognize
that the poem is doing something unusual in the first place&amp;#8212;and, dare I say
it, we too rarely are paying heed so closely.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:consider" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;My son, give me your heart,
    and let your eyes observe my ways.
For a prostitue is a deep pit;
    a foreign woman is a narrow well. (Proverbs 23:26--27, ESV)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:fw"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:fw" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;The latter half of Ezra explains how it is that the people of Israel &lt;a href="/2014/justice-mercy-same-stroke/"&gt;turned
away&lt;/a&gt; from their pattern of idolatry&amp;#8212;and it
wasn&amp;#8217;t pretty or easy. After the people began building the temple again under
the leadership of Haggai and Zechariah, after the favor shown to the Jews by the
kings Darius and Artaxerxes, and after Ezra made his God-favored journey from
Babylon to Jerusalem bearing more gifts and entrusted to teach the people the
law, everything once again nearly went wrong because of an old pattern the Jews
were embracing. Despite the clear instruction of the Law of Yahweh, they were
intermarrying with the people around&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The instruction not to intermarry was not racism, even if some abused it to that
end. Those who did missed the point entirely, for Yahweh had always welcomed the
outsider into his people. Indeed, the very existence of Israel was predicated on
Yahweh&amp;#8217;s choosing for himself someone who was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; following him. Likewise, the
kingly line had in it multiple outsiders (most notably Rahab and Ruth). No, the
point was not the superiority of the Jews over the people around them&amp;#8212;a notion
that their history should have made clear was laughable in any case&amp;#8212;but the
protection of their &lt;em&gt;worship&lt;/em&gt;. Every time that Israelites began intermarrying
with the people around them, they also began following the worship practices of
the people around them. They started worshipping idols, every single&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the prohibition on intermarriage was not a matter of racial distinction,
but of religious distinction, and Israel&amp;#8217;s history bore out the necessity of the
policy. Yet in Ezra 9, we find that once again they were slipping into the same
old pattern. Ezra&amp;#8217;s response might be startling without that history. Even apart
from a pattern of this same folly, though, his response is the right one from a
shepherd when God&amp;#8217;s people disobey him. There is a lesson here for pastors and
ministers: Ezra&amp;#8217;s first response was grief and a prayer of corporate repentance.
Only after offering that prayer did he move to deal with the&amp;nbsp;sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mundane&lt;sup id="fnref:mundane"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:mundane" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; response Ezra made is interesting and has been much
debated, given God&amp;#8217;s stated opposition to divorce. While we might speculate
about the outcomes of the decision for the women and children affected by
requiring these Israelite men to put them away, we have no grounds to do so.
Certainly we can say that the right thing for these men to do would have been to
provide for the families they had created, even while no longer having them as
spouses. As to what they actually did, though, we simply have no basis for
speaking one way or another. What we can say with confidence is that Ezra&amp;#8217;s
actions here underscore the seriousness with which he took keeping the Law of
God. Holiness mattered to him&amp;#8212;and not just his own personal holiness, but the
holiness of the people of&amp;nbsp;God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it ought to be for us, especially those of us who seek to be teachers and
leaders within the church. If we are to be the bride of Christ, we must seek to
be &lt;em&gt;wholly&lt;/em&gt; pure. A bride does not care only that her face and one of her dress
sleeves are white; she cares that her whole appearance is radiant and beautiful
when she meets her groom. So let us diligently pursue both our own holiness and
that of our brothers and sisters in&amp;nbsp;Christ.&lt;/p&gt;

chapters of the Chronicles that immediately precede it. Though some of the pages
are taken up with similar, &lt;a href="/2014/grappling-
with-genealogies/"&gt;uninteresting(-at-least-to-us)&lt;/a&gt; details of the number of people who returned from the Exile
to rebuild the temple of God under the command of Cyrus, other parts of this
passage indicate the significant change that had taken place in the people of
Judah and Benjamin and Levi during their sojourn far from their homes. In short:
they had learned not to worship other gods. This becomes increasingly clear
throughout Ezra-Nehemiah, and as one comes to the New Testament it is obvious
that the lesson did indeed&amp;nbsp;stick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that the Jews had no ongoing religious issues. They did, to
be sure. But these issues were not the issue of idolatry, at least in the strict
sense of the word. Tim Keller would likely argue that the issues they had were
still matters of idolatry of a sort, and I would be inclined to agree with him;
but in any case, they were no longer putting up Asherah poles or making
sacrifices to Baal or Molech. There were many consequences of the Exile,
including the end of the Davidic line of kings over Judah, the loss of the Ark
of the Covenant, and the destruction of the First Temple. Most important of all,
though, was this reality that the Jews never again engaged in large-scale
worship of gods besides Yahweh. Their functional &lt;abbr title="the belief in and worship of a single God while accepting the"&gt;henotheism&lt;/abbr&gt; gave way at last to
true&amp;nbsp;monotheism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is amazing to me&amp;#8212;and wonderful&amp;#8212;that the result of God&amp;#8217;s judgment was not
only the punishment of the judged but also their hearts being changed. He used a
dreadful consequence to bring about real, lasting change in his people. It
strikes me that sometimes we see exactly this, albeit on a smaller scale, in our
own lives. There are times when we run far astray, and in his &lt;em&gt;mercy&lt;/em&gt; he judges
us, so that we will return to him. Now, there is a final judgment beyond which
there is no return, but in the interval, how great his grace! This is a double
blessing to us who follow Christ: First, it reminds us that if we stray, he is
faithful to send opportunity after opportunity (usually increasingly &lt;em&gt;painful&lt;/em&gt;
opportunity) for our repentance. Second, it gives us reason not to go astray at
all, realizing that the further we run, the more difficult will be our judgment.
In both, we are reminded to worship our God: who judges justly and mercifully in
the same&amp;nbsp;stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;existence or possible existence of other deities that may also be worshipped.

chapters that preceded them. Over and over again, kings rise and fall;
generation to generation, the fortunes of the people rise and fall with their
fidelity to Yahweh. From Hezekiah&amp;#8217;s reliance on Yahweh and God&amp;#8217;s corresponding
triumph over the armies of Sennacherib of Assyria, to the final end of the
Judaic kingdom&lt;sup id="fnref:judaic"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:judaic" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; in the rebellions of Jehoiakim and Jehoiachin, the same
themes that dominated the rest of the book are on full display here. Reliance on
Yahweh leads to salvation and deliverance. Abandoning Yahweh leads to
destruction. The narrative of human history, personal and corporate, played out
time and again in the public history of&amp;nbsp;Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many things that could be said of these chapters, but two points in
particular caught my attention, both of which have been present throughout the
book and so warrant some remarks here at the&amp;nbsp;end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the transition from generation to generation was rarely smooth. I do not
mean merely the actual intrigues of the courts, of which there were clearly
quite a few, what with multiple kings suffering assassination at the hands of
their promptly-executed servants. Rather, I mean the spiritual succession. There
are a few generations recorded here where multiple successive kings followed
Yahweh wholeheartedly. Mostly, though, the kings bounced back and forth between
fidelity and faithlessness (with no few examples of simple vacillation). Each
father&amp;#8217;s son charted his own course. As a father myself, this is simultaneously
a cause for hope and reason to pray the more faithfully for my own children. I
must pray for them and seek earnestly to make disciples of them because there is
no guarantee that they will follow Christ simply because I do. By the same
token, there is hope that they will walk with God despite my own failings and
follies. No child is doomed or blessed to walk her father&amp;#8217;s path; she makes her
own&amp;nbsp;choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second is the sheer efficacy of the Scriptures. Every time that the people were
confronted with the word of God, they moved to repentance. They tore down idols,
repaired the temple, and engaged once again in the practices outlined by the Law
for purification and sacrifices. Time and again, it was the word of God that
convicted people. It is tempting to try to stir people up to love and good works
by our own efforts, but nothing we do will ever be as effective as the word of
God, which is the Spirit&amp;#8217;s appointed means for sanctifying his people. For every
minister in the world, and indeed for every believer in the world, this ought to
be an enormous encouragement. We do not need to be people of unusual skill at
public speaking, or especially effective debators. We simply need to know the
word of God and lean hard on it, trusting that the Holy Spirit will use it. Yes,
we should grow in our knowledge and understanding, and seek to become more
skillful in the ways in which we interact with others. Ultimately, though, it is
God&amp;#8217;s words that prove effective for turning people to him. That is good news&amp;nbsp;indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:judaic"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, there was a &amp;#8220;king&amp;#8221; in Judea later, but the domain of which Herod
was a representative was not Judaic or Davidic but instituted by outsiders for
their own ends.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:judaic" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who can say, &amp;#8220;I have made my heart pure;&lt;br /&gt;
I am clean from my sin&amp;#8221;? (Proverbs 20:9, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESV&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet again, the annals of the kings of Judah point to the need for a different
kind of king&amp;#8212;one who is faithful in the long run. Joash was a boy when he
became king, rescued from the threat of death at the hands of his own power-mad
grandmother by a faithful priest. For the days of that priest, he remained
faithful, but after his death, he fell so far that he had that priest&amp;#8217;s son
murdered for daring to &amp;#8220;speak truth to power&amp;#8221; in pointing out the folly of
Joash&amp;#8217;s idolatry. How far must one fall to kill the son of the man who saved
your life and put you on the throne? Yet this is how idolatry works. It corrupts
and twists our senses, until we call evil good and good&amp;nbsp;evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when he was strong, he grew proud, to his destruction. For he was
unfaithful to the &lt;span class=smcp&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; his God and entered the temple
of the &lt;span class=smcp&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; to burn incense on the altar of incense.
(2 Chronicles 26:16, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESV&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uzziah follows the same pattern laid out by so many kings of Judah before him.
He started well, but finished badly. Of the many themes of the book of
Chronicles, one that comes home time and again is the risk of setting out to
follow God and being turned aside in the course of life. Deadliest of all the
lures for these kings was always the temptation to pride and confidence in their
own strength. I see this, watching successful men and women today. How often do
we choose people to lead us because we recognize their godliness and character,
and then see them stumble into folly as pride consumes them? Too often. The
example stands as a warning to all of us, but especially to any who wish to
lead. If God grants us success&amp;#8212;especially the kind of success so prized by the
world and by our flesh&amp;#8212;we must be doubly wary against the poisonous seeds of
pride that so easily take root in our&amp;nbsp;hearts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most striking here is the particular way in which Uzziah fell. In this
case, it was not as in so many others a matter of folly in battle. Rather, it
was folly in worship. Uzziah seems to have come under the impression that his
military victories indicated such a degree of God&amp;#8217;s favor&amp;#8212;such a degree of his
own righteousness before God&amp;#8212;that he could disregard the ways God had
commanded his people to approach him. He disregarded the supreme holiness of
God, and took lightly the laws that Yahweh had laid out. It cost him everything
on which he had prided himself; he spent the end of his life a leper alone.
God&amp;#8217;s response to Uzziah&amp;#8217;s actions here serve as a stark reminder to me not to
take worship lightly, and not to dishonor God by taking &lt;em&gt;him&lt;/em&gt; lightly. He is
holy, and we ought never dare to trifle with&amp;nbsp;him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Steadfast love and faithfulness preserve the king  
    and by steadfast love his throne is upheld. (Proverbs 20:28)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whose steadfast love and faithfulness preserve a king, and whose steadfast love
upholds the throne of a king? It is Yahweh: a God merciful and gracious,
abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness. It is the king who is above all
the other kings. Proverbs points in unison with the Chronicles to the Messianic
king. Praise be to God for his work in Christ Jesus. Hallelujah for a king who
will  &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; turn his back on his God or on his people, who will not lead the
people into idolatry or presumptuous worship, but who is himself &lt;em&gt;able&lt;/em&gt; to serve
as priest, prophet, and&amp;nbsp;king.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chris Krycho</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jan 2014 23:30:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:www.chriskrycho.com,2014-01-20:2014/ending-badly.html</guid><category>devotions</category></item><item><title>Invest!—Memorizing Scripture</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/invest-memorizing-scripture.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, I am pausing from my normal discussion of the passages I&amp;#8217;ve been
reading, to discuss instead how Jaimie and I have begun memorizing Scripture
together this spring.&lt;sup id="fnref:memorization-confession"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:memorization-confession" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Both of us have been persuaded
of the value of memorizing Scripture for a long time (since before we met, and
indeed since before we were in college).&lt;sup id="fnref:value"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:value" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Jaimie&amp;#8217;s private Christian
school included Scripture memorization as part of its curriculum, and the church
at which I grew up likewise emphasized it as a useful discipline. Accordingly,
both of us learned at relatively  young ages to practice memorizing verses from
the Bible. We may not have been &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWANA&lt;/span&gt; champions, but both of us have a good bit
of the Bible stored in our&amp;nbsp;memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During college, as I studied the Bible and studied hermeneutics, I became
increasingly convinced that the approach I had been taking to memorizing
Scripture was, if not exactly &lt;em&gt;unhelpful&lt;/em&gt; (learning the Bible is a good move,
full stop), nonetheless not nearly as helpful as it could be. Specifically, my
emphasis on memorizing a verse here and a verse there&amp;#8212;even when I went so far
as to memorize the whole sentence&amp;#8212;seemed to me to prevent me from really
remembering the full meaning of the passage in question. Several times, I
discovered that a verse I had memorized meant something other than what I had
thought, as I studied its context carefully. It did not take but a few of these
incidents for me to decide that I wanted to try something different.
Accordingly, I decided to stoip memorizing individual verses or short passages,
and to try instead to memorize a book of the Bible. That way, every single verse
would automatically be in context for&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are probably thinking I was crazy, and/or (for those of you who know me
well) that it is a typically over-the-top Chris Krycho thing to do. In some ways
that might be true, at least in the details of my implementation: I jumped in
with Hebrews, since it is one of my favorite books in the Bible. Things were
actually going fairly well with that project; I had succesfully memorized up
through chapter 7 and was working on verse 8&amp;#8230; and then I graduated from
college. Suddenly, the 15&amp;#8211;20 minutes each day in which I had been accustomed to
walking around on campus&amp;#8212;the time in which I had been practicing my Scripture
memory&amp;#8212;was gone. I fell out of the habit, and never finished memorizing the&amp;nbsp;book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward three and a half years. Jaimie and I moved to North Carolina, and
we started attending and soon joined &lt;a href="http://www.fbcdurham.org/"&gt;First Baptist Church of
Durham&lt;/a&gt;. During our membership class, we received an
interesting little booklet written by our senior pastor, Andy Davis, &lt;a href="http://www.fbcdurham.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Scripture-Memory-Booklet-for-Publication-Website-Layout.pdf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;An
Approach to Extended Memorization of Scripture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Curious, I read
through it that evening. Pastor Davis outlined there both the benefits of
memorizing Scripture and&amp;#8212;to my surprise and interest&amp;#8212;basically the same
concerns I had had about memorizing individual passages out of context. But then
he did something profoundly helpful: he also provided a practical,
straightforward system to help people learn to memorize extended sections of
Scripture (i.e. &lt;em&gt;books&lt;/em&gt;). And not just crazy, over-the-top, intense people like
Chris Krycho. Ordinary, not so strange&amp;nbsp;people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last fall, Jaimie and I started trying to memorize Philippians together.
However, we did not have a system or a plan, and the attempt ended up going off
the rails. We were moving at different paces, we were not helping each other
review, and the whole thing eventually just sort of slid to a halt in the face
of our busy lives and our lack of a plan. As part of our start to the new year,
though, I suggested that we look at Pastor Davis&amp;#8217; materials and see if they
would work for us. As it turns out, they do&amp;#8212;they work really, really&amp;nbsp;well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jaimie and I are 12 verses into Colossians 1, two weeks along. The system,
simple as it is, has been easy to keep up each day, and has helped us stay in
sync. We review together pretty much every day, and it has been a real joy.
Picking a shorter book helps a lot, too: it feels more doable. By the time our
next child is born in early June (Lord willing), we will have finished the book
and be reviewing&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic system itself is&amp;nbsp;simple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pick a book. (Start short. Dr. Davis recommends Ephesians, and I certainly
  wouldn&amp;#8217;t go longer than&amp;nbsp;that.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Day 1: read 1:1 ten times out loud, then repeat it ten times from&amp;nbsp;memory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Day 2: repeat 1:1 ten times from memory, checking the text if you need to.
  Once you finish that, read 1:2 ten times out loud, and then repeat it ten
  times from&amp;nbsp;meory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Days 3 and following: repeat all previously memorized verses once from memory.
  Then repeat the previous day&amp;#8217;s verse 10 times from memory. Then read the next
  verse ten times out loud, and then repeat it ten times from&amp;nbsp;memory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This way, one always reviews previous material in the book, but without it
taking overly long. For example, on day 6, one would review 1:1&amp;#8211;5 from memory,
say 1:5 another 9 times out loud from memory, read 1:6 out loud ten times, and
then repeat 1:6 ten times from&amp;nbsp;memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be honest, this system works &lt;em&gt;far&lt;/em&gt; better than the approach I had been taking
on my own, both when I was memorizing Hebrews years ago and when I was working
on Philippians last fall. The specific, active repetition helps solidify the
verses in my head, which is important, especially because there are some verses
that are just&amp;nbsp;hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pastor Davis outlines a good deal more in his &lt;a href="http://www.fbcdurham.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Scripture-Memory-Booklet-for-Publication-Website-Layout.pdf"&gt;booklet&lt;/a&gt;, including
arguing for the value of memorizing Scripture, why tackling longer stretches is
helpful, and discussing both how to learn longer books and how to remember the
books one has already learned. I commend this approach to you, even as I urge
you strongly to consider making Scripture memory a regular spiritual&amp;nbsp;discipline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:memorization-confession"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We actually tried starting this in the fall. It
didn&amp;#8217;t work out so well. Keep reading.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:memorization-confession" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:value"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are not persuaded, I am not here going to make a full attempt
to persuade you. Suffice it to say that I find it enormously helpful to have
God&amp;#8217;s revelation stored up in my mind&amp;#8212;I find that the Holy Spirit often uses
it to convict me or encourage me throughout the day, and that it is incredibly
valuable in interacting with others, whether building up fellow believers or
speaking with those who do not believe.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:value" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Proverbs assigns to warning fools about the quantity of their speech than to
almost any other part of the Proverbs.&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I have many faults, but one of the
most significant and ongoing is a tendency to be quick to speak and slow to hear
(and yes, quick to become angry)&amp;#8212;to invert the order commended by James in the
New Testament. This is no small&amp;nbsp;thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Death and life are in the power of the tongue,  
    and those who love it will eat its fruits. (Proverbs 18:21)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though I have sometimes heard this verse misused (as though to suggest a
mystical power in our speech&amp;#8212;a view for which I think there is no warrant),
the plain meaning alone is enough to give a person with my proclivities pause.
If my one of my chief follies is the tendency to speak too freely and without
sufficient consideration, what death have I wrought? Where might I have brought
life instead? When I speak with Jaimie or with Ellie, when having long talks
with friends, when offering my thoughts publicly, my words matter. &lt;em&gt;All&lt;/em&gt; words
matter. Jesus warned the Pharisees (and warns us, lest we be like&amp;nbsp;them):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tell you, on the day of judgment people will give account for every careless
word they speak, for by your words you will be justified, and by your words
you will be condemned. (Matthew 12:36&amp;#8211;37, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESV&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The words one chooses to use&amp;#8212;the words &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; choose to use&amp;#8212;can build others up
or cut them down. They can encourage, or they can wound. They can bring life or&amp;nbsp;death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;A fool takes no pleasure in understanding,  
    but only in expressing his opinion.

A fool's lips walk into a fight,  
    and his mouth invites a beating.  
A fool's mouth is his ruin,  
    and his lips are a snare to his soul.

If one gives an answer before he hears,  
    it is his folly and shame. (Proverbs 18:2, 6--7, 13)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a bit painful to think how often I have been a fool in these terms. It is
a caution to me in writing these very posts. Yes, it is good to take time to
reflect on the things I am learning from the Scriptures. It is, I think,
profitable to post these particular reflections publicly.&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; There is, however,
a serious danger that my writing could be an act of folly, and the more so the
quicker I am to write before carefully considering the matter at&amp;nbsp;hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I write on Scripture, I have one sort of responsibility: to honor the text,
and in so doing to honor the one who authored the text. Few of us should seek to
be teachers, because we will be held to a higher standard of judgment for our
words. If I speak falsely of Scripture, there is a real chance that I will do
harm to others&amp;#8217; spiritual health. When I write on other topics, I have a
different sort of responsibility, but one no less weighty for that. If I
publicly opine on politics, address personal situations in our lives, or discuss
the contours of evangelical Christianity, my words will undoubtedly be read by
people who stand either to benefit or to be injured by those words. Again: to
write without careful consideration would be to risk bringing spiritual harm. In
both cases, I would be in danger of dishonoring the God who gave us&amp;nbsp;words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is particularly important for those of us who love words. I am obsessed
with the beauty and power of human language, awed by the gift God bestowed on us
in the creative potential of phonemes and clauses and sentences and paragraphs.
I can (and, my friends can all wearily attest, &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt;) wax eloquent at the drop of
a pin. This delight is a good thing; it is a part of the &lt;em&gt;imago dei&lt;/em&gt; in me. Yet
my words are not to be their own ends. They, like I myself, exist for a cause
greater than that. They are meant to serve God. If they do not, they will bring
death. If they do, they will bring&amp;nbsp;life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only other repeated warning I have considered as carefully is that on
sexual immorality&amp;#8212;an area in which all young people are especially tempted.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would not necessarily be profitable to post &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; reflection
publicly. Some of them would do the public no good, and posting them would be
only a way of seeking attention in a way that would feed those selfsame sins.
Confession is good. But confession is done with brothers and sisters in close
fellowship&amp;#8212;not with the world at large.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

a night last night, and am accordingly skipping over the relevant chapters. I
fell asleep just after reading said chapters&amp;#8212;so the &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; important aspect of
this project, I still accomplished. Huzzah. As for why I got to it so late (and
why I am again tonight)&amp;#8230; that will have to wait for next Tuesday to&amp;nbsp;explain.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great deal of the latter parts of the Chronicles&amp;#8212;as in Kings&amp;#8212;are concerned
with the deeds men who decided &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to submit to Yahweh. Solomon&amp;#8217;s son,
Rehoboam, set the tone for much of what followed. He began by obeying and
worshiping God, but all too soon he went his own way. The Chronicler summarizes
Rehoboam&amp;#8217;s turn  in a single sentence that I found strikingly&amp;nbsp;provocative:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the rule of Rehoboam was established and he was strong, he abaondoned the
law of the &lt;span class=smcp&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, and all Israel with him. (2
Chronicles&amp;nbsp;12:1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His deeds bore this out.  Whereas in the beginning of his reign Rehoboam was
sensible enough to obey Yahweh when God spoke to the king through a prophet and
warned him not to go to war with Jeroboam of Israel, his habits had&amp;nbsp;changed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were continual wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam (2 Chronicles&amp;nbsp;12:15b)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right there we have a perfect summary not only of the folly of so many kings of
Judah in the years that followed Rehoboam, but of many of us as well. We turn to
God in desperation in times of trouble, or when we are seeking security, but as
soon as times are good and things seem to be going well with us, we are quick to
abandon him. We begin to disobey, deciding our way is better and relying on our
own wisdom. Never mind that we came to whatever point of success we have
achieved only because God granted it to us in his&amp;nbsp;grace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next chapter records the reign of Rehoboam&amp;#8217;s son Ahijah&amp;#8212;a man who, it
seems, recognized the power of Yahweh but did not fully submit to his rule. He
happily relied on Yahweh when waging war, but (like his father, grandfather
Solomon, and great-grandfather David before him) he rejected God&amp;#8217;s law when it
came to taking multiple wives.&lt;sup id="fnref:wives"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:wives" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This sort of going halfway &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; seems
to characterize us all too frequently. We are happy to accept God&amp;#8217;s help, and
may even be zealous for him in some ways, but too often are unwilling to submit
to his&amp;nbsp;law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahijah&amp;#8217;s son Asa provides one more picture of a way that we often go wrong. He
began exceedingly well. He relied on Yahweh for victory in war, and he also
faithfully pursued his ways at home. He led Judah to break down their altars to
other gods and pledge themselves to the worship of Yahweh, the one true God. He
exiled even his own grandmother because of her devotion to idols. In short, if
we had only chapter 15, we would think Asa a model king&amp;#8212;but the Chronicler
adds an unhappy ending to the story. As Asa grew old, he turned away from the
wisdom of his youth and decided to rely not on the strength of God for his
country&amp;#8217;s defense but on his own political machinations and the strength in arms
of neighboring nations.&lt;sup id="fnref:politics"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:politics" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; That he was now going thoroughly off the
rails becomes quite clear as one reads that he tortured the priest who told him
that Yahweh disapproved of his treaty, and that he refused even in his illness
to seek God&amp;#8217;s aid. There is a warning here: starting well does not guarantee one
will finish&amp;nbsp;well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over and over again, as one reads through the Chronicles with Yahweh&amp;#8217;s
resounding promise to David in mind&amp;#8212;that promise of a son whose throne would
be established forever&amp;#8212;one is left disappointed. Beginning with Solomon, every
single king misses the mark in some way. Either he flatly rejects Yahweh, or he
simply finds an area in which he will not obey, or he falls away from wisdom as
he ages. On and on go their follies&amp;#8212;the defects in character and failings in
every virtue. But in this way, Rehoboam, Ahijah, and Asa all serve us still.
They point us to the one king who did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; fail, the man from the line of
David, of the tribe of Judah, the great-grandson of Abraham, the offspring of
the woman, born of a woman. That king never sinned. No matter how many years
passed, he remained steadfast in the face of temptation to err (and remains
steadfast in his prayers for us). He has but one bride, whom he awaits still.
Jesus the Messiah is that&amp;nbsp;King.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:wives"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it is just me, but the idea of having multiple wives is
somewhat terrifying. Jaimie is more than enough mystery for one lifetime. I
think two women would leave me confounded without ceasing.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:wives" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:politics"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that making alliances is not an inherently ungodly thing to
do. The trick was that here it &lt;em&gt;clearly&lt;/em&gt; demonstrated Asa&amp;#8217;s lack of faith in
Yahweh to save Judah, standing in rather stark contrast to his behavior in his
youth.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:politics" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chris Krycho</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2014 23:55:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:www.chriskrycho.com,2014-01-17:2014/every-king-broken.html</guid><category>devotions</category></item><item><title>Who Can Dwell With God?</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/who-can-dwell-with-god.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Psalm 15, like many of the Psalms, has a double purpose. It points us
simultaneously to whom we ought to aim to be as we strive to be holy as God is
holy, and to Christ, the only one who has ever perfectly walked out these words.
Walking through the passage tonight provided an opportunity both to pray for the
Holy Spirit to make me more like these words, and to worship the Holy One of God
who has actually fulfilled&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David opens with a provocative, challenging&amp;nbsp;question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Oh &amp;lt;span class=smcp&amp;gt;Lord&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;, who shall sojourn in your tent?  
    Who shall dwell on your holy hill? (Psalm 15:1, ESV)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who indeed? The Psalms have already shown us&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; the image of a holy God who
will brook no injustice and who hates sin passionately, but who is also the
covenant-keeper and salvation of&amp;nbsp;Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;He who walks blamelessly and does what is right  
    and speaks truth in his heart; ... (Psalm 15:2, ESV)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is quite the target to hit already. Who &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; walks blameless and does
what is right? Not I. Who is &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; self-deceived (still less never deceitful
toward others)? Again, not&amp;nbsp;I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;…who does not slander with his tongue  
    and does no evil to his neighbor,  
    nor takes up a reproach against his friend; ... (Psalm 15:3, ESV)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of us have slandered our neighbors and taken up a reproach against friends.
We have spoken cruelly of those we love, been harsh in our assessments of people
over whom we have no such right to stand in judgment. We have been unkind to
friends and held against them their sins. All of us have done evil to our
neighbors&amp;#8212;there is no one among us who has escaped and managed to avoid ever
harming anyone near&amp;nbsp;us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;…in whose eyes a vile person is despised,  
    but who honors those who fear the Lord… (Psalm 15:4a, ESV)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many of us can truly say that we have this kind of heart&amp;#8212;that we always
earnestly oppose those who rebel against God, and honor those who fear Him?
Again: not I. Too often I make excuses for those who do not know God, rather
than call their idolatrous and treacherous way of life as it is. Too often I am
impatient and unkind and derogatory toward those who &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; walk with&amp;nbsp;God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;who swears to his own hurt and does not change;  
    who does not put out his money at interest  
and does not take a bribe against the innocent.  
    He who does these things shall never be moved. (Psalm 15:4b--5, ESV)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many of us have made a promise and then gone back on it because it became
inconvenient? How many of us have, if not literally charged interest, then held
it against people when it took them a long time to pay us back on money we lent
them? To what extent are we &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; complicit in crimes against the innocent, even
when we ourselves have kept our hands clean&amp;#8212;just by dint of our lives in a
fallen world, as part of a fallen nation, where every year sees innocent lives
lost at our&amp;nbsp;hands?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is not much hope for any of us to stand on God&amp;#8217;s holy hill even for a
moment&amp;#8212;still less to dwell there forever. But Christ has measured up to every
line that David raised, and gone beyond them. He stands in our stead, his
righteousness granted to us, our failings taken on his own body. His Spirit
empowers us to pursue this kind of life: fleeing sin and pursuing the holiness
of God. May we seek to look more like Christ, who alone  has the right to
sojourn in Yahweh&amp;#8217;s tent and who alone has the right to dwell on his holy hill
&amp;#8212;but who has invited all of us in to the feast in that temple and to sit at
his feet and eat the bread that satisfies on his&amp;nbsp;mountain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I take the view that the Psalms, in addition to being valuable in their
own right individually, were organized by an editor who knew what he or she was
about. That editor&amp;#8217;s decisions about where to put the Psalms is often
illuminating&amp;#8212;much as it is with any other collection.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chris Krycho</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2014 23:55:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:www.chriskrycho.com,2014-01-15:2014/who-can-dwell-with-god.html</guid><category>devotions</category></item><item><title>Practical Wisdom</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/01-14-practical-wisdom.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;The Proverbs contain a striking mix of profound theological statements and
practical, down-to-earth wisdom. Often the two come right next to each
other,&lt;sup id="fnref:contrast?"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:contrast?" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and are both made all the more illuminating by way of the
juxtaposition. The book&amp;#8217;s pages also include no few beautiful gems of insight
into the human condition. Some of each caught my attention tonight as I read
through Proverbs&amp;nbsp;14.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="on-the-human-condition"&gt;On the human&amp;nbsp;condition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;The heart knows its own bitterness,  
    and no stranger shares its joy. (Proverbs 14:10, ESV)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And&amp;nbsp;again:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Even in laughter the heart may ache,  
    and the end of joy may be grief. (Provebs 14:13, ESV)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of these speak to realities we have all experienced. To be human in a
fallen world is to be lonely at times&amp;#8212;to know that one&amp;#8217;s heart can never be
shared perfectly with another. There are times when our hearts ache with this
knowledge: because our grief is so deep that we wish another could partake of it
with us and so ease the ache, and because our hearts are so full of gladness
that we wish another could partake of it with us and so share the merriment. But
we cannot. We are sundered from one another. But not finally so. We were made
for better than this. Some day we will taste of it. In the long wait until that
day, we may content ourselves with this: that very God of very God has drunk the
bowl of our grief and supped with us in joy-making&amp;#8212;we are&amp;nbsp;known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="practical-insights"&gt;Practical&amp;nbsp;insights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;A truthful witness saves lives,  
    but one who breathes out lies is deceitful. (Proverbs 14:25, ESV)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one seems both straightforward and obvious to me. It is interesting,
though, that the author makes the point that the truthful witness &lt;em&gt;saves lives&lt;/em&gt;.
It reminds me that our lenient age, with death a rare punishment for any crime,
no matter how severe, is very different from almost every other. The word of a
witness, in those days, meant the difference between a man being stoned to death
and his going home to his family. Yet it is no less important today. I read
recently of a case of wrongful conviction&amp;#8212;a man sentenced to prison for a
crime he did not commit, which it is now &lt;em&gt;known&lt;/em&gt; he did not commit, and still he
cannot get out of jail&amp;#8212;and all this because of a false testimony delivered on
the stand many decades ago. &lt;sup id="fnref:justice"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:justice" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Our words still have the power to make or
ruin lives. Sometimes these are dramatic moments; other times they are the many
little moments that add up to a larger shift in the course of one&amp;#8217;s life. Either
way, telling the truth&amp;nbsp;matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="theological-profundities"&gt;Theological&amp;nbsp;profundities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;In the fear of the &amp;lt;span class=smcp&amp;gt;Lord&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; one has strong confidence,  
    and his children will have a refuge.  
The fear of the &amp;lt;span class=smcp&amp;gt;Lord&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; is a fountain of life,  
    that one may turn away from the snares of death. (Proverbs 14:26--27, ESV)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These verses remind me in the sharpest terms that fearing Yahweh is essential to
my own spiritual health and that of my family. Fearing him is confidence,
refuge, life, escape from the snares of death. What would it mean, then, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;
to fear God? And make no mistake: fear here is more than mere reverence. God is
holy, and his wrath burns hot against sin; we &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; fear him. Not in
contradistinction to loving him, though. Note that it is precisely in fearing
Yahweh that one has confidence and refuge and life and&amp;nbsp;salvation!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next one is of a rather different kind, but its anthropological theology is&amp;nbsp;striking:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Whoever oppresses a poor man insults his Maker,  
   but he who is generous to the needy honors him. (Proverbs 14:31, ESV)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God so cares about the poor, that to oppress poor people is to insult him. He so
loves the needy that being generous to them is to honor him. I think many
Christians who are both theologically and politically conservative fail to take
these kinds of words sufficiently seriously. Whatever the case may be for
others, I know &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; have failed to take them with all the gravity these words&amp;nbsp;carry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="striking-contrasts"&gt;Striking&amp;nbsp;contrasts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;The poor is disliked even by his neighbor,  
    but the rich has many friends.  
Whoever despises his neighbor is a sinner,  
    but blessed is he who is generous to the poor. (Proverbs 14:20-21, ESV)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first stanza is one of those straightforward, practical observations on the
way things are in this broken world. It is simply &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt; that people look down
on those who are poor, and that wealth earns friendship (of a sort). It is not
&lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; that this is so. But still it is so. The second stanza shows up this
reality for what it is, though: a reflection of a broken reality. The man who
scorns his neighbor&amp;#8212;no matter the cause, but as we have seen perhaps
&lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; if for poverty&amp;#8212;sins in doing so. The man who gives generously to
the poor is blessed. The contrast between the broken world in which we live and
the holy ways of God to which we are called could not be&amp;nbsp;clearer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, I am increasingly grateful for the Proverbs. I appreciate more and
more Solomon&amp;#8217;s (and others&amp;#8217;) skill in composing them, and the editor&amp;#8217;s skill in
arranging them so thoughtfully. Praise&amp;nbsp;God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:contrast?"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It strikes me that we evangelicals&amp;#8212;ever jetting between the
poles of abstruse dogmatics and applied pragmatics&amp;#8212;would do well to spend a
bit more time on the way the Proverbs marry the two.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:contrast?" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:justice"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be sure, this indicates flaws in our justice system, as well.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:justice" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

history. Of all the great turns in the march of God&amp;#8217;s plan, this one is right up
there with those that happened in the lives of Adam and Eve, Noah, Abraham, and
Moses. David brought the ark of the covenant to Jerusalem and instituted the
ritual&lt;sup id="fnref:ritual"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:ritual" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; of worship that was to characterize the place where God&amp;#8217;s
presence would dwell thenceforth&amp;#8212;a ritual that would produce many of the
psalms and that would shape the best of the life of faithful Hebrews for
generations to come. Then, Yahweh God blessed David with a covenant promise that
far exceeded anything David did (or could have done) for his&amp;nbsp;creator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is worth quoting Yahweh&amp;#8217;s promise to David at length, to see just how central
this promise was to be in the history of God&amp;#8217;s plan for saving the&amp;nbsp;world:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Moreover, I declare to you that the &lt;span class=smcp&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; will build
you a house.&lt;sup id="fnref:house"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:house" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; When your days are fulfilled to walk with your fathers, I
will raise up your offspring&lt;sup id="fnref:seed"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:seed" rel="footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; after you, one of your own sons, and I
will establish his kingdom. He shall build a house for me, and I will
establish his throne forever. I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me
a son. I will not take my steadfast love from him, as I took it from him who
was before you, but I will confirm him in my house and in my kingdom forever,
and his throne shall be stablished forever.&amp;#8221; (1 Chronicles&amp;nbsp;17:10b&amp;#8211;14)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of this finds its first fulfillment in David&amp;#8217;s son Solomon, of course.
Solomon built a temple for God, and Yahweh did fill it with his presence.
Solomon, despite his wandering ways, continued to receive the blessings of God.
However, even a casual reading of the rest of &lt;em&gt;this book&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8212;the Chronicles&amp;#8212;
immediately raises the question: How, exactly, will this promise be fulfilled if
the Davidic line of kings ended when the Jews were exiled to&amp;nbsp;Babylon?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New Testament makes it clear, of course: this promise finds its ultimately
fulfillment in Jesus Christ. The Messiah &lt;em&gt;fills up&lt;/em&gt; a promise that had its first
satisfaction in Solomon, but which was left unfinished in that king, great
though he was. Jesus is the king whose throne is and will be established
forever, from whom the Father&amp;#8217;s steadfast love with never be removed, and who
indeed &lt;a href="/2014/temple-for-god.html" title="A Temple For God"&gt;built a house&lt;/a&gt; for God.
Jesus is the one of whom the Father said, &amp;#8220;I will be to him a father, and he
will be to me a son&amp;#8221; (see Hebrews&amp;nbsp;1:5).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But of course, just as the Hebrews were waiting with longing for a Messiah to
come and fulfill this promise in the long years between the Exile and the coming
of Christ, so we are awaiting the Messiah&amp;#8217;s coming in these long years between
the Ascension and the Eschaton. The King is seated at the right hand of the
Majesty on high (Hebrews 1:3), but he has not yet come to claim the whole of his
kingdom. But in the interval, we follow David&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;lead:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Sing to the &amp;lt;span class=smcp&amp;gt;Lord&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;, all the earth!  
    Tell of his salvation from day to day.  
Declare his glory among the nations,  
    his marvelous works among all the peoples!  
For great is the &amp;lt;span class=smcp&amp;gt;Lord&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;, and greatly to be praised,  
    and he is to be held in awe above all gods.  
For all the gods of the peoples are idols,  
    but the &amp;lt;span class=smcp&amp;gt;Lord&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; made the heavens,  
Splendor and majesty are before him;  
    strength and joy are in his place.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hallelujah. Maranatha.&lt;sup id="fnref:maranatha"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:maranatha" rel="footnote"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:ritual"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Used here in the purely descriptive sense. Though we can all fall
into &lt;em&gt;dead&lt;/em&gt; ritual, where we practice the mere outward forms of things with no
motion of our will in line with the motions of our bodies, not all ritual is
dead. Nor is all ritual bad. When our worship is &lt;em&gt;reduced&lt;/em&gt; to ritual, we have a
problem, but ritual-less worship is anarchy and chaos at best.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:ritual" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:house"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m skipping over this for the sake of brevity, but I find it really
remarkable that when David plans to build God a house, God sends a prophet and
tells David, &amp;#8220;No, &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; am going to build &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; a house.&amp;#8221; Here is a small picture
of the gospel: God does for us what we are not worthy to do for him.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:house" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:seed"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Offspring&amp;#8221; here is the same word (&amp;#8220;seed&amp;#8221;) used in the promise that the
&amp;#8220;offspring&amp;#8221; of the woman would bruise the serpent&amp;#8217;s head and that the through
&amp;#8220;offspring&amp;#8221; of Abraham the nations would be blessed.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:seed" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:maranatha"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Come soon!&amp;#8221;&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:maranatha" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

piece, I am simply going to respond to a number of indidivual verses or
passages, and more briefly than usual. Sleep is calling, but diligence in
seeking God is a good I will not be quick to&amp;nbsp;overlook.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Whoever loves discipline hates knowledge  
    but he who hates reproof is stupid. (Proverbs 12:1, ESV)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It strikes me that this verse could serve as a heading for much of Proverbs, and
unfortunately for much of many of our lives. It is easy to hate reproof, because
it is easy to hate being wrong, because it is easy to be prideful and resistant
to&amp;nbsp;correction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Deceit is in the heart of the wicked,  
    but those who plan peace have joy. (Proverbs 12:20, ESV)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This verse&amp;#8212;and many like it throughout the Psalms&amp;#8212;makes it clear that the
&lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; things may contrast with wickedness. Though wickedness has a relatively
short list of characteristics in the Proverbs (murder and deception above all),
the things contrasted with the behavior of the wicked is nearly infinite. The
list includes wisdom, righteousness, peace, joy, and life, to name but a&amp;nbsp;few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Because the poor are plundered, because the needy groan,  
    "I will now arise," says the &amp;lt;span class=smcp&amp;gt;Lord&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;;  
    "I will place him in the saftey for which he longs."
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though I do not buy into &amp;#8220;liberation theology&amp;#8221;, thinking as I do that its
proponents tend to dramatically oversell their own case while ignoring entirely
the Biblical witness toward the individual nature of redemption and the salvific
work of Christ at Calvary, verses like this (and indeed: Psalms like this)
remind us that the liberation position &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; have something going for it.
Namely, it takes seriously something that Scripture takes seriously: God&amp;#8217;s
particular and especial concern for the poor and needy, not least those abused
by people with more power than them. We would do well to integrate this thread
more thoroughly into our evangelical conception of the world and our
responsibilities thereto. We need not diminish our clear proclamation of the
gospel nor mute our insistence on the centrality, supremacy, and sufficiency of
Christ in order to set our hands to work diligently for the good of the poor and
needy. We need not throw out penal substitutionary atonement to acknowledge that
God &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; show particular concern for the poor and&amp;nbsp;downtrodden.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chris Krycho</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jan 2014 23:30:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:www.chriskrycho.com,2014-01-12:2014/scriptural-miscellanies-jan-12-2014.html</guid><category>devotions</category></item><item><title>Prayer of Thanksgiving</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/prayer-thanksgiving-jan-12-2014.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Oh God&amp;#8212;our creator and father; our savior-king, lord, and friend; our helper, teacher, and comforter&amp;#8212;thank you for your unfailing love toward us. We marvel: you are the lord of light and of life, the maker of heaven and earth; you have set your glory above the heavens, and yet you are mindful of men and women like us. And not only mindful! You delight in us and love us in spite of our rebellion against you. You gave infinitely of yourself that we might be redeemed. Oh Lord, how majestic is your name in all the&amp;nbsp;earth!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we have gathered here to worship, and as we bring you these gifts, we remember that everything we give to you is yours already. You do not &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; anything of us; everything in all the world is yours already. All that we have we have from you&amp;#8212;not only our possessions, but even our lives&amp;#8212;so we pray that you be exalted in our giving, in our singing, and in the preached word. May we be those who in our giving gladly demonstrate that you are more precious to us than the things of this world. May Christ be exalted in our own hearts, in the work of this congregation, in the lives of the members of this church, in the community around us, and in the efforts of missionaries around the world as we give. Thank you so much for your steadfast love toward&amp;nbsp;us!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray all these things in the name of Jesus Christ our risen Lord.&amp;nbsp;Amen.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chris Krycho</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jan 2014 11:15:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:www.chriskrycho.com,2014-01-12:2014/prayer-thanksgiving-jan-12-2014.html</guid><category>prayers</category></item><item><title>Saul and David/Righteousness and Folly</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/saul-david-righteousness-folly.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;The books of Chronicles serve as something of a parallel and supplementary
account to the books of 1 and 2 Samuel and 1 and 2 Kings.&lt;sup id="fnref:kings"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:kings" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; There are a
few significant differences between the books, though. First, Samuel and Kings
take considerable time to trace out Saul&amp;#8217;s history and then divided their
attention fairly evenly between Judah and Israel, with a slight emphasis on
Israel because of Elijah and Elisha&amp;#8217;s ministries there. The Chronicles skip
almost entirely over Saul and focus predominantly on the Davidic line in&amp;nbsp;Judah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, Samuel and Kings generally let events speak for themselves, with little
commentary. Yahweh is always in control, but the author rarely provides explicit
theological interpretation of the events recorded. The Chronicles, rather
strikingly, &lt;em&gt;often&lt;/em&gt; make straightforward claims about divine action and provide
moral commentary on the events they record. After its long list of
&lt;a href="/theology/grappling-with-genealogies.html"&gt;genealogies&lt;/a&gt;, 1 Chronicles turns to
a narrative of the history of the Hebrews in the kingdom era, picking up with
Saul&amp;#8217;s death&amp;#8212;and immediately offers a theological interpretation of the events
(2 Samuel and 1 Kings simply report the events and a few people&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;responses):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Saul died for his breach of faith. he broke faith with the
&lt;span class=smcp&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; in that he did not keep the command of the
&lt;span class=smcp&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, and also consulted a medium, seeking guidance.
He did not seek guidance from the &lt;span class=smcp&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;. Therefore the
&lt;span class=smcp&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; put him to death and turned the kingdom over to
David the son of Jesse. (1 Chronicles 10:13&amp;#8211;14, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESV&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No ambiguity, no reason to misunderstand what happened. Kings made it clear by
literary structure. The Chronicles just come out and say it: Yahweh took the
kingdom away from Saul because he was unfaithful to him, and he gave it to a man
who&amp;#8212;whatever his faults, and they were indeed many&amp;#8212;would follow&amp;nbsp;Yahweh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Psalm 11, David evinces the very trust in Yahweh Saul lacked. He proclaims
his confidence that Yahweh will save him. To the warning that &amp;#8220;the wicked bend
the bow; / they have fitted their arrow to the string / to shoot in the dark at
the upright in heart&amp;#8221; (Psalm 11:2, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESV&lt;/span&gt;), David has a simple reply: &amp;#8220;The &lt;span
class=smcp&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; is in his holy temple; / the &lt;span
class=smcp&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8216;s throne is in heaven; his eyes
see, his eyelids test the children of man&amp;#8221; (Psalm 11:4, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESV&lt;/span&gt;). David&amp;#8217;s confidence
was not in his own strength. His hope was not in being free and clear of anyone
who would oppose him, but in the one whose throne is in heaven. Saul spent his
days troubled and afraid because he was never secure in&amp;nbsp;Yahweh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proverbs 11:28 (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESV&lt;/span&gt;)&amp;nbsp;comments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Whoever trusts in his riches will fall,  
    but the righteous will flourish like a green leaf.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole chapter resounds with the contrast between trust in riches or power or
mortal plans and righteousness. Righteousness, it seems, is in trusting and
obeying Yahweh. There is no righteousness that trusts in one&amp;#8217;s own strength.
There is only the righteousness &amp;#8220;which comes through faith in Christ, the
righteousness from God that depends on faith&amp;#8221; (Philippians 3:9, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESV&lt;/span&gt;). I am
reminded tonight not to trust in my own abilities, nor in the provision God has
given us,&lt;sup id="fnref:provision"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:provision" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; but in God&amp;nbsp;himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:kings"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally these four books were a single book, just as 1 and 2
Chronicles were a single book; it is rather unfortunate the modern divisions
obscure this.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:kings" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:provision"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What folly to put our trust in the material things we have, when
they are not ours save by the generous gift of God!&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:provision" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;a href="http://christianaudio.com"&gt;ChristianAudio.com&lt;/a&gt; is giving away the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESV&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#8220;Hear the
Word&amp;#8221; Audio Bible. Really, &lt;a href="http://christianaudio.com/free"&gt;for free&lt;/a&gt;. You give them an email
address, you get the whole Bible, read &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; well. I highly recommend that
you follow up on this, because it is normally not inexpensive, though even so a
good audio Bible is a very good investment. Now, back to the regularly scheduled&amp;nbsp;post.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="/2014/temple-for-god/"&gt;challenging&lt;/a&gt; as it can be to apply 2 Chronicles 1&amp;#8212;5
correctly, finding the substance in a passage like 1 Chronicles 1&amp;#8212;5 is even
harder, I think. The entire sequence is a list of names: fathers, sons,
occasional wives and daughters in the mix. Genealogies are one of the most
challenging sections in the Bible for Western readers, because they seem
enormously dry and pointless. (I saw a non-Christian comment on finding the
Bible incredibly boring the other day; I have no doubt that passaages like this
one contributed substantially to that assessment.) Truth be told, though I am
making a game effort at it, I still find these chapters difficult, too.[^sped-&amp;nbsp;up]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two things I hold onto as I consider these challenging chapters,
though. The first is Paul&amp;#8217;s affirmation that &amp;#8220;All Scripture is breathed out by
God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training
in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good
work&amp;#8221; (2 Timothy 3:16&amp;#8212;17, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESV&lt;/span&gt;). That &amp;#8220;all&amp;#8221; is important, because Paul included
1 Chronicles 1&amp;#8212;5 and Numbers 1 and Zechariah 4, challenging though they are in
their different ways. He did not exclude them because they might not make as
much sense to a future generation in another part of the world. Indeed, I would
go so far as to say that under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, Paul
explicitly affirmed the value of these books in part &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; they would be
foreign to&amp;nbsp;us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too often, we privilege our own cultural views as inherently correct in some
way. We assume that because genealogies do not matter &lt;em&gt;to us&lt;/em&gt;, they do not
matter &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt;. Few of us, it is true, would be so bold as to say this out
loud, but deep down, that is what we really believe. (For what we really believe
to be true is what drives our actions.) The presence of these lengthy
genealogies in the very word of God stands as a clear rebuke to our cultural
snobbery&amp;#8211;and to our chronological snobbery, too. These genealogies remind us
that we are not the first people in God&amp;#8217;s story, and that we will not be the
last. We are not the main characters in this narrative: even of those named in
these chapters, how many are familiar to us now?&lt;sup id="fnref:learned"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:learned" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; How many men and
women, faithful followers of God, simply go unnamed in these passages? Likewise,
who will know our names a thousand years hence, should the Lord&amp;nbsp;tarry?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This genealogy stands as a rebuke to our self-adulation and our emphasis on our
own value. It stands as a record of God&amp;#8217;s dealings with people who went long
before us, and thus as a testament to the historical character of God&amp;#8217;s salvific
work. It functions as a reminder that God&amp;#8217;s plan involves many a flawed hero,
and not a few villains. It points us back to the need for a king who would &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;
fit the pattern of all the kings named in this line. It highlights God&amp;#8217;s
faithfulness to keep his promises to Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, and to David,
even in the face of Israel&amp;#8217;s and Judah&amp;#8217;s rebellious ways. It ultimately points
us to God himself, the one constant in all these names and relationships. He
oversaw their history, as he oversees ours. We ought to reflect more often on
those who have gone before us in the faith, and to thank God for them and for
his work in history. We ought to be ever more dedicated to worshiping the God in
whose hands history flows like a&amp;nbsp;watercourse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:sped-up"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confession time: I put the &lt;a href="http://christianaudio.com/free"&gt;audio&lt;/a&gt; in 2&amp;times; mode
while I was listening to the latter parts of this section. It helped.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:sped-up" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:learned"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even having read through these chapters a number of times, it had
escaped me until tonight that David&amp;#8217;s generals, Joab, Asahel, and Abishai, were
his nephews&amp;#8211;the sons of his sister Zeruiah (see 1 Chronicles 2:16). This detail
sheds interesting light on many of their interactions, especially on David&amp;#8217;s
reticence to remove them from authority even when they were unruly. Yet it had
previously been lost on me entirely.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:learned" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chris Krycho</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2014 22:17:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:www.chriskrycho.com,2014-01-10:2014/grappling-with-genealogies.html</guid><category>devotions</category></item><item><title>A Temple for God</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/temple-for-god.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i class=editorial&gt;Note: today&amp;#8217;s comments are a bit out of order on the sequence
I&amp;#8217;ve been reading. I accidentally started &lt;em&gt;Second&lt;/em&gt; Chronicles rather than
&lt;em&gt;First&lt;/em&gt;. I&amp;#8217;ll go back and start with First Chronicles&amp;nbsp;tomorrow.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first blush, the first five chapters of 1 Chronicles do not seem to be
particularly scintillating material on the whole. Solomon&amp;#8217;s request for wisdom,
and God&amp;#8217;s answer, are notable, but otherwise the entire section is taken up by
details of the construction of the temple. It is at points like this that read-
the-Bible-in-a-year plans tend to get bogged down, and it is because of points
like this that most read-the-Bible-in-a-year plans include readings from the New
Testament as well as the Old. We struggle&amp;#8211;or at least, &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; have historically
struggled&amp;#8211;to make much of these passages. Why does it matter that there were
&amp;#8220;four hundred pomegranates for the two latticeworks, two rows of pomegranates
for each latticework, to cover the bowls of the capitals that were on top of the&amp;nbsp;pillars&amp;#8221;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I read the parallel passage in 1 Kings a little while back, it struck me that
what we have there&amp;#8212;and thus, also what we have here&amp;#8212;is enough information to
get a sense of the beauty and majesty of this building. The enormous quantitites
of precious metals that went into its construction, the attention paid to such
fine details of every single aspect of the building and its adornments, the
specially chosen timber brought in from a neighboring land: they all show us
that this temple was&amp;nbsp;magnificent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are not a temple-building people, and our monuments tend to be austere and
formal. Think of the Lincoln or Washington memorials in Washington, D. C.: they
are not exactly &lt;em&gt;lively&lt;/em&gt; places. Though celebratory and laudatory, they seek to
impress rather than to delight, focusing on clean, simple lines and shapes with
little ornamentation. The Solomonic temple, and before it the tabernacle, were
&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; like that. They were full of color and decoration, even as they were built
at striking physical scales. They were designed to engage every sense, sight and
smell especially. They were &lt;em&gt;beautiful&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So: beautiful the temple may have been. We are still left asking why the beauty
of a temple built in ancient Jerusalem almost three millennia ago matters to
Christians today. The answer, I think, lies in two passages in the New
Testament.&amp;nbsp;First:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So then you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are fellow citizens
with the saints and members of the household of God, built on the foundation
of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone, in
whom the whole structure, being joined together, grows into a holy temple in
the Lord. In him you also are being built together into a dwelling place for
God by the Spirit. (Ephesians 2:19-22, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESV&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And&amp;nbsp;again:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first
earth had passed away, and the sea was no more. And I saw the holy city, new
Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for
her husband. And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, &amp;#8220;Behold, the
dwelling place of God is with man. He will dwell with them, and they will be
his people, and God himself will be with them as their God. He will wipe away
every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be
mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed&amp;nbsp;away.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he who was seated on the throne said, &amp;#8220;Behold, I am making all things&amp;nbsp;new&amp;#8230;.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I saw no temple in the city, for its temple is the Lord God the Almighty
and the Lamb. And the city has no need of sun or moon to shine on it, for the
glory of God gives it light, and its lamp is the Lamb. (Revelation 20:1&amp;#8212;5,&amp;nbsp;22&amp;#8212;23)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you see? As magnificent and beautiful as that old temple was, it has been
supplanted. The &lt;em&gt;church&lt;/em&gt; is the temple, a dwelling place for God that is yet
more beautiful. People are more stunning than the loveliest stones. And there
will come a day when the dwelling place of God is with man, not only in spirit
but in physical, at th econsummation of all things. That temple, filled as it
was with the awesome presence of God, was but the tiniest taste of &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; age,
when God indwells every believer. And this age is but the tiniest taste of
&lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; age, when the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb come down from heaven
and make their dwelling place with&amp;nbsp;man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hallelujah. Our Lord,&amp;nbsp;come!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chris Krycho</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jan 2014 07:45:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:www.chriskrycho.com,2014-01-09:2014/temple-for-god.html</guid><category>devotions</category></item><item><title>Out of the Mouths of Poets</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/mouths-of-poets.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, the core idea of a passage&amp;#8211;especially when in poetic forms like in
the Psalms&amp;#8211;cannot be understood apart from the structure of the passage itself.
Tonight I was reading Psalm 8, and thinking about the aims of reading the Bible.
Specifically, my aim is to know God and worship him more as I read Scripture.
Thus, my goal is that each time I read through a section I would come away both
more aware of who God is and more set in both my will and my
affections&lt;sup id="fnref:affections"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:affections" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to honor&amp;nbsp;him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I read Psalm 8, I was wondering, &amp;#8220;Okay, how does this lead me to worship?&amp;#8221;
Echoing the psalm is a good start, of course, as it opens and&amp;nbsp;closes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh Yahweh, our Lord,&lt;br /&gt;
how majestic is your name in all the&amp;nbsp;earth!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the rest of the psalm is a meditation not only on Yahweh&amp;#8217;s majesty, but on
the people he made. This is an interesting turn, and it caught me off guard as I
started thinking more carefully about it. The key, I soon realized, is in the
fact that this is a Psalm, not a letter or a sermon or a treatise. David felt
free to get at his point sideways, as it were, and as is the fashion of&amp;nbsp;poetry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole poem turns back and forth between the God who made the heavens, who
set his glory above them, and the people he made. The contrast is striking, and
the more so because of the wonderful turns of&amp;nbsp;phrase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I look at your heavens, the work of your fingers,&lt;br /&gt;
the moon and the stars, which you have set in place,&lt;br /&gt;
what is man that you are mindful of him,&lt;br /&gt;
and the son of man that you care for&amp;nbsp;him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I can sum up the point David is making here. One could say simply, &amp;#8220;Humans
are small compared to the universe, so it is surprising that God would pay
attention to them.&amp;#8221;  But to do so without further reflection is to miss some of
the beauty of what David does in the &lt;em&gt;poetry&lt;/em&gt;, and therefore to miss the force
of the passage. It is to miss an opportunity to have my emotions interact with
this truth, and not only my mind. We have all felt the awe of staring at a night
sky full of lights, a billion miles away and burning brighter than our own sun
so that we can see them here across the aeons. We have all felt small against
that&amp;nbsp;vastness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if we stop for a moment and feel that here with David, and then are caught
by the sudden turn&amp;#8212;&amp;#8221;what is man?&amp;#8221;&amp;#8212;we can feel with him the wonder that the
God who set his glory above the heavens is the God who gave man dominion over
creation. We can feel with him the surprise that God would not only establish
his strength before the nations and before those who rebel against him, but that
he would do it through babies and infants. We can feel with him the greatness of
a God who is not limited by our feeble strength and our mortality, whose majesty
goes beyond the tinyness of humanity and yet is somehow the greater for the ways
he uses us, little beings that we&amp;nbsp;are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How majestic is the name of Yahweh in all the earth,&amp;nbsp;indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:affections"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My desires, ambitions, emotions&amp;#8211;all the pieces of me that
include but are not limited to my thoughts and feelings, and which are distinct
from though closely interacting with my will.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:affections" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chris Krycho</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 08 Jan 2014 22:37:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:www.chriskrycho.com,2014-01-08:2014/mouths-of-poets.html</guid><category>devotions</category></item><item><title>A Study in Contrasts: 2 Kings 16–20</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/study-in-contrasts-2-kings-16-20.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;One of the recurring themes of the books of Kings (1 and 2 Samuel, 1 and 2
Kings) is the distinction between those who &amp;#8220;did what was right in the eyes of
Yahweh&amp;#8221; and those who &amp;#8220;did what was evil in the sight of Yahweh&amp;#8221;, e.g. 15:34,
17:2 respectively&amp;#8211;to name just two of the &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; passages echoing this refrain
in these books. Whereas 1 and 2 Samuel zoomed in on the contrast between Saul
and David, 1 and 2 Kings take nearly all their successors at a very high level,
often sparing them few more words than necessary to note their parentage,
whether they did what was right or what was evil in the eyes of Yahweh, and a
reference to other records of their&amp;nbsp;deeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the dominant themes of these books, then, is that doing what is right in
Yahweh&amp;#8217;s eyes has an enormous reward, while doing what is evil in his eyes
eventually brings a great judgment. 2 Kings 17&amp;#8212;19 brings this message home,
and hard. Centuries of rebellion on Israel&amp;#8217;s part culminated in the Assyrian
capture of Samaria and the forcible exile of the Jews of Israel from their
homeland. The author pauses from his otherwise quick-moving narrative to explain
this point in detail for the better part of a chapter. Israel&amp;#8217;s fall was not the
mere ordinary turn of regional political events it might have seemed. It was,
instead, God&amp;#8217;s final judgment on a people who had continuously rebelled against
him generation after generation, worshiping in a way they &lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt; was abhorrent
to&amp;nbsp;him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contrast, when the same mighty king with his mighty army came to take
Jerusalem, the city stood. Judah had its share of wicked kings, to be sure&amp;#8211;but
unlike Israel, it also had many kings who &amp;#8220;did what was right in the eyes of
Yahweh&amp;#8221; and in particular it had Hezekiah, who &amp;#8220;trusted in Yahweh, the God of
Israel, so that there was none like him among all the kings of Judah after him,
nor among those who were before him&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;(18:5).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The armies of the greatest power in the region&amp;#8211;unstoppable Assyria&amp;#8211;surrounded
the capital city en masse. Their leaders boasted in their victories, tried to
bully Hezekiah and the people into surrendering without a fight, and insulted
the name of Yahweh. Attacking the people of God is always a bad idea; attacking
him directly is an even &lt;em&gt;worse&lt;/em&gt; idea. The Scriptures are a long record of the
lengths to which God will go to defend his name: he will quite literally die to
defend the glorious reality that he is most righteous and most powerful being
there is, most worthy of worship. When Sennacherib boasted, &amp;#8220;Who among all the
gods of the lands have delivered their lands out of my hand, that Yahweh should
deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?&amp;#8221; (18:35), he missed something. Hezekiah points
it out in his prayer: &amp;#8220;[They] were not gods, but the work of men&amp;#8217;s hands, wood
and stone. Therefore they were destroyed. So now, O Yahweh our God, save us,
please, from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you, O
Yahweh, are God alone&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;(19:18b&amp;#8212;29).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God has &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; been about the business of making his name known to the ends of
the earth. Not because he is a braggart, but because he is the end for which all
things exist&amp;#8211;the end for which &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; exist. In setting ourselves against that,
we are setting ourselves against reality. We are trying to fly by pushing away
from the ground with the hairs on our head&amp;#8211;and for some reason, gravity comes
out victorious. So when God brings judgment on blasphemers, that is a &lt;em&gt;mercy&lt;/em&gt; to
the nations who have a chance to repent and kneel before the king of&amp;nbsp;all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is amazing to me is just how profoundly longsuffering God is. Were I so
often insulted, ignored, and injuriously assaulted in character, I would not
wait hundreds of years, sending prophet after prophet to give people opportunity
after opportunity to respond. I sometimes have a hard time restraining my
impatience for a few minutes with my wife or my child. And yet the God who
ultimately struck down 185,000 Assyrians waited generation upon generation to
bring his judgment on Israel&amp;#8211;and he likewise gave the Assyrians the opportunity
to repent (c.f. Jonah). This God is shockingly merciful, even as he brings&amp;nbsp;judgment.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chris Krycho</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jan 2014 23:40:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:www.chriskrycho.com,2014-01-07:2014/study-in-contrasts-2-kings-16-20.html</guid><category>devotions</category></item><item><title>Five Things Proverbs 6 Teaches</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/five-things-proverbs-six.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Proverbs 6 makes 5 points, rather distinctly and sharply. First a summary and
then a few thoughts on&amp;nbsp;each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verses 1&amp;#8211;5:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Being security for your neighbor&amp;#8212;still less for a
   stranger&amp;#8212;is a bad&amp;nbsp;idea.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This first point is perhaps the least obviously applicable to me today. I
don&amp;#8217;t make a habit of pledging money or possessions for a friend&amp;#8217;s (still
less a stranger&amp;#8217;s) poor money decisions. I might &lt;em&gt;give&lt;/em&gt; a friend (or even a
stranger) money, but I can&amp;#8217;t imagine putting myself in the position of
guaranteeing a loan for someone else. That just seems like a terrible idea.
Of course, that&amp;#8217;s the point of these verses: it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a terrible idea. The
counsel here is to get out of that kind of situation as fast as possible
(and, by implication, to avoid getting into such a situation in the first&amp;nbsp;place).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verses 6&amp;#8211;11:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Laziness will prove ruinous. Industriousness will produce
   good&amp;nbsp;results.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have seen this proven true time and again in the lives of those around me.
As a general rule, people who work hard do well for themselves, and people
who are lazy do very poorly for themselves. As a rule, I say, because there
are times when this is not true&amp;#8212;there really are times when systemic
injustices undermine even people&amp;#8217;s best efforts. This proverb is a proverb,
not an iron-clad guarantee, and we would all do well to remember as much.
That said: we would &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; do well to remember as much: if the political
conservative&amp;#8217;s typical response is to simply point to this verse as a
promise (which it is not), the political liberal&amp;#8217;s typical response is to
act as though this verse has no bearing whatsoever. Sometimes, poverty has
complex, structural, societal roots&amp;#8212;but sometimes, people are just lazy.
God calls us &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to be lazy; work is a good thing that was instituted
before the&amp;nbsp;Fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verses 12&amp;#8211;15:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;The ultimate fate of a wicked person is&amp;nbsp;calamity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is nothing terribly complicated here. There is, however, a great deal
of hope here for those of us who have watched wicked people go around
behaving wickedly and seemingly coming off no worse for wear every time.
There will come a day of recompense for every wicked deed. Lord willing, for
some of those people, that day came when Christ came, and they will join us
in the company of saints as they abandon their wickedness and turn to God.
But for those who don&amp;#8217;t, justice will come, and it will come&amp;nbsp;swiftly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verses 16&amp;#8211;19:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;There are some things God truly&amp;nbsp;hates.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is almost &lt;em&gt;passe&lt;/em&gt; to note how distasteful this idea is in our culture
today, but the words on the page could not be clearer. There are things that
Yahweh hates, things that are an abomination to him. He hates pride. He
abominates deceit. He hates the shedding of innocent blood. He abominates
the plotting of wickedness. He hates the doing of evil. He abominates false
witness to be borne. He hates dissension between&amp;nbsp;brothers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But more than this: he hates those who &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; these things. This is dreadful
&amp;#8212;apart from the grace he shows us in&amp;nbsp;Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verses 20&amp;#8211;35:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Adultery is folly. Wisdom runs the other&amp;nbsp;way.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/2014/01/folly-of-sin"&gt;Once again&lt;/a&gt;, the proverbs hammer home the folly of
adultery. It is not only that it does not give what it promises and brings
spiritual ruin. It is that it also produces, at a purely practical level,
destruction. A spouse&amp;#8217;s jealousy is (rightly) a fearful thing. Who in his
right mind would sleep with another man&amp;#8217;s wife, knowing what the response
would be? What woman would sleep with another woman&amp;#8217;s husband, knowing how
her own rage would be? The implications just for one&amp;#8217;s own health&amp;#8212;still
less any other part of one&amp;#8217;s life&amp;#8212;ought to be enough to warn us&amp;nbsp;away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Proverbs remind me again and again that God cares about my life at every
level. He is not distant or unengaged with these details; he cares about every
aspect of human flourishing, and takes pains to make clear to us what that
flourishing looks like&amp;#8212;and what it&amp;nbsp;doesn&amp;#8217;t.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chris Krycho</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jan 2014 20:30:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:www.chriskrycho.com,2014-01-06:2014/five-things-proverbs-six.html</guid><category>devotions</category></item><item><title>The Folly of Sin</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/folly-of-sin.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Adultery. It has torn countless families and destroyed innumerable ministries
over the years. Over and over again, the refrain is the same: &amp;#8220;I never thought
it would happen to me!&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;I never meant for it to go this far!&amp;#8221;&lt;sup id="fnref:adultery-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:adultery-1" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
Given the evidence of the years, though, no one should ever cavalierly say,
&amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;ll never do that.&amp;#8221; Say it, yes. But back it up by making concrete choices
every day not to break vows to your&amp;nbsp;spouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proverbs 5 couldn&amp;#8217;t be clearer: adultery &lt;em&gt;looks&lt;/em&gt; good from the outside and feels
good at the&amp;nbsp;outset:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;For the lips of a forbidden woman drip honey,
    and her speech is smoother than oil,
but in the end she is bitter as wormwood,
    sharp as a two-edged sword.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one commits adultery because it looks so dreadful. People commit this sin&amp;#8212;
like every other&amp;#8212;because it looks good. The trick, of course, is that it is
&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;. The Proverb highlights the contradiction of sin powerfully: sin looks
sweet, but proves bitter. It seems smooth, but only proves smoothly destructive
as it slices away at everything you value. Sin always produces the opposite of
what it promises. Adultery promises intimacy, but adultery &lt;em&gt;destroys&lt;/em&gt; intimacy.
Drugs promise liberated minds; instead they produce addiction. Covetousness
promises satisfaction; instead it produces only an ever-gnawing emptiness. Sin
is like a sweet-tasting infection that rots us from the inside&amp;nbsp;out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it is more than that. Sin is not bad only because it proves so ruinous to us
&amp;#8212;though certainly it is bad for that reason. Sin is bad because it is high
treason, because it is at its core a rejection of the good, the true, the
beautiful in that it is a rejection of God in the exaltation of self. Sin is
ruinous to us in part because it is the undoing of everything of what we are:
beings made to worship the Triune God, instead kneeling to our own reflection in
the mirror instead of the one we were meant to&amp;nbsp;reflect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But God is a righteous judge. He is holy. He does not tolerate sin. Psalm 5 puts
it in sharp&amp;nbsp;relief:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;For you are not a God who delights in wickedness;
    evil may not dwell with you.
The boastful shall not stand before your eyes;
    you hate all evildoers.
You destroy those who speak lies;
    Yahweh abhors the bloodthirsty and deceitful man.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God detests sin.&lt;sup id="fnref:sin-sermon"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:sin-sermon" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Not just the hot-button sin issues of our day
(though those are not excluded), but our pettiness and jealousy, our deceptions
great and small, our boasting and pride. We are &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; evildoers. And yet, wonder
of wonders, we live still. Though God who made us and at whom we have all shaken
our fists in rebellion would be perfectly within his rights to end us without a
thought; he does not. He shows mercy. He forbears long. He waits to bring&amp;nbsp;judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He provides a way of escape. We, like David, can enter his house &amp;#8220;through the
abundance of [his] steadfast love.&amp;#8221; That steadfast love, that covenant love,
that almight love, has reached down and partaken of frail humanity and death and
even of divine wrath, so that God might be glorified in his holiness. We are
saved not because God is sentimental or sappy, but because he is righteous, and
has already paid the price for our&amp;nbsp;sins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hallelujah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:adultery-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yes, sometimes also (even more sadly), &amp;#8220;I don&amp;#8217;t care; why
shouldn&amp;#8217;t I be happy?&amp;#8221;&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:adultery-1" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:sin-sermon"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more on all of this, I commend to you the &lt;a href="http://www.sermonaudio.com/sermoninfo.asp?sermonID=15141146471"&gt;sermon&lt;/a&gt;

Elisha echo Moses and foreshadow the Messiah. They perform miracles that show up
the limitations of other so-called deities, part the Jordan, make clean what was
impure, give miraculous children, raise the dead, multiply food for a meal for
the hungry.&lt;sup id="fnref:bears"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:bears" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; These men were prophets like Moses, but Israel knew that
they were not &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; prophet like Moses that the first savior of Israel had&amp;nbsp;promised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading through these books, it is interesting that Israel was eagerly awaiting
another prophet like Elijah when Jesus came. Indeed, it is interesting that a
later prophet would speak of Elijah coming again. Reading through this material
&amp;#8212;which was originally all a single book covering all of 1 Samuel through 2
Kings&amp;#8212;one would not necessarily be inclined to call Elijah the greater of the
pair. Indeed, Elisha both asked for and apparently received a double portion of
the miraculous gift that Yahweh had given to Elijah. The text records far more
miracles performed by Elisha than by Elijah. (Indeed, most of that list above
belongs to Elisha and not to&amp;nbsp;Elijah.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, though, there was something special about&amp;nbsp;Elijah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it was his passion for the name of Yahweh, and I think the text makes
this abundantly clear. It is not that Elisha was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; passionate for the glory
of Yahweh; it is that this is the main (and nearly the only) thing in view in
Elijah&amp;#8217;s ministry. Elijah&amp;#8217;s responsibility was to point the people to repentance
for their sins and to show up false religion for what it was. This he did. He
stood for the name of Yahweh under the threat of death and all alone. Other
faithful Yahweh-worshippers though there were in Israel at the time, it was
Elijah alone on the mountain confronting the four hundred priests of Baal, and
he alone who saw the mighty hand of Yahweh raised in triumph against Baalism.
He, like John the Baptizer, was the lone voice in the wilderness, calling the
people of Israel back to&amp;nbsp;God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elisha&amp;#8217;s role was different: he was the man of miracles and the fierce judge. He
did the greatest miracles recorded in the Bible prior to the coming of the
Messiah; only in Jesus himself was there a greater provider, healer, or
resurrector. He pointed to the greatness of Yahweh through these miracles;
unlike Elijah, he did so in a time when many others worshipped Yahweh. He stood
on Elijah&amp;#8217;s shoulders, as it&amp;nbsp;were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have often pondered over the last year or so that often it is the case that
younger leaders can seem (and perhaps are) more effective than their elders&amp;#8212;
but that even when this is so, there is a foundation present &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; of the
elders that is too easily overlooked. Many young men&amp;#8217;s pastoral ministries are
successful not only because of their own faithfulness, but because of the work
of the pastors who preceded them. Many young men can be more doctrinally sound
than or more effective preachers than their predecessors &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; of their
predecessors. Elisha did his miracles in a land that had already seen Baalism
humbled under fire from Yahweh. I do my writing, ministry (such as it is), and
even thinking in the context set for me by faithful Christians who have gone
before, women and men who have diligently sought Christ and laid a foundation on
which I might&amp;nbsp;build.&lt;/p&gt;

Scripture reading is asking one simple question as I read: &lt;em&gt;What does this
passage reveal about God?&lt;/em&gt; There are many other questions&amp;#8212;good, important
questions&amp;#8212;to ask of the text. But this one, I find, yields the most fruit. The
Bible is not just a book of moral teachings, nor a mere practical guide for our
lives. It is the revelation of the living God to his people.&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what do we do when we get to, say, Proverbs? At first blush, the question
seems a good deal less tractable here than in many other places. However hairy,
most narratives &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; show us the character of God. Propositional content,
whether in letters or sermons or parables or prophecies, likewise tends to make
clear, succinct statements about the person and nature of God. The Proverbs,
though? Well, sometimes they do, and sometimes they say things like, &amp;#8220;Do not
contend with a man for no reason, when he has done you no harm.&amp;#8221; That&amp;#8217;s helpful,
to be sure, but when you first read it, it&amp;#8217;s not obvious how that gets us back
to God. We could try to hammer the Proverbs into some framework for
understanding God, try to reduce their presence in the canon to a role in some
theme or another.&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In the end, though, any such reductive effort is going to
run aground on the shoals of misunderstanding&amp;#8212;quite the opposite of the intent
of the&amp;nbsp;author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Proverbs often show us God&amp;#8217;s character sideways. If we believe that the
counsel offered by the Proverbs really is wise&amp;#8212;that the glowing promises here
in Proverbs 3 of blessing, gain, and profit from wisdom are true, that there
really is nothing better than to have understanding&amp;#8212;then we believe that they
are insights into reality. And reality was made &lt;em&gt;by God&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Yahweh by wisdom founded the earth;
    by understanding he established the heavens;
by his knowledge the deeps broke open,
    and the clouds drop down the dew. (Proverbs 3:19--20)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we then start asking good questions of the text we find very quickly that we
do have a path back to the person and nature of God. For example: &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; should
we not contend with a man when he has done us no harm? Well, we ought not do so
because it will certainly stir up trouble, and we know God does not delight in
strife. Moreover, picking a fight with someone without cause is unjust, and this
same author has told us that wisdom comports with justice and righteousness, and
that &lt;em&gt;God&lt;/em&gt; is&amp;nbsp;just.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking a further step back, we can ask why this proverb is included in the
inspired Scriptures. Then we see even more: God cares about the way people
interact with one another. He values human flourishing, and so has provided
enormous guidance for us in the form of hundreds upon hundreds of practical
insights into the way the world is. He delights in people so greatly that he
crosses the boundary between transcendence and immanence to give us his very&amp;nbsp;words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out there is an awful lot to learn about God in the Proverbs&amp;#8212;even the
ones that do no mention&amp;nbsp;him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That final phrase, &amp;#8220;to his people,&amp;#8221; is an important one for all
hermeneutics; reading the Scriptures with faith makes a difference. &lt;a href="http://mereorthodoxy.com/"&gt;Matthew Lee
Anderson&lt;/a&gt; makes this point helpfully and at some length in his excellent
&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/End-Our-Exploring-Questioning-Confidence-ebook/dp/B00BUP1BQQ/?tag=krycho-20"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The End of Our Exploring&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is right here that many Biblical theologies&amp;#8212;that&amp;#8217;s a specific
discipline in theology, though admittedly poorly named&amp;#8212;go amiss.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chris Krycho</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jan 2014 23:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:www.chriskrycho.com,2014-01-03:2014/finding-god-proverbs.html</guid><category>devotions</category></item><item><title>Kings in Contrast</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/kings-contrast.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight&amp;#8217;s reading in 1 Kings, Psalms, and Proverbs had some surprising overlaps.
The material in 1 Kings covered a series of kings whose courses were largely
&lt;em&gt;away&lt;/em&gt; from worshipping Yahweh and toward worshipping other gods. With only one
exception, in fact, every single king listed in these five chapters rejected the
God of Israel in favor of the gods of the nations which the Hebrews had driven
out of Canaan. That exception, Asa, stands in sharp contrast to the litany of
rebellious kings who preceded and followed him as being a man who followed God
with his whole heart. Others, it seems, included Yahweh in their list of gods to
worship, but never reverenced him as supreme and only. This list of wicked kings
of both Israel and Judah climaxes with the appearance of Elijah, the righteous
prophet who confronts the &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; wicked king in the list, and who ultimately
demonstrates Yahweh&amp;#8217;s superiority over the other gods the Hebrews&amp;nbsp;worshipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proverbs 2 continues Solomon&amp;#8217;s exhortation to seek wisdom wholeheartedly, and
his corresponding encouragement that Yahweh gives wisdom to those who seek it.
But Solomon did not stop with the idea that knowledge and understanding are good
&amp;#8212;though this he certainly affirms. Rather, he continued on to emphasize that
God&amp;#8217;s knowledge and discernment go hand in hand with his integrity and justice.
Those who seek this wisdom walk in righteousness and justice and equity. A
person of wisdom is kept safe from both evildoers and from doing evil him- or
herself. That Solomon&amp;#8217;s own line, beginning with his own son and continuing on
down through every king but Asa in these chapters in 1 Kings, went so far astray
indicates how little these words were&amp;nbsp;heeded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The picture painted by Psalm 2 stands in impossibly sharp contrast to these
depraved kings. The Anointed One of the psalm is a messianic figure: those who
take refuge in him find shelter, but those who rebel against him are broken
under his rule. There is a king in view here who laughs at the rebellion of the
rulers of every nation (Israel included), who scorns the folly of plotting
against the Most High God. The king that Yahweh calls his Son will receive those
same nations as his inheritance. He will be the king above all other kings. He
will be both wrathful against rebellion and merciful to those who &amp;#8220;take refuge
in him&amp;#8221; (v.&amp;nbsp;11&amp;#8211;12).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we have set before us the history of wicked men rebelling against the very
God who gave them their thrones, and a call to that same line of the kings to
humbly seek wisdom from that God, and a poetic picture of the true king against
whom any rebellion is folly. And running through all of these are both the wrath
of God against the folly and sin of those rebelling against him, and his mercy.
Yahweh saves his people from following other gods in that magnificent
confrontation on the mountain, Elijah on one side and the priests of Baal on the
other. He is the source of wisdom, and the one who keeps his people from walking
in folly or wickedness. And he is the righteous king who gives his people peace
and security. Not because he does not do justice or cares little about sin, but
precisely &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; he does justice and cares about sin. That Anointed One, that
Son of the Most High, is Jesus Christ, who died in order that everything would
be put under his feet. Every wicked king in 1 Kings points to the need for
Jesus. He is the fulfillment of the wisdom promised in Proverbs 2. He is the
Anointed One, the Son of Yahweh, who reigns the nations in righteousness.&amp;nbsp;Hallelujah.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chris Krycho</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jan 2014 21:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:www.chriskrycho.com,2014-01-02:2014/kings-contrast.html</guid><category>devotions</category></item><item><title>A New Year of Devotions</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/new-year-devotions.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I have found, over the years, that writing is a remarkably helpful tool for
thinking through the things I am learning. I have also found that I am often
better able to remain consistent in my study of Scripture if I am writing
regularly about it. That could be in a journal, or on a blog, or just about
anywhere. In 2014, I am going to experiment with posting this writing on my blog
&amp;#8212;something I have done &lt;a href="http://2012-2013.chriskrycho.com/theology/topics/devotions/index.html"&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;
to good effect for myself, and which a number of acquaintances seemed to like.
After talking it through with my wonderful wife, I have set myself a limit of
half an hour &lt;em&gt;total&lt;/em&gt; devoted to writing these posts. Hopefully it will prove&amp;nbsp;profitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it seems like 1 Kings 9&amp;#8211;13 is a funny place to start this sort of thing,
that&amp;#8217;s because it is. But 1 Kings is where I am, and thus it is the place from
which I will continue&amp;#8212;I do not see a good reason to start over at the
beginning &lt;em&gt;again&lt;/em&gt; just a few months after having done so&amp;nbsp;before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of points stuck out at me as I worked through this passage. First, and
most important, is one of the recurring themes of the whole book: the question
of obedience to Yahweh,&lt;sup id="fnref:yahweh"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:yahweh" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and the consequences of rejecting him. From the
promise God offers Solomon  in chapter 9 through the death of a prophet in
chapter 13, the issue is clear. Obedience to God brings everlasting favor, and
disobedience brings&amp;nbsp;death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not exactly a new theme for the Bible as a whole: it shows up all the
way back in Genesis 3. Nor does it stop here (nor even under the New Covenant
with Christ): submission to God is characteristic of all who believe. Why? Not
because God is some cruel dictator, but because he is both omniscient and
omnibenevolent. He knows what is best for us. Defying his ways is like defying
gravity: it might make for a &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlMBcTGJ4YM&amp;amp;name=DefyingGravity"&gt;catchy
tune&lt;/a&gt;, but the
net result is always crashing hard to the&amp;nbsp;ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So: Yahweh promised Solomon great things if he would simply follow him alone and
not worship other gods. Solomon did exactly the opposite of what God had
commanded the kings of Israel, though: he married multiple foreign women who
themselves worshiped other gods,&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and ultimately he built altars to and
sacrificed to those other gods himself. We see the same thing in Jeroboam&amp;#8217;s
life: God made him promises of really marvelous import, if he would simply walk
with Yahweh. Instead, as soon as he became king he led the people &lt;em&gt;away&lt;/em&gt; from
Yahweh, reasoning that Yahweh-worship was a threat to his own power, even though
it was a prophet of Yahweh who had first told him all that would happen and that
it was Yahweh who would do it. A righteous prophet ends up dead because he
disobeyed God&amp;#8217;s clear&amp;nbsp;instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short: God means business, and we ought to pay attention when he commands us
in a certain area. Again, not because he is a tyrant, but because he loves us
and he is righteous. When we defy him, we are simultaneously wronging ourselves
and committing cosmic treason. It&amp;#8217;s a bad move, and he rightly responds in
judgment. That, in turn, though, takes me back to his &lt;em&gt;decisive&lt;/em&gt; act of
judgment: the one the Godhead executed on itself, in the sacrificial, atoning
death of Christ on my behalf. My motivation for obedience, then, is not only
fear, but joyful&amp;nbsp;gratitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a good start to the&amp;nbsp;year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:yahweh"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know it is a bit unusual to spell out the name of God used in the
Old Testament like this, but it is my preference. I think it makes many passages
much clearer to read Yahweh instead of &lt;span style="font-variant: small-
caps"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, and it&amp;#8217;s simply what&amp;#8217;s there in the original (even if the
Jews historically have chosen not to say it&amp;#8212;there&amp;#8217;s something interesting
here, but I shall pass over it today).&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:yahweh" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the reason for the prohibition on marrying foreigners was always
religious, not ethnic. Solomon&amp;#8217;s own lineage (and thus, Jesus&amp;#8217; too) includes
several foreign women&amp;#8212;each of whom worshiped Yahweh.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
