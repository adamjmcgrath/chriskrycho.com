Good day (or evening, as the case may be), and welcome to my home on the
interwebs!

If you've just stumbled onto this site from a bleary-eyed tumble through the
wild wastes of the web, and have no idea who I am, this page will get you
started. If you're already familiar with my particular quirks, oddities,
interests, and hobbies, feel free to hop right on into whichever of the site's
sections you came here seeking.

Otherwise, a few words of introduction are likely in order. I am first of all a
Christ-follower, a husband, a happy father of two little girls (one toddling
around happily and the other still snuggled up in her mothers womb). I am also
in pursuit of the Master of Divinity degree at [Southeastern Baptist Theological
Seminary](http://www.sebts.edu/) in Wake Forest, North Carolina,[^nc] and a
software developer and web designer.

I am a Colorado native, and the mountains make my soul sing.[^sing] I had the
pleasure of earning a bachelor's degree in physics from the University of
Oklahoma---where I also took the rough equivalent of a minor in music
composition from a school that does not offer music minors[^minor]. There I had
the pleasure of meeting my wife Jaimie, who blogs [here][jaimie] from time to
time and posts fiction [here][fiction] from time to time. There, our first
daughter was born: Elayne Kaylee.[^ok] In 2013, we moved to North Carolina, a
land we have been happy to call home ever since.

When I am not busy studying biblical languages or theology, you can often find
me writing,[^writing] running (I am a half marathoner, which is not the same as
half a marathoner), playing Ultimate, rereading _The Lord of the Rings_ again,
watching _Doctor Who_ or _Castle_ or _Firefly_ with Jaimie, playing Ultimate,
working on my [podcast][ws],  or---very occasionally, when the stars align just
right---[composing][soundcloud].

Please take a gander at the various things I've written, and feel free to
contact me in any of the sundry media I have listed in the "Contact" section
below.

- [Art](/art/)
- [Technology](/tech/)
- [Theology](/theology/)
- [Blog posts](/blog/) -- a catchall for otherwise uncategorized posts,
  including family, miscellaneous projects, etc.

To see all of these in one place, take a look at the [archives](/archives/).
Enjoy your stay and try not to get too lost.

[^nc]: A land I am happy to call my home. More on that in a moment. Yes, you can
    expect footnotes to be a regular occurence even on standalone pages. I'm
    *that* kind of guy.

[^sing]: My wife will attest to the singing, and also affirm that said singing
    is usually loud. Worry not: I have no intent to post recordings of such
    things.

[^minor]: Some might call this masochistic. I called it *fun*.

[^ok]: There, I had the corresponding <del>displeasure</del> *sanctifying
    challenge* of living in Oklahoma for seven and a half years. Oklahoma is
    almost totally flat, often quite brown, and its citizens think tornados are
    fun. They're great people, really! But the state was not so much to my
    liking as was my previous or as is my current abode. I need hills, and
    better yet mountains, and I can do without the constant threat of tornadoes.
    At least here I have some warning when the hurricanes are coming!

    Also, I think I shall make this the last footnote: I am getting a bit
    carried away.

[^writing]: Writing *lots*. Just look around at this site. You'll see what I
    mean in short order. And yes, I know I just wrote another footnote.

    Does it make it any better that I started planning this footnote immediately
    after penning the last one, just for humor's sake?
