<div class="epigraph">For He was made man that we might be made God; and He manifested Himself by a body that we might receive the idea of the unseen Father; and He endured the insolence of men that we might inherit immortality.&emsp;&mdash;St. Athanasius, <cite>On the Incarnation</cite></div>
<h2 id="a-mistake">A&nbsp;Mistake</h2>
<p>It has been common, these past few years, to speak of &#8220;incarnational theology&#8221;
as a way of describing the Christian mission to the world. We ought to live as
Christ&#8217;s body, we are told, &#8220;incarnating&#8221; Christ to the world as Christ
&#8220;incarnated&#8221; the Godhead to us. There is much to appreciate in this sentiment.
In many ways, it represents a wholly appropriate recognition that humans are
image-bearers and that as Christians one of our roles is to show forth Christ in
the world. It pays heed to the Biblical language that describes the church as
the body of Christ. It takes seriously Paul&#8217;s description of Christians as
ambassadors for Christ and his language of &#8220;filling up what is lacking in the
sufferings of Christ&#8221; (Colossians 1:24). And, at its best, the language has been
used to channel all of this into a synthesis of evangelistic and social action
that truly represent the best of what evangelicalism can&nbsp;be.</p>
<p>Yet for all that, I think the language is a mistake, and a serious one. There
are better ways to express these concepts, and expressing them in this way makes
us miss other important concepts which we might find if we thought more about
<em>real</em> incarnational&nbsp;theology.</p>
<p>It is not that this way of speaking is wholly wrong. As I noted, there are many
ways in which talk of our working &#8220;incarnationally&#8221; is moving in the right
direction. Unfortunately, though, such language tends to blind us to the
uniqueness of the Incarnation of Christ. God becoming man was an astounding
event, a greater thing than all our philosophers had dreamed. Not for nothing
did Lewis write that &#8220;It was the central event in the history of the Earth—the
very thing that the whole story has been about&#8221; (<em>Miracles</em>). When we speak of
ourselves &#8220;incarnating&#8221; Christ, we begin to blur out the sheer shock of the
event. In the same vein, this sort of language too readily tempts us turn our
eyes away from the one we supposedly incarnate and to look instead to ourselves.
For Christ, becoming Incarnate was the ultimate act of humility. Can we say the
same of our &#8220;incarnating&#8221;&nbsp;him?</p>
<p>Moreover, the language hides what the metaphors used of Christians in the New
Testament make explicit. Yes, we are the body of Christ&#8212;but Christ himself is
the head, and the head does not need a representative. Nor is this the only
metaphor that the apostles used of us, and the others are equally important
informative. The church is corporately and her members are each individually a
temple of God&#8212;not incarnations of Christ, but indwelt by him through his
Spirit. We are his ambassadors, servants working in his absence. When Jesus
came, God was <em>here</em> with us, but now we stand in the time between the times,
waiting for him because he is <em>not</em>. (Yes, the Spirit indwells us, and yes, God
is everywhere. But the picture we have in the consummation of all things is God
with us in a deeper way&#8212;and we do not have that&nbsp;yet.)</p>
<p>So we would do well to set aside the idea that we incarnate Christ for these
kidns of negative reasons. Better to use the language of Scripture itself and
say that we are his body, his servants, his temple, his ambassadors and
representatives. We do not incarnate him, because we cannot&#8212;the Incarnation
was unique&#8212;but that does not negate the instincts of which the theology of the
last few years has been an expression. It simply means that we need to do better
in expressing those&nbsp;ideas.</p>
<p>It seems to me, though, that even more significant than these matters of words
and meanings&#8212;important though they are&#8212;is how much we miss when our
incarnational theology is about us instead of about Jesus, the son of Mary and
the son of&nbsp;God.</p>
<h2 id="on-the-incarnation">On the&nbsp;Incarnation</h2>
<p>In the time I have been studying at Southeastern Seminary, I have come to tears
in a class only once&#8212;a few weeks ago, listening to <a href="http://www.stevemckinion.com">my theology
professor</a> exult in what Christ did for us <em>in the Incarnation</em>. In
evangelical churches, we often discuss Jesus&#8217; death on the cross, and sometimes
his perfect life or his resurrection.<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Rarely, however, do we speak of the
Incarnation. It gets a mention at Christmas&#8212;usually when we talk about how the
Virgin Birth was necessary for the fulfillment of prophecy, one of many
confirmations that Jesus was indeed the foretold&nbsp;Messiah.</p>
<p>But the Incarnation means more than this. It always has. That God became a man
is bigger than paying for our sins&#8212;marvelous though that alone would be. The
language is there throughout the whole New Testament. A few samples will do, but
I could cite many&nbsp;more.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code> And you, child, will be called the prophet of the Most High;
     for you will go before the Lord to prepare his ways,
to give knowledge of salvation to his people
    in the forgiveness of their sins,
because of the tender mercy of our God,
    whereby the sunrise shall visit us from on high
to give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death,
    to guide our feet into the way of peace.”
</code></pre>
<p>—Luke&nbsp;1:76–79</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Zechariah&#8217;s prophecy includes salvation from sin, yes, but it points to something more, too: an end to the power of death and the coming of peace. How does Christ&#8217;s work accomplish&nbsp;those?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to
become children of God, who were born, not of blood nor of the will of the
flesh nor of the will of man, but of&nbsp;God.</p>
<p>And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory,
glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth. (John bore
witness about him, and cried out, &#8220;This was he of whom I said, &#8216;He who comes
after me ranks before me, because he was before me.&#8217;&#8221;) For from his fullness
we have all received, grace upon grace. For the law was given through Moses;
grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. No one has ever seen God; the only
God, who is at the Father&#8217;s side, he has made him&nbsp;known.</p>
<p>&#8212;John&nbsp;1:11&#8211;18</p>
</blockquote>
<p>John&#8217;s description of the Incarnation points to adoption, to our being children
and heirs of God again. This was the state from which Adam and Eve fell; John
couples the Incarnation of Christ&#8212;not his death or resurrection, but his
becoming flesh&#8212;to our becoming children of God once&nbsp;again.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For in him the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily, and you have been filled
in him, who is the head of all rule and&nbsp;authority.</p>
<p>&#8212;Colossians&nbsp;2:9&#8211;10</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Paul goes on in Colossians to talk of the penal substitutionary aspect of
Christ&#8217;s work in <em>very</em> definite terms in the verses after this&#8212;but he starts
here by showing how we are filled in him even as the &#8220;whole fullness&#8221; (what a
phrase!) of deity dwells in&nbsp;him.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since therefore the children share in flesh and blood, he himself likewise
partook of the same things, that through death he might destroy the one who
has the power of death, that is, the devil, and deliver all those who through
fear of death were subject to lifelong slavery. For surely it is not angels
that he helps, but he helps the offspring of Abraham. Therefore he had to be
made like his brothers in every respect, so that he might become a merciful
and faithful high priest in the service of God, to make propitiation for the
sins of the people. For because he himself has suffered when tempted, he is
able to help those who are being&nbsp;tempted.</p>
<p>&#8212;Hebrews&nbsp;2:14&#8211;18</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hebrews shows us Jesus as propitiation for our sins&#8212;hallelujah!&#8212;and it
<em>also</em> shows us his help for us because he has suffered under temptation just as
we have. More: his death delivers us not only from the penalty from sin, but
also from death (not to mention destroying the&nbsp;devil).</p>
<p>We could go on, and on, and on. The incarnation matters, and it matters as more
than a means of getting Jesus to the cross so that he could die for our sins
(and then be raised again to prove he had done it). We reduce everything to
penal substitutionary atonement. The atonement is incredible. It is amazing. It
is one of the central affirmations and joys of the Christian faith: our sins are
paid for! Glory to God! But Jesus did <em>more</em> than that, and he is worthy of
<em>more</em> praise. He did not stop at paying the price for our sins and leaving our
bodies subject to corruption. He did not content himself with performing a
judicial act while leaving our wills broken and certain to turn again to the
same follies that led to our death and debt in the first place. Redemption is
not less than substitutionary atonement, to be sure&#8212;but it is much, much&nbsp;more.</p>
<p>Redemption is the forgiveness of sins. Redemption is the cleansing from
unrighteousness&#8212;not only from its guilt, but from its corrupting stain on our
souls. Redemption is our wills being unchained from the power of sin. Redemption
is partaking in the divine nature. Redemption is resurrection from the dead&#8212;
not a rescuscitation from which we will only die again, but to immortality.
Redemption is the mending of our communion one with another. Redemption is the
restoration of fellowship with God. Jesus took up our flesh that he might unite
humanity once again with the Triune Godhead. As we were in the beginning, so
shall we be again&#8212;but&nbsp;better.</p>
<p>Redemption began with and was accomplished through the Incarnation no less than
in Jesus&#8217; life (which is part and parcel of it) or his death (which was both
impossible and meaningless without it) or his resurrection (which completes&nbsp;it).</p>
<p>Saint Athanasius said it best long&nbsp;ago:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For being Word of the Father, and above all, He alone of natural fitness was
both able to recreate everything, and worthy to suffer on behalf of all and to
be ambassador for all with the&nbsp;Father&#8230;.</p>
<p>He took pity on our race, and had mercy on our infirmity, and condescended to
our corruption, and, unable to bear that death should have the mastery&#8212; lest
the creature should perish, and His Father&#8217;s handiwork in men be spent for
naught&#8212; He takes unto Himself a body, and that of no different sort from&nbsp;ours&#8230;.</p>
<p>And thus taking from our bodies one of like nature, because all were under
penalty of the corruption of death He gave it over to death in the stead of
all, and offered it to the Father— doing this, moreover, of His loving-
kindness, to the end that, firstly, all being held to have died in Him, the
law involving the ruin of men might be undone (inasmuch as its power was fully
spent in the Lord&#8217;s body, and had no longer holding-ground against men, his
peers), and that, secondly, whereas men had turned toward corruption, He might
turn them again toward incorruption, and quicken them from death by the
appropriation of His body and by the grace of the Resurrection, banishing
death from them like straw from the&nbsp;fire.</p>
<p>&#8212;Saint Athanasius, <em>On the&nbsp;Incarnation</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have been transformed from guilt to innocence, from folly to wisdom, from
wickedness to righteousness, from common to holy, from slaves to free, from
debtors to heirs, from death to life. And without the Incarnation, we have
<em>none</em> of that. Did Christ not take up and unite with his divinity every corner
of what it is to be human, we remain guilty, foolish, wicked, common, enslaved,
indebted, dead. With it, we have everything&#8212;God with us forever. Christ&#8217;s work
advanced through his sinless life, culminated in his death, and climaxed in his
resurrection&#8212;but it began in the&nbsp;Incarnation.</p>
<p>Thanks be to&nbsp;God.</p>
<hr />
<p>If you have not read Athanasius&#8217; <em>On the Incarnation</em>, you should. It is one of
the most important books in the history of the church, and therefore in the
history of the world. It is also short. Do yourself the great favor of <a href="http://www.christianbook.com/incarnation-greek-original-and-english-translation/saint-athanasius/9780881414097/pd/414097">getting
a copy</a> and reading it well. For my part, I have made a commitment to read
it on March 25&#8212;the day on which the church has traditionally celebrated the
Annunciation of Christ to Mary&#8212;every year for the rest of my life. I think it
is that&nbsp;important.</p>
