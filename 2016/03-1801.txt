I just put my finger on one of the (many) reasons Rust reads better than C++: the visual consistency of its function definitions. Compare---

Rust has:

- `fn foo() -> i32 {…}`
- `fn bar() -> f32 {…}`

C++ has:

- `int foo() {…}`
- `double bar() {…}`

That consistency adds up over many lines of code. There are many other such choices; the net effect is that Rust is *much* more pleasant to read than C++.
