Title: Rust and Swift
Subtitle: >
  Comparing two exciting, new, apparently (but not always <em>actually</em>) similar programming languages.
Summary: >
  Rust and Swift are in a similar phase in their development, and they look pretty similar in a lot of ways. But how similar are they actually? Where does each excel relative to the other, and what do they do differently?

Background
----------

In summer 2015, I started learning [Rust]. Then, in September 2015, I started learning [Swift]. The superficial similarities between the two languages are obvious, and they hit their stride at roughly the same time: Rust's 1.0 release was in May 2015 and Swift's 2.0 release[^swift-1] was in June 2015. Both cite inspiration from languages like Haskell, while retaining a C-like[^c-like] syntax which is more approachable to many of the developers inclined to pick up the language.

[Swift]: https://swift.org

So, when I started reading the [Swift book], comparisons were inevitable. For all that the two are very similar at a superficial level, they also make some very different choices in terms of language design and philosophy---and those choices are interesting!

Some Notes on the Series
------------------------

I am not by any means a programming language theory nut. (Or, at least, I *wasn't*. This project, alongside a few other things, might be making one of me.) I am also not an expert. My opinions are considered, but not necessarily deeply *informed*, and you'll see places where I have added corrections along the way as I got new information from feedback received along the way.

I also freely admit to a bit of a bias toward Rust, between the two. I *like* Swift, but I *really like* Rust. I think I come by this fairly, in that it's just a matter of my own language-design preferences. I like Python better than Ruby, and in terms of how the languages *feel*, Rust is more like Python and Swift more like Ruby.

But---full disclosure---I've also made something of a personal investment in the future of Rust, in that I run [a podcast][NR] focused on the language, from which I actually [earn] (a very small amount of) money.

One other thing: as of February 2016, I haven't had a chance to build anything serious in *either* language---though I hope to change that over the course of this year. So these are very much surface-level impressions of the two languages. My thoughts and feelings about the two may change over time.

One last bit: the series [literally started][1] as a series of comments in a Slack team I participate in. You'll note a substantial shift in the tone, structure, and content as I went along. The first post was really just off-the-cuff responses as I started reading. Starting with the second post, I was a good deal more intentional about what I was doing. As the series goes along, there is more and more of this, and it's also informed by my work on [New Rustacean][NR].



[^swift-1]: which functioned somewhat like its 1.0, since its actual 1.0 was the point it was announced and served as a public beta

[^c-like]: really, ALGOL-like, of course ðŸ˜‰
