&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What she describes is abhorrent and against everything Uber stands for and believes in. (Uber &lt;abbr&gt;CEO&lt;/abbr&gt; Travis Kalanick’s statement quoted at &lt;a href="http://www.recode.net/2017/2/19/14665076/ubers-travis-kalanick-susan-fowler-sexual-harassment-investigation"&gt;Recode&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article doesn’t describe the Amazon I know or the caring Amazonians I work with every day. (Amazon &lt;abbr&gt;CEO&lt;/abbr&gt; Jeff Bezos’ statement quoted at &lt;a href="http://www.geekwire.com/2015/full-memo-jeff-bezos-responds-to-cutting-nyt-expose-says-tolerance-for-lack-of-empathy-needs-to-be-zero/"&gt;Geekwire&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with this is simple. You can say all day that these events don’t represent your culture. But they &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt;. And if you’re not aware of it, that means you have two problems: the culture problem, and the fact that you’re so out of touch with what your company is actually like that you don’t know it has that culture problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you have one other, even bigger problem. If that’s the culture of the company you’ve built, it’s &lt;em&gt;your fault&lt;/em&gt;. You can’t foist it off on your underlings: you hired them. You can’t foist it off on the bureaucracy: you built it. You can’t foist it off on wrong priorities: you set those priorities. It’s on you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has been a fascinating weekend of conversations, many of them about systems and institutions and technology—with everyone from Lyft and Uber drivers to &lt;a href="https://www.twitter.com/trevinwax"&gt;Trevin Wax&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.twitter.com/joecarter"&gt;Joe Carter&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.twitter.com/mattleeanderson"&gt;Matthew Lee Anderson&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conversations &lt;a href="https://www.twitter.com/scarradini"&gt;Stephen Carradini&lt;/a&gt; and I have been having on &lt;a href="https://www.twitter.com/winningslowly"&gt;Winning Slowly&lt;/a&gt; over the last couple seasons, and &lt;a href="http://www.winningslowly.org/season-5.html"&gt;this season ahead&lt;/a&gt;, all seem more important to me than ever before. Not because the show itself is very important—it isn’t—but because these issues, and one question in particular, seem increasingly urgent in our day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That question is simple: Can we say &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; to given technologies or opportunities, not only as individuals but as communities?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we cannot, we are slaves to whatever idea someone dreams up next, whether it is good or bad, beautiful or wicked. Our tools will own us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we can, then at least some things I believe we ought. The question then will be: what technologies not only can we but &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; we refuse?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answers to those questions are more than a tweetstorm can disentangle, indeed will require years of hard work and thought to search out. But as of right now, too few are even asking them—we think instead, “We can, and we may do some good, and so we must!”—heedless of the cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These questions press especially on those of us in technology, those of us who teach, and those of us in positions of influence. The things we choose—including, sometimes most importantly, silence and refusal—will shape not only our own but also many others’ lives.&lt;/p&gt;
