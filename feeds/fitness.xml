&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2016/2016-review-intro.html"&gt;Introduction, or: a ridiculous year summarized&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2016/2016-review-1.html"&gt;Part 1: Running headfirst into a wall of pneumonia.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my goals for 2016 was to continue writing not only on this blog but in other outlets. I did a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of writing this year, but relatively little of it is published. But here’s a look at some of the numbers! Note that “This site” excludes republication of school papers, and that I don’t have an exact count for the school papers because I’ve already discarded a few of the shorter pieces, but their average length is well-known to me. More on the unpublished &lt;em&gt;Rust vs. Swift&lt;/em&gt; project below.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr class="header"&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: center;"&gt;Category&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: center;"&gt;Words&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class="odd"&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/m-div/"&gt;School&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;~130,500&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class="even"&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://mereorthodoxy.com/author/chris-krycho/"&gt;Mere Orthodoxy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;~6000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class="odd"&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;This site&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;~63,000&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class="even"&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rust vs. Swift&lt;/em&gt; project&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;~9350&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class="odd"&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;~207,850&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the writing for school, only a small fraction of it is &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/m-div/"&gt;published here&lt;/a&gt;, unlike previous years. Roughly 75,000 words of that content is research notes I put together for an independent study I did—which was deeply profitable for me in terms of thinking through hermeneutical and theological systems, and which will hopefully be helpful for the professor for whom I prepared them, but which are not at all publishable. Another 10,000 of those words fit in a category charitably describable as “busy-work” and publishing them is &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt; but would have no &lt;em&gt;value&lt;/em&gt;. The school-writing also includes the notes and manuscripts for my sermon-delivery class. You can find those sermons &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/sermons/"&gt;on this site&lt;/a&gt; as well well, with audio, video, and the manuscripts available—but the notes are not worth publishing, as they’re entirely internal. Still: they’re words, I wrote them, and there are a lot of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the plus side, I wrote one of the papers I’m proudest of from my entire seminary career in the spring: &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2016/realism-and-antirealism.html"&gt;Realism and Antirealism—A key debate in the philosophy of science (with interesting implications for young-earth creationism)&lt;/a&gt;. I’m happy with it not least because I wrote it in a very compressed fashion because of some family health issues that hit at the end of that semester, and it still turned out extremely well because I had &lt;em&gt;planned&lt;/em&gt; it meticulously. Despite having only a single draft with one typo-level revision pass, it’s easily the best paper I’ve ever written. It turns out that doing a really careful outline helps when you’re working at this scale. I’ve not normally been a fan of outlining (and I’ve not normally found it helpful when I’ve tried it), but for any longer, more sustained argument, it’s absolutely necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the content on this site (excluding republication of school papers), an astounding ~14,000 of those words are in my “microblog” content. It’s amazing how much those little posts add up. That said, I’m surprised to see that I’ve put out as many &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; words as I have this year on this site, and the total there is rather staggering. Writing on this site includes everything from &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2016/ask.html" title="Ask: a short story"&gt;fiction&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2016/to-paint-god-as-a-man.html" title="To paint God as a man: an Advent poem"&gt;poetry&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2016/a-simple-childrens-catechism.html"&gt;a simple children’s catechism&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2016/what-is-functional-programming.html"&gt;an introduction to functional programming&lt;/a&gt;. I’m exceptionally pleased in retrospect to see how this came out, and I look forward to writing on equally varied terms in the year ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some 13,000 of the words I wrote for this site were in my &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/rust-and-swift.html"&gt;Rust and Swift&lt;/a&gt; series, a project I’ve enjoyed enormously since starting it in 2015 and would like to get back to in 2017. It went on hold because I was offered, and accepted, a contract to write a 30–40 page report for O’Reilly comparing the two languages, which was intended to come out this fall. Unfortunately, somewhere along the way some wires got crossed and my pitch and what they wanted didn’t end up being the same. Once that became clear (at the beginning of October), they opted to drop the project. This was a huge disappointment to me: it was a small hit financially, but a big one time-wise, as I sunk a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of hours into it in what was an already-very-busy fall; the project was over ¾ done when it was dropped.&lt;a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few big lessons I learned from this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t overcommit. Even if the project had gone through without issue, it would have been more on my plate than I could reasonably handle. The fact that it was canceled after having done a lot of the work meant it was also &lt;em&gt;financially&lt;/em&gt; frustrating, but I had overcommitted regardless. Won’t do that again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be &lt;em&gt;even more&lt;/em&gt; clear up-front about the terms and goals of a project. I don’t know how we ended up with the crossed wires we did, but it was extremely frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you can get an advance, get an advance. Just saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;section class="footnotes"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note as well that this excludes all the &lt;a href="https://github.com/chriskrycho/newrustacean.com/tree/589cd13225cde91f92bfca93f6679f2395d78886/docs"&gt;podcast scripts&lt;/a&gt; I wrote this year! Those would add well over 10,000 more words to this count.&lt;a href="#fnref1"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, that number includes these posts!&lt;a href="#fnref2"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn3"&gt;&lt;p&gt;They wanted an analysis of when you’d choose each language; I pitched a comparison along similar lines to my blog series, looking at the language design choices as a view into software engineering tradeoffs. When the mismatch became clear, I pointed out that “when to choose Rust vs. Swift” is, generally speaking, a roughly two-sentence answer: “Choose Rust for cross-platform, high-performance/low-level code. Choose Swift if you’re writing apps on an Apple platform.” This was not, apparently, obvious to everyone else involved. In the words of the internet: &lt;span style="whitespace: nowrap"&gt;¯\_(ツ)_/¯&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#fnref3"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2016/2016-review-intro.html"&gt;Introduction, or: a ridiculous year summarized&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2016/2016-review-1.html"&gt;Part 1: Running headfirst into a wall of pneumonia.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2016/2016-review-2.html"&gt;Part 2: So. many. words. I had no idea how many words.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Part 5: Getting things done in 2016 and beyond.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Part 6: Plans for 2017!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wait, hold on,&lt;/em&gt; you say. &lt;em&gt;Go back. How did you get walking pneumonia?&lt;/em&gt; This is a fun story, and it’s a huge part of what made the other parts of the latter half of 2016 go the way they did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went for what I expected to be a 15–16 mile long run as part of training for the half-marathon I signed up for this year. The previous week &lt;a href="http://runwith.chriskrycho.com/runs/12/" title="Run summary on runwith.chriskrycho.com"&gt;I’d done a 14-mile run&lt;/a&gt;, so 15–16 would have been no problem. I was feeling &lt;em&gt;awesome&lt;/em&gt; on the run, so decided to extend it to 17. This was right at the edge of what makes good sense for a week-over-week increase in mileage; you generally want to stick with ~10% increases and max out at 20%; but 17 is right at that limit relative to 14. So I turned right to cut through another nearby town instead of left to head directly home when I was at roughly the 11-mile mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, where I &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; cut back toward home, I took a wrong turn out of a five-way intersection. (You can see on the north end of the map, in Youngsville, &lt;a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/644619792" title="Run overview on Strava"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). I realized this half a mile on, but figured there would be a spot to cut over. There is not. So I got back to where I had taken the wrong turn, filled up my water bottle and hit the bathroom, and made my way home. But at this point, I was already at ~15 miles, and ~4 miles from home. As I got back into our town, I decided: why not just go ahead and extend out to 20 miles?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the truth is, that extra three quarters of a mile probably didn’t matter a bit. 19.25 vs. 20 miles? Same difference in its effect on my immune system, which is to say: it completely crashed it. A 42% week over week increase in mileage is no joke. The little cold I picked up from my 2-year-old daughter turned into borderline bronchitis. Yay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What with a busy spring preceding—I had no idea how much busier I would be taking 2 classes and working 30 hours a week than I had been taking 3 classes and working 20 hours a week—I didn’t manage a triathlon. I had contented myself with the thought that I’d likely set another PR in my half marathon, but after weeks of recovery from walking pneumonia, that thought fell apart as well. I lost about a minute per mile in my pace, and my mileage was shot as well. I never got it back—not least because of a writing project which went south on me. I ended up being sick off and on all fall, and I’m only now getting my feet back under me. Sad to say, one of those times I got sick was the week of the half marathon I signed up for, and I’d been getting loud, clear signals from my body on previous runs that I was pushing too hard. So no race &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt; this year. But better that than pushing and injuring myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The year also saw a so-far unreversed weight gain that I find incredibly frustrating. In the first six months of 2016, I gained about ten pounds—despite keeping up the same basic activity level. I attribute this to a combination of factors: metabolic shifts in my late 20s, shifting back to doing almost purely running rather than a mix of running, swimming, and cycling, and the impact of acclimation to a workout load. I’m far from overweight, but I’m also slower and generally a bit flabbier as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s hoping 2017 is &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; better in all these regards! I plan to do a sprint-length triathlon and a full marathon. And I hope to lose those ten pounds again and get back to that healthier overall weight. That combo seems like the thing to do the year I turn thirty and graduate seminary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2016/2016-review-intro.html"&gt;Introduction, or: a ridiculous year summarized&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2016/2016-review-1.html"&gt;Part 1: Running headfirst into a wall of pneumonia.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Part 6: Plans for 2017!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2016 was a long, difficult, strange, sometimes wonderful and sometimes dreadful year for me. It was one of the most professionally and scholastically enjoyable and rewarding years of my life, and also one of the most exhausting. As I often do at years-end, I am taking stock publicly of what went well, what went poorly, and what I might do different in a variety of categories—here, mostly in terms of my public-facing endeavors. This year’s summing-up post will also (for, I think, the first time) include some numbers! But first, a few comments on the big picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of 2015, I &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2015/thoughts-on-2015-and-2016.html"&gt;offered a similar set of reflections&lt;/a&gt;. At the end of it, I laid out some plans for 2016:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am going to set a single goal in each of five major categories in my life:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;spiritual:&lt;/strong&gt; everything in my walk with God, including my own personal devotions, my involvement in the life of the church, and my “ministry” actions in general&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;family:&lt;/strong&gt; both quantity and quality time spent with my wife and my quickly-growing-up little girls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;personal:&lt;/strong&gt; podcasting, blogging, and writing for &lt;a href="http://mereorthodoxy.com/author/chris-krycho/"&gt;other outlets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;professional:&lt;/strong&gt; working in my new job and as a consultant, and carrying on toward the conclusion of my M. Div.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;health/fitness:&lt;/strong&gt; continuing to stay healthy, including eating well and continuing to stay fit by running and doing triathlon work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early in the year, I made the habit of writing these out formally on a day-by-day basis—and I did this off and on. If you were to look at my little (Moleskine-branded and delightful-to-me) daily planner, you’d see streaks of weeks where I noted specific tasks and whether I hit them or not, punctuated by weeks and months where I did nothing of the sort. I have always found it difficult to stick with these kinds of things, in part because I usually have a pretty good idea what I need to do on any given day without writing it down somewhere. (I use &lt;a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/" title="OmniFocus"&gt;other tools&lt;/a&gt; for tracking mid- and long-term deadlines for school.) In July, I started mashing this idea up with &lt;a href="http://bulletjournal.com" title="Bullet Journal site"&gt;bullet journaling&lt;/a&gt;, and I found that I (a) really like the system and (b) also didn’t stick with it consistently. A lot of that came down to the fact that I got thrown off—horribly—by getting a mild-but-still-utterly-debilitating case of walking pneumonia in July. (On which, more in a moment.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So much for last year’s ideas about &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; I was going to hit those goals. How did I actually do at addressing them? The answer is: &lt;em&gt;okay&lt;/em&gt;. 2016 was not an amazing year. It was not a terrible year. But it had as many downs as ups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My own walk with God remains &lt;em&gt;steady&lt;/em&gt;. Nothing amazing to report here, but I’m more than okay with that. I will perhaps say more on this in another post, but the older I get the more convinced I am that emotional highs are a trap. Sentiment and true religion are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the same thing; and Scripture calls us to &lt;em&gt;faithfulness&lt;/em&gt;, not &lt;em&gt;spiritual feelings&lt;/em&gt;. As such, in a year with this many bumps, I am glad to say that I had no horrible falls, and I read my Bible nearly every day and prayed every single day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our family learned some Bible verses, and started working on the Heidelberg Catechism. We shared the gospel with people as we were able, and met faithfully with our church. We were not extraordinary, and we were far from flawless, but I think we did &lt;em&gt;well&lt;/em&gt;. I hope and pray in God’s grace we are able to continue in faithfully doing well in the years to come. Certainly if there is one thing I hope to do more of in 2017 it is spend time with my girls. I am not a huge “kid person,” but these years are precious and go by quickly; far better to spend more time with them and have a podcast episode or a writing project go out later (or not at all) than to miss these little years.&lt;/p&gt;

</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chris Krycho</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 17 Jul 2016 16:34:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:www.chriskrycho.com,2016-07-17:2016/07-17-1634.html</guid><category>fitness</category></item><item><title>Run With Me!</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2016/run-with-me.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I may have gone mad with power or something, but I launched another podcast today! Crazy, I know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s both more and less crazy than it might sound, though. More, because of what the podcast is, and less, because of what the podcast is. So what is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="//runwith.chriskrycho.com"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Run With Me&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a microcast, with 3–5-minute long episodes &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; running, recorded &lt;em&gt;while&lt;/em&gt; running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="//cdn.chriskrycho.com/runwith/cover-web.jpg" title="_Run With Me_ cover art" alt="Run With Me" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Run With Me&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I allow myself an absolute maximum of ten minutes to edit and publish the episodes. (So far, I’ve never needed more than about &lt;em&gt;three&lt;/em&gt; minutes.) So, for anyone worried that I’m unnecessarily or unwisely adding something more to my already-full plate: don’t be. Apart from spending some of my relaxation time this weekend building the site, the only time I’ll spend on this will be time I would already be spending running or cooling down after a run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far (two episodes in!) it’s a ton of fun. I’ve enjoyed the process of recording it, and it’s nice to be able to talk about running confident that whoever listens is actually interested. (As I explain further on the show, that interest in not boring my audience is part of why I’m doing this, rather than just talking to people I know.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any interest in running, and especially if you like listening to podcasts while you run, I think you’ll enjoy this. I’d love it if you subscribed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/run-with-me/id1102273878?mt=2"&gt;&lt;i class="fa fa-fw fa-music"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; iTunes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://overcast.fm/p418939-N58r18"&gt;&lt;i class="fa fa-fw fa-play-circle"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Overcast&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://pca.st/5toh"&gt;&lt;i class="fa fa-fw fa-play-circle-o"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; PocketCasts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://runwith.chriskrycho.com/feed.xml"&gt;&lt;i class="fa fa-fw fa-rss"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Old-fashioned RSS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few comments on the podcast from a form/genre angle, and a few from a technical angel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can think of &lt;a href="//www.manton.org/2016/01/new-podcast-timetable.html"&gt;“microcasts”&lt;/a&gt; as being not terribly dissimilar from a &lt;a href="//www.chriskrycho.com/micro/"&gt;microblog post&lt;/a&gt; in its own way. I’m happily stealing the idea of a microcast from &lt;a href="//www.manton.org"&gt;Manton Reece&lt;/a&gt;, whose &lt;a href="//timetable.manton.org"&gt;Timetable&lt;/a&gt; show is a delightful little thing. (It’s not original to him; a quick [Google search] will turn up instances of the term dating back several years at least, but he’s where I got the idea, and I think he’s certainly one of the first to be popularizing the form.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find podcasting as a medium extremely interesting in general (I’m &lt;a href="//www.winningslowly.org"&gt;sure&lt;/a&gt; you would &lt;a href="//www.newrustacean.com"&gt;never&lt;/a&gt; have &lt;a href="//www.sap-py.com"&gt;guessed&lt;/a&gt; that), and I think microcasts will proliferate rapidly. As my friend &lt;a href="http://oluseyi.info"&gt;Oluseyi Sonaiya&lt;/a&gt; and I have often discussed, brevity is a real virtue in podcasting, and one too-little appreciated by many amateur producers in the space. &lt;a href="http://independentclauses.com"&gt;Stephen&lt;/a&gt; and I aim for that balance with &lt;a href="//www.winningslowly.org"&gt;Winning Slowly&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s always been a part of my consideration with &lt;a href="//www.newrustacean.com"&gt;New Rustacean&lt;/a&gt; as well. People’s time is valuable. Saying something and then &lt;em&gt;being done&lt;/em&gt; is a kindness to your audience.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, practically speaking, there’s the simple reality that it’s just &lt;em&gt;harder&lt;/em&gt; to record a long-form podcast while running. Especially a good one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a tech level, producing the podcast is incredibly simple: I use the built-in microphone in the headphones that come with an iPhone to record, and do the recording and (extremely minimal) audio production in &lt;a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/ferrite-recording-studio/id1018780185?mt=8&amp;amp;at=1001l4KM"&gt;Ferrite&lt;/a&gt;. When I say minimal, I mean really minimal: I chop off the bits before I start talking, and the bits after I start talking, and I do all of that on my iPhone. Then I export to Dropbox, and from there to my CDN. That’s it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="refs" class="references"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chris Krycho</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 20 Feb 2016 15:50:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:www.chriskrycho.com,2016-02-20:2016/2016-02-20-1550.html</guid><category>fitness</category></item><item><title>How I Became a (Relatively) Quick Runner</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2015/how-i-became-a-relatively-quick-runner.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, I ran the &lt;a href="http://cityofoaksmarathon.com"&gt;City of Oaks&lt;/a&gt; half marathon event for the third consecutive year. I finished at 1:24:58, which comes out to be about a 6:29/mile pace. I finished 20th overall, out of thousands of half-marathoners. If that seems fast to you, well, it seems fast to me, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People often ask me how I run so far and so quickly. I always laugh when they ask, because for my part, I haven’t thought of myself as particularly fast—the guys who finished first in my race this year ran over a minute per mile faster than me.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The best half-marathoners in the world are running a 4:30/mile pace! But I grant that a 6:29/mile pace is, in the grand scheme of things, pretty quick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That leads me to the &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; reason I don’t tend to think of myself as fast: my training approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My half marathon times have always been pretty good,&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; but it is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; because I am particularly athletic. As I mentioned in &lt;a href="/2015/how-i-became-a-runner.html"&gt;my first post&lt;/a&gt; in this series: you can ask my high school football coaches. I was never particularly quick, and even now my best mile time is somewhere around 5:30. I knew people even in high school who were in the mid- to low-4:00 range. Still, going sub-6:30 for 13 miles is no joke, and if you had told me even five years ago—after I started running!—that someday I would run the race I did a few weeks ago, I’d have laughed in disbelief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it really is all in the training. I have two things going for me, and only two: I train &lt;em&gt;smart&lt;/em&gt;, and I train &lt;em&gt;consistently&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consistency first: year-round, I am doing some sort of workout six days a week. Throughout the winter and spring, that will look like a mix of running, spin classes at the gym, and swimming as I prep for another triathlon. From now till the end of January or so, I’ll just do pretty much whatever I feel like in that mix, while keeping at it. From February till whatever point early next summer that my triathlon is, I’ll dedicate two workouts a week to each of the sports. Then I’ll slowly transition to nearly-all running. Through the fall, I will run 5–6 days a week, cycling for a commute when weather permits one of those days instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That right there is the single biggest factor in my performance. If &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; did 30–45 minutes a day four days a week, an hour one day a week, and ninety minutes to two hours another day a week, he would get quicker rapidly. If he did that for five and a half years (as I have been), he would likely be in very similar shape to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for training smart, I basically just follow the &lt;a href="http://philmaffetone.com/what-is-the-maffetone-method/"&gt;Maffetone method&lt;/a&gt;. Most of my runs are easy, aerobic runs. Even at the height of my training for a half marathon, when I am running 45–50 miles each week, 80% of my miles are at a conversational pace. (I’ve carried on fifteen-minute-long phone conversations on runs before!) My long runs include a hard, roughly race-pace finish for the last three or four miles, and I do one hard run a week which is half aerobic and half pushing harder than race speed.&lt;a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; But overall, I run a slow-for-me pace most of the time. I use a heart-rate monitor to help me stay in an easy, aerobic training zone, and I simply don’t go over that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That slow-run training pays off in a couple ways. First, it builds up my body’s ability to process energy aerobically (see &lt;a href="http://philmaffetone.com/what-is-the-maffetone-method/"&gt;the Maffetone method article&lt;/a&gt; for details). Second, it’s much easier on my body—I simply don’t have the joint problems or soreness that many runners do. Third, it is &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; easier mentally, because I can enjoy my runs and not feel exhausted after them. That means it’s much easier to do them day after day, and that takes me back to the consistency point from above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you want to run fast: run a lot, and usually run slow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The top finisher came in at 1:10:03 (to my 1:24:48)—a 5:21/mile pace. The record on the course—which isn’t a perfect match for what we ran today, but pretty similar—is 1:04:21, which is about a 4:55 pace. That’s &lt;em&gt;blisteringly&lt;/em&gt; fast.&lt;a href="#fnref1"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my first, in December 2011, I ran a 1:36:32, which is about a 7:23 pace.&lt;a href="#fnref2"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn3"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also occasionally through speed work days; this fall I did one day of hill repeats: a quarter mile pushing &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt; up a hill, a quarter mile easy back down the hill, and a minute of rest. Five miles of that is tough; I’d like to do more in future years.&lt;a href="#fnref3"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

In three weeks, I’ll run my seventh half marathon,&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and I finished my first triathlon last summer. So, yes, I do run a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s still a little strange to me. I came to running late, and in a roundabout way. Many of my friends ran cross country in high school; I played football (and poorly at that) instead. I ran off and on in college in a (mostly failing) attempt to stay in shape and avoid college weight. The only running I did consistently was playing Ultimate on Fridays with some friends. For the first year I was out of college, my routine was much the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then I got mono. I drank after a friend who carries around a particularly virulent strain of it, and was down for the count: a month in bed, and two months of recovery after that. I was, in theory, the captain of a church league Ultimate team that spring. I missed half the games, and even when I was able to attend some of them in the latter half of the season, it left me literally needing a nap just to stand and watch for an hour. In the hopes of being back in good enough shape to play the following fall, I started running as soon as I was cleared by the doctor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That first run on a treadmill in May 2010 was painfully slow. Even when I was furthest out of shape before that, running an 8-minute mile had been doable—painful, perhaps, but doable. That day I ran a 12-minute mile, and was done for the day. The same thing another day that week. And again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But slowly, over time, I built up my endurance. I managed to run two miles outside a few weeks later. By the time Ultimate season rolled around in late August, I could run five miles, and was doing three to five miles four times a week. I was in good enough shape to play Ultimate, and I enjoyed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, I found running hard, and didn’t particularly enjoy it. I ran solely as a means to the end of playing Ultimate. More, five miles was my upper limit if I ran hard (as I always did). When I thought about people who ran half-marathons—still less the full—I simply could not understand how they did it. But I started to &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then I had one simple conversation, which changed my entire approach to running. It set me on a course to this seventh half-marathon, and to being “that runner guy” around here. It led to my being the healthiest I’ve ever been. And, strangest of all, it ended up with my &lt;em&gt;loving&lt;/em&gt; to run—and not because I like pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But more on that next time.&lt;/p&gt;

The last few weeks of class were of course even busier than the rest of the semester, courtesy of a couple major assignments I wrapped up and studying for and taking finals, all while doing my normal work as a software developer on the side. Writing simply fell by the wayside, alas. Even my devotions posts simply didn’t happen. And that is all right; there are seasons for all of these things, and it is not as if I didn’t write many thousands of words in late April and early May. They simply were not &lt;em&gt;blogging&lt;/em&gt; words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here I am tonight, writing simply to unwind. I spent much of the day working on various software projects—a pattern I expect to carry throughout the summer. In addition to my regular work for Quest Consultants Inc. back in Norman, I am picking up various web design and development jobs over the summer. God has been gracious in answering prayers for opportunities to pick up extra contracting work, and I have several really excellent opportunities to supplement my 20 hours a week for Quest with other work. That is nice not only financially, but also intellectually. The change of pace between different kinds of work helps me stay fresh on all of them. My own personal &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/a-little-crazy.html"&gt;side projects&lt;/a&gt; are coming along slowly, but that is all right. Slow but steady is the best way to go about those kinds of projects anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That lesson is one I have learned more and more from my ongoing and ever-increasing delight in running. So far in May I have run about 125 miles; I expect to run over 150 miles this month in total (though of course all such plans are always subject to revision, and never more so than when one’s wife is 37 weeks pregnant). I am now running easy, aerobic miles ten to fifteen seconds faster per mile than I could manage in my personal best half marathon time a few years ago. I run so (relatively) quickly now not because of any particular innate athleticism—quite the contrary, as anyone who has known me since high school can attest. I can run as far and fast as I do only because I have stuck with it and used a &lt;a href="http://markallenonline.com/maoArticles.aspx?AID=2" title="Working Your Heart"&gt;smart training plan&lt;/a&gt;. And really, as in most parts of life, it is that sticking-with-it that leads to getting somewhere. Of course, sticking with it is no guarantee that things will work out. It is usually a requisite step along the way, though—a necessary-though-insufficient condition. That is simply the way God built the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little Ellie is quickly wrapping up her second year of life in this big world. She is saying lots of words (at last!), whining until she has driven Jaimie a bit crazy (in too-typical toddler fashion), and growing up in big ways and small. We are having a great deal of fun watching her start to be more socially aware and active, even if it is a little strange to have a daughter old enough that she has friends whom she loves and who love her in turn. She has also discovered a deep love of &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;—no surprise for a daughter of ours, though the intensity of her delight in the movies, for a girl who is not yet two years old, did surprise both Jaimie and me a bit. You should hear her try to say “Darth Vader” or “Dark Side” or “Star Wars.” It is impossibly adorable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jaimie is, as noted above, some 37 weeks pregnant and quite ready to be done carrying our second little gal on the inside. She is still plugging away slowly at the &lt;a href="http://jaimiekrycho.com/shaking-epheria-pt-1/" title="Bloodlines: The Shaking of Epheria, Part I"&gt;second novella&lt;/a&gt; in her &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bloodlines-Epheria-The-Trilogy-ebook/dp/B00HY478QO/" title="Get Bloodlines of Epheria on Kindle!"&gt;Bloodlines&lt;/a&gt; fantasy trilogy. She manages to keep Ellie entertained—no small feat—and does a remarkable job taking care of things around the house so that I can focus on work and school. Her struggle with &lt;a href="http://2012-2013.chriskrycho.com/theology/marriage-depression/" title="Marriage and Depression"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; has not diminished, but God has given us grace to carry on and she and I have both learned to respond in better, healthier, more helpful ways when the slumps come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the future, we really have no idea what the next several yeras will hold. I plan to finish my Master of Divinity—Lord willing, around December 2016. In the meantime, we will keep raising our little girls, I will keep writing software, and we will keep exploring and seeing what we want to do and how best to pursue those desires in a way that honors God. Who knows what those years will hold? God only, and certainly not us.&lt;/p&gt;
