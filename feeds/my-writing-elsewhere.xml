&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been common these past few years to speak of &amp;#8220;incarnational theology&amp;#8221;
as a way of describing the Christian mission to the world: we ought to
&amp;#8220;incarnate&amp;#8221; Christ to the world as Christ &amp;#8220;incarnated&amp;#8221; the Godhead to us.
There is much to appreciate in this sentiment&amp;#8230;. Yet for all that, I think
that applying the language of incarnation to believers is a serious&amp;nbsp;mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Incarnation matters, and it matters as more than a means of getting Jesus
to the cross so that he could die for our sins. We evangelicals too often
reduce everything to penal substitutionary atonement. Yes, the atonement is
incredible and amazing. It is one of the central affirmations and joys of the
Christian faith: our sins are paid for! Glory to God! But Jesus did more than
that, and he is worthy of yet more praise. He did not stop at paying the price
for our sins while leaving our bodies subject to corruption. He did not
content himself with performing a judicial act while leaving our wills broken,
certain to turn again to the same sin that led to our death in the first&amp;nbsp;place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think &lt;a href="http://mereorthodoxy.com/god-become-man-richer-theology-incarnation/"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; is the best thing I&amp;#8217;ve written so far this year; I hope you
find it&amp;nbsp;stimulating.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chris Krycho</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2014 08:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:www.chriskrycho.com,2014-03-25:2014/god-become-man-toward-a-richer-theology-of-the-incarnation.html</guid><category>links</category><category>my writing elsewhere</category></item></channel></rss>
