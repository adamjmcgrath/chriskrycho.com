find it helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week saw the premiere of Darren Aronofsky&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Noah&lt;/em&gt;, and with it a
(predictable) storm of controversy from the evangelical community. Reviews
have ranged from &lt;a href="http://www.albertmohler.com/2014/03/31/drowning-in-distortion-darren-aronofskys-noah/"&gt;predictably critical&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/churchofthemasses/2014/03/the-utter-embarrassing-mess-of-noah-and-why-everybody-is-lying-about-it/"&gt;outright disdain&lt;/a&gt;
to &lt;a href="http://drbrianmattson.com/journal/2014/3/31/sympathy-for-the-devil"&gt;hostile readings&lt;/a&gt;, and from &lt;a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2014/march-web-only/noah.html?paging=off"&gt;strongly (though not unreservedly)
positive&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://convergemagazine.com/noah-film-12561/"&gt;more restrained restrained affirmation&lt;/a&gt; of the
film on &lt;a href="http://www.relevantmagazine.com/culture/film/noah"&gt;aesthetic and spiritual&lt;/a&gt; grounds to especially measured
&lt;a href="http://www.catholicworldreport.com/Item/3036/inoahi_a_theological_reflection.aspx"&gt;theological&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://christandpopculture.com/stars-strange-review-noah/"&gt;artistic engagement&lt;/a&gt;. In short, the responses
spanned exactly the range one would expect from the evangelical community,
which is itself deeply divided on the purpose, value, and meaning of the
arts&amp;mdash;decades of conversation on the topic notwithstanding. &lt;em&gt;Noah&lt;/em&gt; works as a
sort of theological-artistic Rorschach test. We seem to find it in what we
expect given its origins and our disposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than offer another review (which would add nothing to the conversation
at this point), or decry once again the predictable evangelical response to
the arts, or even critique reviews with which I disagreed, I thought it might
be useful instead to ask where we stand today and point to a few places we
might grow from this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think you&amp;rsquo;ll find &lt;a href="http://mereorthodoxy.com/noah-theological-aesthetic-rorschach-test/"&gt;the rest of the piece&lt;/a&gt; salient and helpful.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chris Krycho</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 08 Apr 2014 19:35:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:www.chriskrycho.com,2014-04-08:2014/noah-a-theological-aesthetic-rorschach-test.html</guid><category>links</category><category>my writing elsewhere</category></item><item><title>God Become Man: Toward a Richer Theology of the Incarnation</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/god-become-man-toward-a-richer-theology-of-the-incarnation.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;My latest piece over at Mere Orthodoxy (and the first such in too long):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been common these past few years to speak of &amp;ldquo;incarnational theology&amp;rdquo;
as a way of describing the Christian mission to the world: we ought to
&amp;ldquo;incarnate&amp;rdquo; Christ to the world as Christ &amp;ldquo;incarnated&amp;rdquo; the Godhead to us.
There is much to appreciate in this sentiment.... Yet for all that, I think
that applying the language of incarnation to believers is a serious mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Incarnation matters, and it matters as more than a means of getting Jesus
to the cross so that he could die for our sins. We evangelicals too often
reduce everything to penal substitutionary atonement. Yes, the atonement is
incredible and amazing. It is one of the central affirmations and joys of the
Christian faith: our sins are paid for! Glory to God! But Jesus did more than
that, and he is worthy of yet more praise. He did not stop at paying the price
for our sins while leaving our bodies subject to corruption. He did not
content himself with performing a judicial act while leaving our wills broken,
certain to turn again to the same sin that led to our death in the first
place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think &lt;a href="http://mereorthodoxy.com/god-become-man-richer-theology-incarnation/"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; is the best thing I&amp;rsquo;ve written so far this year; I hope you
find it stimulating.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chris Krycho</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2014 08:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:www.chriskrycho.com,2014-03-25:2014/god-become-man-toward-a-richer-theology-of-the-incarnation.html</guid><category>links</category><category>my writing elsewhere</category></item></channel></rss>
