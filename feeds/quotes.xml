&lt;p&gt;No matter that Deuteronomy had envisioned it and the prophets had foretold it;
nothing could prepare one for the ruel reality and the apparently finality of
the situation. The burden of Lamentations is not to question why this
happened, but to give expression to the fact that it did. At certain moments
the book seems to look beyond the destruction, to hold out hope for the
future, but in the end despair overcomes hope. Past and future have little
place in the book. It centers on the &amp;ldquo;present&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;the moment of trauma, the
interminable suffering. The book is not an explanation of suffering but a
re-creation of it and a commemoration of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why immortalize this moment of destruction? Because in its own way it signals
the truth of the Bible&amp;rsquo;s theology, and it points to the continuation of the
covenant between God and Israel....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This explains why the poet can cry out to God and expect a response, why can
vent his anger at God, why he can declare that God continues to exist even
though his temple does not (Lam 5:18&amp;ndash;19), why God is portrayed as so strong
and the enemy gets no credit for the destruction. The suffering is, as it
were, an affirmation that God is still there and still concerned with the fate
of Israel. He may hide his face, but he has not ceased to be Israel&amp;rsquo;s God.
Lamentations contains the seeds of comfort and religious rebuilding that the
exilic prophets (especially Second Isaiah) developed more fully in the
aftermath of the destruction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; Lamentations more than anything is about formation: discovering what it
means to be human in a world where things often times seems [sic] upside down.
Lamentations squares off with this reality and responds with artistry and
humanity before God. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chris Krycho</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 18 Apr 2015 09:05:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:www.chriskrycho.com,2015-04-18:2015/artistry-and-humanity.html</guid><category>quotes</category></item><item><title>On the Incarnation</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/on-the-incarnation.html</link><description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For as when a figure painted on wood has been soiled by dirt from
outside, it is necessary for him whose figure it is to come again, so
that the image can be renewed on the same material&amp;mdash;because of his
portrait even the material on which it is painted is not cast aside,
but the portrait is reinscribed on it. In the same way the all-holy
Son of the Father, being the Image of the Father, came to our place to
renew the human being made according to himself, and to find him, as
one lost, through the forgiveness, as himself says in the Gospels, &amp;ldquo;I
came to seek and save the lost&amp;rdquo; (Lk 19.10).... So, rightly wishing to
help human beings, he sojourned as a human being, taking to himself a
body like theirs and from below&amp;mdash;I mean through the works of the
body&amp;mdash;that those not wishing to know him from his providence and
governance of the universe, from the works done through the body might
know the Word of God in the body, and through him the Father....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now then, if they ask why he did not appear through other more noble
parts of creation, or use some nobler instrument, as the sun or moon
or stars or fire or air, but merely a human being, let them know that
the Lord came not to be put on display but to heal and to teach those
who were suffering. One being put on display only needs to appear and
dazzle the beholders; but one who heals and teaches does not simply
sojourn, but is of service to those in need and appears as those who
need him can bear, lest by exceeding the need of those who suffer he
trouble the very ones in need and the manifestation of the divine be
of no benefit to them....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Properly, therefore, the Word of God took a body and used a human
instrument, in order to give life to the body and in order that, just
as he is known in creation by his works, so also he might act in a
human being, and show himself everywhere, leaving nothing barren of
his divinity and knowledge. Again, I repeat, resuming what we said
before, that the Savior did this in order that as he fills everything
everywhere by his presence, so also he might fill all things with the
knowledge of himself, as the divine scriptures say, &amp;lsquo;The whole earth
was filled with the knowledge of God&amp;rsquo; (Isa 11.9).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A faithful worship leader magnifies the greatness of God in Jesus Christ
through the power of the Holy Spirit by skillfully combining God&amp;rsquo;s Word with
music, thereby motivating the gathered church to proclaim the gospel, to
cherish God&amp;rsquo;s presence, and to live for God&amp;rsquo;s glory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doctrine is not merely an affair of the tongue, but of the life; is not
apprehended by the intellect and memory merely, like other branches of
learning; but is received only when it possesses the whole soul, and finds its
seat and habitation in the inmost recesses of the heart.... To doctrine in
which our religion is contained we have given the first place, since by it our
salvation commences; but it must be transfused into the breast, and pass into
the conduct, and so transform us into itself, as not to prove unfruitful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chris Krycho</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2014 23:02:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:www.chriskrycho.com,2014-11-04:2014/doctrine.html</guid><category>quotes</category></item><item><title>Soul History</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/soul-history.html</link><description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short story is the pastoral form for narrating &lt;em&gt;Heilsgeschichte&lt;/em&gt;
(salvation history) in the vocabulary of &lt;em&gt;Seelsgeschichte&lt;/em&gt; (soul history). In
the &lt;em&gt;Heilsgeschichte&lt;/em&gt; of Judges, for instance, the enmity of the Midianiites
is kerygmatically integrated into the historical narrative and shown to be a
part of salvation; in the &lt;em&gt;Seelsgeschichte&lt;/em&gt; of Ruth the bitter emptiness of
Naomi is pastorally attended to under the dynamics of providence and guided to
a concluding fullness. In the &lt;em&gt;Heilsgeschichte&lt;/em&gt; of Exodus the formidable and
unyielding Egyptians are judged and defeated in the catastrophic plagues and
miraculous sea crossing; in the &lt;em&gt;Seelsgeschichte&lt;/em&gt; of Ruth the everday
ordinariness of gleaning in the barley fields is used as a means for
accomplishing redemption. In the &lt;em&gt;Heilsgeschichte&lt;/em&gt; of Joshua the gigantically
walled fortress Jericho is surrounded and conquered by the total community of
God in colorful parade, accompanied by brilliantly sounding trumpets, and the
promised land is entered; in the &lt;em&gt;Seelsgeschichte&lt;/em&gt; of Ruth an old levirate law
is patiently and quietly worked through by some old men at the city gates of
provincial Bethlehem, and a link is forged in the genealogical chain of the
Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
