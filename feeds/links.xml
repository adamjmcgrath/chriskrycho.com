This was just the first time I’ve ever actually had someone reuse something I did and shared like this. It was a strange (but ultimately wonderful) feeling. I hope to have it again many more times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, I rather like the tweaks Andrew Comenga made to my design to make it his own; &lt;a href="//andrewcamenga.com/"&gt;go take a look&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

This doesn’t excuse riots, but it sure as heck &lt;em&gt;explains&lt;/em&gt; them. Baltimore is broken, but primarily in a massive system of abuse. Yes, pray for peace. But remember that civic peace comes in large part through civic &lt;em&gt;justice&lt;/em&gt;; rule of law follows the law ruling justly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connor Friedersdorf has a lot more; &lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/04/the-brutality-of-police-culture-in-baltimore/391158/"&gt;you need to read it&lt;/a&gt;, even though—or rather, precisely because—it is such a mess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I don’t want a back door,” Rogers said. “I want a front door. And I want the front door to have multiple locks. Big locks….”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rogers suggests the adoption of “front door” access will allow for essential security measures while keeping data safe from hackers or an outside attack. But opponents of the idea note that even broken into pieces, a master digital key creates security flaws. “There’s no way to do this where you don’t have unintentional vulnerabilities,” Donna Dodson, chief cyber­security adviser at the Commerce Department’s National Institute of Standards and Technologies, told the Post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That last bit is absolutely true. The government basically wants to make sure it can spy on anyone, any time it wants. That’s a bad, bad plan.&lt;/p&gt;

The review proper concludes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, Echoes of Eden says all the right things. Barrs has provided a healthy, sound theology of the arts, reiterating and synthesizing the helpful work of Schaeffer, Lewis, Tolkien, O’Connor, and Dostoevsky. What is more, his survey of English literature grounds that theology in concrete examples we can follow. This is a solid book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there was a bit more to say about this, because…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was one thing it lacked, though: beauty of its own. As Barrs himself says, “A book that is not well-written, no matter how compelling the story is, will not be reread multiple times” (114). I doubt I will read Echoes of Eden again, because this is true for non-fiction as well. Form matters. It may not be quite true that the way we say things is just as important as what we say—better to say the truth boringly than a lie splendidly—but it comes a close second. The truth is beautiful, and we should always aim to present it beautifully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think you’ll find the rest interesting! &lt;a href="http://mereorthodoxy.com/speak-truth-beauty-review-echoes-eden/"&gt;Take a look.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A note: I actually meant to have this reviewed about 18 months ago. I got buried in Greek III and it totally slipped my mind! Gladly, the folks at Crossway who sent me the book were understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

I enjoy Kindle and iPad, but I still love books best. Turns out I’m not alone… and there might just be reason for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/05/reading-on-screen-versus-paper/"&gt;Brandon Keim at Wired:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paper books were supposed to be dead by now. For years, information theorists, marketers, and early adopters have told us their demise was imminent. Ikea even redesigned a bookshelf to hold something other than books. Yet in a world of screen ubiquity, many people still prefer to do their serious reading on paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Count me among them. When I need to read deeply—when I want to lose myself in a story or an intellectual journey, when focus and comprehension are paramount—I still turn to paper. Something just feels fundamentally richer about reading on it. And researchers are starting to think there’s something to this feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week saw the premiere of Darren Aronofsky’s &lt;em&gt;Noah&lt;/em&gt;, and with it a (predictable) storm of controversy from the evangelical community. Reviews have ranged from &lt;a href="http://www.albertmohler.com/2014/03/31/drowning-in-distortion-darren-aronofskys-noah/"&gt;predictably critical&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/churchofthemasses/2014/03/the-utter-embarrassing-mess-of-noah-and-why-everybody-is-lying-about-it/"&gt;outright disdain&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://drbrianmattson.com/journal/2014/3/31/sympathy-for-the-devil"&gt;hostile readings&lt;/a&gt;, and from &lt;a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2014/march-web-only/noah.html?paging=off"&gt;strongly (though not unreservedly) positive&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://convergemagazine.com/noah-film-12561/"&gt;more restrained restrained affirmation&lt;/a&gt; of the film on &lt;a href="http://www.relevantmagazine.com/culture/film/noah"&gt;aesthetic and spiritual&lt;/a&gt; grounds to especially measured &lt;a href="http://www.catholicworldreport.com/Item/3036/inoahi_a_theological_reflection.aspx"&gt;theological&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://christandpopculture.com/stars-strange-review-noah/"&gt;artistic engagement&lt;/a&gt;. In short, the responses spanned exactly the range one would expect from the evangelical community, which is itself deeply divided on the purpose, value, and meaning of the arts—decades of conversation on the topic notwithstanding. &lt;em&gt;Noah&lt;/em&gt; works as a sort of theological-artistic Rorschach test. We seem to find it in what we expect given its origins and our disposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than offer another review (which would add nothing to the conversation at this point), or decry once again the predictable evangelical response to the arts, or even critique reviews with which I disagreed, I thought it might be useful instead to ask where we stand today and point to a few places we might grow from this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think you’ll find &lt;a href="http://mereorthodoxy.com/noah-theological-aesthetic-rorschach-test/"&gt;the rest of the piece&lt;/a&gt; salient and helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chris Krycho</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 08 Apr 2014 19:35:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:www.chriskrycho.com,2014-04-08:2014/noah-a-theological-aesthetic-rorschach-test.html</guid><category>links</category><category>my writing elsewhere</category></item><item><title>Death Before the Fall</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/death-before-the-fall.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;This bit by Alastair Reynolds is an &lt;em&gt;excellent&lt;/em&gt; summary of the position to which I have slowly come over the last few years of reflection on the question of physical death before the Fall. It shows the influence of patristic thought in the best way possible, and also demonstrates a great handle on the bigger picture of salvation history in the whole of the canon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few salient quotes. First, on moral and physical perfection:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perfection was not the creation’s natural state, but its intended destiny (and salvation is not a ‘rebooting’ of creation to its primary state, but the restoring of creation to the future that God originally intended for it)….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With perfection, our wills will be so capable of apprehending our good that we will no longer be capable of willing to do evil, not by virtue of some external compulsion, but by virtue of mature wills and natures and their appropriate mutual correspondence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then from the conclusion, which I positively &lt;em&gt;loved&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, Christ’s obedience is not about ‘innocence’ but about ‘perfection’. Christ brings humanity to the height and fullness of its divinely intended moral stature. He gives us, not merely innocence or obedience, but full maturity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, humanity was always intended to die and rise again to a more glorious form of life. Christ death and resurrection achieves this destiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, as the last Adam, Christ will pacify and tame the entire creation, ruling until every enemy is placed under his feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth, as we are in Christ, the bad character of death is minimized. We are not unclothed to be left naked, but in order to be more fully clothed, to have death swallowed up in life. We are still subject to the hostile attacks of the world and to the possibility of death within it, but Christ is the Tree of Life and we have unrestricted access to him. Death is no longer the alienating power that it once was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a great read, start to finish. &lt;a href="http://alastairadversaria.wordpress.com/2014/04/08/death-before-the-fall/"&gt;“Death Before the Fall”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been common these past few years to speak of “incarnational theology” as a way of describing the Christian mission to the world: we ought to “incarnate” Christ to the world as Christ “incarnated” the Godhead to us. There is much to appreciate in this sentiment…. Yet for all that, I think that applying the language of incarnation to believers is a serious mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Incarnation matters, and it matters as more than a means of getting Jesus to the cross so that he could die for our sins. We evangelicals too often reduce everything to penal substitutionary atonement. Yes, the atonement is incredible and amazing. It is one of the central affirmations and joys of the Christian faith: our sins are paid for! Glory to God! But Jesus did more than that, and he is worthy of yet more praise. He did not stop at paying the price for our sins while leaving our bodies subject to corruption. He did not content himself with performing a judicial act while leaving our wills broken, certain to turn again to the same sin that led to our death in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think &lt;a href="http://mereorthodoxy.com/god-become-man-richer-theology-incarnation/"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; is the best thing I’ve written so far this year; I hope you find it stimulating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you run in certain Facebook circles, you’ve likely already read that North Korean leader Kim Jung-un has called for the execution of 33 North Korean Christians. According to the widely circulated reports, these 33 people were detained after it was discovered they had ties to Kim Jung-wook, a South Korean missionary whose arrest for religious activity last year has made international headlines….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here’s the thing: No one can verify this call for executions actually took place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great example of journalism done right, and of how Christians ought to carry ourselves in the public square. It matters whether our facts are right or not— even when the “message” might be right either way. The &lt;a href="http://christandpopculture.com/33-christians-north-korea-really-execution/"&gt;whole thing&lt;/a&gt; is worth your time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems inevitable that our country will try to combat generational poverty and all its great harms by investing heavily in early childhood intervention. We already see signs of the State moving towards such programs with President Obama’s 2013 State of the Union address and Mayor de Blasio’s expanded pre-K. Tragically and despite enormous costs, de Blasio’s pre-K initiative in New York will most likely have very modest results, particularly since it begins intervention at age four, so late in the child’s mental development. The question for the church is, will we allow the state to take the initiative, or will we take up this task and engender the kind of deep, redemptive healing that the state can only dream of?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should (1) &lt;a href="http://www.canonandculture.com/combatting-generational-poverty-through-early-childhood-intervention/"&gt;read the rest of this piece&lt;/a&gt; and (2) read lots more by him and other sharp guys at his homebase &lt;a href="http://christandpopculture.com"&gt;Christ and Pop Culture&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;North Korea tyrant Kim Jong-un has reportedly ordered that 33 Christians believed to be working alongside South Korean Baptist missionary Kim Jung-wook be put to death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N.b. the source is Breitbart, which I usually take with a very large grain of salt—but this is not exactly surprising for Kim Jong-un or North Korea, so it is deserving of further investigation and prayer in any case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a recent study by Ookla Speedtest, the U.S. ranks a shocking 31st in the world in terms of average download speeds. The leaders in the world are Hong Kong at 72.49 Mbps and Singapore on 58.84 Mbps. And America? Averaging speeds of 20.77 Mbps, it falls behind countries like Estonia, Hungary, Slovakia, and Uruguay.&lt;/p&gt;
