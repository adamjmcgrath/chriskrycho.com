&lt;a href="http://www.firebirdsql.org"&gt;FirebirdSQL&lt;/a&gt; configured and ready to use for a project I&amp;#8217;m working on with
&lt;a href="http://www.questconsult.com"&gt;Quest Consultants&lt;/a&gt;. It was slow going. The tool is decent, but the
documentation is spotty and it felt like everything was just a bit of a slog&amp;#8212;to
get it working correctly, to get it playing nicely with other pieces of the
development puzzle, to get it working across platforms.&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Then, because I had
done something a &lt;em&gt;little&lt;/em&gt; bit silly in my eagerness to get up and going last
week and written code without a testable configuration, I hit a wall today. The
queries weren&amp;#8217;t working. I had made a &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22865573/sqlalchemy-successful-insertion-but-then-raises-an-exception"&gt;bug&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent a substantial part of the day chasing down that bug, and then a
conversation with user &lt;em&gt;agronholm&lt;/em&gt; on the &lt;a href="http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/rel_0_9/"&gt;SQLAlchemy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IRC&lt;/span&gt; channel
(&lt;a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/sqlalchemy"&gt;freenode/#sqlalchemy&lt;/a&gt;) got me thinking. The Firebird team describes
one of their options as an &amp;#8220;embedded&amp;#8221; server, but &lt;em&gt;agronholm&lt;/em&gt; pointed out that
what they really mean is &lt;em&gt;portable&lt;/em&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s running a standalone server and
client, but it&amp;#8217;s not part of the same thread/process (like SQLite is). Then
&lt;em&gt;agronholm&lt;/em&gt; very helpfully asked&amp;#8212;my having mentioned my preference for
&lt;a href="http://www.postgresql.org"&gt;PostgreSQL&lt;/a&gt; earlier&amp;#8212;&amp;#8221;Does Postgres not have a portable version?&amp;#8221;
Two minutes later, we had both found &lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/postgresqlportable/"&gt;PostgreSQL Portable&lt;/a&gt;, and I&amp;nbsp;rejoiced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me less than half an hour to get it downloaded and set up and to confirm
that it would work the way we need for this particular piece of software.
(Firebird had taken me a good three hours, what with digging through badly
organized and not terribly clear documentation.) It took me less than half an
hour more to get PostgreSQL to the same point that I&amp;#8217;d finally gotten Firebird
to after multiple hours working with it. And I was so &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; happy. What had
been an especially frustrating work day now had me quietly smiling to myself
constantly for the last two and a half hours as I &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22865573/sqlalchemy-successful-insertion-but-then-raises-an-exception/22872598#22872598"&gt;finished&lt;/a&gt; tracking
down the bug that had set me on this path in the first&amp;nbsp;place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several years ago, when I first started doing web development, I got my feet wet
in database work with MySQL&amp;#8212;probably the single most common starting point for
anyone going that route, courtesy of the ubiquity of the standard Linux-Apache-
MySQL-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; stack.&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; A year after that, I picked up some work that was already
using PostgreSQL and fell in love almost immediately.&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Something just felt
&lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; about running &lt;code&gt;psql&lt;/code&gt; than running &lt;code&gt;mysql&lt;/code&gt; on the command line.
Postgres&amp;#8217; implementation of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SQL&lt;/span&gt; standard felt more natural. Even the tiniest
little details like the way tables display when you query them in &lt;code&gt;psql&lt;/code&gt; was
nicer. In less than a week, I was sold and haven&amp;#8217;t looked back. While I&amp;#8217;ve used
MySQL out of convenience on shared hosting from time to time, PostgreSQL is
unquestionably my preferred database&amp;nbsp;target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&amp;#8217;s experience brought that all home again. That grin on my face all
afternoon felt a bit silly, but it highlights the difference that really good
software design makes. I am not just talking about how it looks here&amp;#8212;though,
to be sure, PostgreSQL is prettier than FirebirdSQL&amp;#8212;but how it works.
PostgreSQL feels responsive, its command set makes a lot of sense and is easy to
use, and it is &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; well documented. In fact, I would go so far as to say
that it is the best documented open source software I have ever used, as well as
among the very most robust. (The only other open source software I find to be as
incredibly rock-solid and reliable as PostgreSQL is the Linux kernel. I am by no
means an expert on either, or on open source software in general, but the Linux
kernel is an unarguably amazing piece of work. So is PostgreSQL.) All those tiny
little details add&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a good reminder for me as I write software that yes, the things I care
about&amp;#8212;the small matters that would be so easy to overlook when customers
express no interest in them&amp;#8212;really do matter. People may not know that things
like typography make a difference in their experience, but those subtle, often
imperceptible things matter. They may not consciously notice the differences in
your interface design (even a command line interface), but it will change their
experience of the software. Do it poorly, or even in a just-good-enough-to-get-
by fashion, and you&amp;#8217;ll annoy or simply bore them. Do it well, and you might just
delight them&amp;#8212;even if they can&amp;#8217;t tell you&amp;nbsp;why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h2 id="examples"&gt;Examples&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make my point a little more visible, I thought it might be useful to post
samples of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SQL&lt;/span&gt; to accomplish the same task in the two different database&amp;nbsp;dialects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="firebirdsql4"&gt;FirebirdSQL:&lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;CREATE TABLE projects (
  id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  title VARCHAR(32) NOT NULL,
  file_name VARCHAR(32) NOT NULL,
  file_location VARCHAR(256) NOT NULL,
  CONSTRAINT unique_file UNIQUE (file_name, file_location)
);
CREATE SEQUENCE project_id_sequence;
SET TERM + ;
CREATE TRIGGER project_id_sequence_update
  ACTIVE BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE POSITION 0
  ON projects
AS
BEGIN
  IF ((new.id IS NULL) OR (new.id = 0))
    THEN new.id = NEXT VALUE FOR project_id_sequence;
END+
SET TERM ; +
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id="postgresql"&gt;PostgreSQL&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;CREATE TABLE projects (
  id SERIAL NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  title VARCHAR(32) NOT NULL,
  file_name VARCHAR(32) NOT NULL,
  file_location VARCHAR(256) NOT NULL,
  CONSTRAINT unique_file UNIQUE (file_name, file_location)
);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not just that the PostgreSQL example is shorter and clearer&amp;#8212;it is that
it is shorter and clearer because its designers and developers have taken the
time to make sure that the shorter, cleaner way works well, and have documented
it so you can know how to use that shorter cleaner way without too much&amp;nbsp;difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do most of my development on a Mac, but do all the testing on the target
platform (Windows) in a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VM&lt;/span&gt;.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, I would only use one of those by default if I were building
a web app: Linux. I&amp;#8217;d use &lt;a href="http://wiki.nginx.org/Main"&gt;nginx&lt;/a&gt; instead of Apache,
&lt;a href="http://www.postgresql.org"&gt;PostgreSQL&lt;/a&gt; instead of MySQL, and &lt;a href="https://www.python.org"&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt; (though
&lt;a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/"&gt;Ruby&lt;/a&gt;, Javascript via &lt;a href="http://nodejs.org"&gt;node.js&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/hh341490"&gt;C# and the .&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NET&lt;/span&gt; stack&lt;/a&gt;,
or just about anything &lt;em&gt;but&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; would do fine).&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Almost&lt;/em&gt; immediately because at that point configuration on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; X was a bit
of a pain. That is &lt;a href="http://postgresapp.com" title="Postgres.app"&gt;no longer the case&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:4"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be perfectly fair to Firebird, it is improving. The upcoming 3.0 series
release will make these two a lot more similar than they are at present, and
clean up a number of other issues. What it won&amp;#8217;t do is get the &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; of
using Firebird more like that of using Postgres, or make the installation
procedure smoother or easier, or make the documentation more complete.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:4" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

internet. I read, to be sure, and every once in a long while I even go on a
spree where I follow links from one site to another (or just in a long trail on
Wikipedia). In general, however, I no longer surf. I suspect I am not alone in
this: if we took a straw poll I would venture that most of my friends offline
and acquaintances online alike spend rather less time in &amp;#8220;browsing&amp;#8221; mode than
they do reading Facebook or Twitter or Instagram. Motion from link to link has
been replaced by individual hops out onto Buzzfeed or a viral cat picture
website.&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The obvious explanation for all of this is already there in what I&amp;#8217;ve written:
Facebook and Twitter and all the rest of the social media web. To be sure, the
advent of social media and the increasing degree to which social media have
captured user attention on the web are a significant factor in the end of the
old surfing/browsing behavior. This is a dream come true for those social media
giants which have found ways to deliver ads to their many millions of users and
thereby turn enormous&amp;nbsp;profits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, I think there is an oft-overlooked factor in the shifting
nature of the web over the last decade: the browser. In fact, if there is any
single cause behind the death of old-fashioned surfing, I would point to Firefox
1.0: the browser which popularized tabbed browsing to increasingly large
sections of the internet-using public.&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The open-source browser steadily ate
away at Internet Explorer&amp;#8217;s then absurd levels of dominance, until Internet
Explorer 8 included of tabs itself. By the time that Chrome came on the scene,
tabbed browsing had long since become a&amp;nbsp;given.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why do I think that &lt;em&gt;tabbed browsing&lt;/em&gt; of all things contributed to the end of
&amp;#8220;browsing&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;surfing&amp;#8221; as our dominant mode of reading the internet? Simply
put: it broke linearity. Previously,&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; one&amp;#8217;s experience of the web was single-
stranded, leaping from one point to another in a line that however contorted was
always connected by the forward and backward buttons on the browser. The moment
tabbed browsing came on the scene, that line was broken. Following a link might
mean it opened in a new tab instead of moving the whole view forward to&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surfing as I remember it in the late &amp;rsquo;90s and early &amp;rsquo;00s was
inherently the experience of getting lost along that timeline, finding myself
dozens of links along the chain and wondering how I had ended up there, and then
being able to trace my way back. With tabs, that traceability was gone. With it
went the inherent tension that we faced with every link: to follow, or not? To
get sucked down into &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; vortex or &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;? Because in all likelihood, we
knew, we were not going to be coming back to this page. With tabs, though, I
could open both of those pages without ever leaving this one. I could start new
journeys without ending the old. But there was a hidden cost: that newly opened
tab had no history. It was a clean slate; before that newly opened link there
was only a blank page. If I closed the original from which I had opened it,
there was no going back.&lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; If I closed this new tabs, there was no going
forward to them. The line was&amp;nbsp;broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there it was only a short step to the idea of a single site being the
center from which one ventured out to other points on the web before returning:
the Facebooks and Twitters of the world. In some sense, Facebook&amp;#8217;s entire model
is predicated on the idea that it is natural to open a new tab with that juicy
Buzzfeed content while keeping Facebook itself open in a background tab. Would
it work in that old linear model? Sort of. Would it feel natural?&amp;nbsp;Never.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this because of tabs. Invention&amp;#8217;s most significant results are rarely
those the minds behind it expect. When we are designing things&amp;#8212;whether a piece
of furniture or a piece of the web&amp;#8212;we have to remember that design decisions
all have repercussions that we may not see. Technology is never neutral.
Particular innovations may or may not be &lt;em&gt;morally&lt;/em&gt; significant, but they always
produce changes in people&amp;#8217;s behavior. Design has&amp;nbsp;consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the record, lots of that hopping from link to link was on Buzzfeed-
like and viral-cat-picture-like sites, too. I am not concerned with the
&lt;em&gt;kind&lt;/em&gt; of content being read here, so much as the way it is being read.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that I am not crediting Firefox 1.0 with &lt;em&gt;creating&lt;/em&gt; the tabbed
browser&amp;#8212;only with popularizing it. That distinction matters.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excepting having multiple browser windows open, which I am sure people
did&amp;#8212;but to a much lesser extent.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:4"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, yes, browser history and re-open closed tab commands. But the
&lt;em&gt;experience&lt;/em&gt; of those is different, and that&amp;#8217;s what we&amp;#8217;re talking about
here.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:4" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
