&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;
Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,
The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere   
The ceremony of innocence is drowned;
The best lack all conviction, while the worst   
Are full of passionate intensity.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Who then devised the torment? Love.
Love is the unfamiliar Name
Behind the hands that wove
The intolerable shirt of flame
Which human power cannot remove.
     We only live, only suspire
     Consumed by either fire or fire.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h1 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This essay will demonstrate that the concluding section of Lamentations 3,
running from v. 40 to v. 66, constitutes an open-ended, multivocal answer to the
question posed in Lamentations 3:39: “Why should a person complain, / a living
man concerning his sins?” The poet did not believe Yahweh demanded silence of
his people, even in the face of his judgment. Rather, his people were to trust
him deeply enough to call out to him, even when all evidence suggested he would
not answer. The point will be demonstrated by a close analysis of the structure,
verbs, and poetic devices employed throughout the text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="authorship"&gt;Authorship&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lamentations has traditionally been attributed to Jeremiah, but the poems
themselves make no claim to authorship whatsoever.&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Jeremianic authorship is
possible, and a few commentators continue to argue for it as a reasonable
assumption.&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; However, while there are commonalities in style and vocabulary
between the books of Jeremiah and Lamentations,&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and no outright
contradictions between the two books,&lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; there are also significant differences
between them. Jeremiah predicted the destruction of the city and the temple
while the author of Lamentations seems surprised by it, and Jeremiah strongly
emphasizes the sins of the people while the author of Lamentations hardly
mentions them.&lt;sup id="fnref:5"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; These differences in perspective might be the result of the
prophet&amp;rsquo;s experience of the fall of Jerusalem as opposed to merely the
anticipation thereof, but more likely whoever composed the book &amp;ldquo;was familiar
with the book of Jeremiah, but had his own vocabulary to express grief over the
fall of Jerusalem.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id="fnref:6"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:6" rel="footnote"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some commentators argue not only against Jeremianic authorship but for multiple
authorship.&lt;sup id="fnref:7"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:7" rel="footnote"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Such a reading is hardly required, however. The suggestion that
variation in perspective or even poetic style can &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; be explained by
multiple authorship badly underestimates the range of human artistry.&lt;sup id="fnref:8"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:8" rel="footnote"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Poetic
voice is not the same as &lt;em&gt;authorial&lt;/em&gt; voice;&lt;sup id="fnref:9"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:9" rel="footnote"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; the multiple voices which appear
throughout the book are &amp;ldquo;poetic vehicles through which the poet speaks
throughout&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id="fnref:10"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:10" rel="footnote"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; rather than multiple authors arguing for differing theologies.
Even if Lamentations is the product of multiple poets, the poems ultimately
represent continuity of thought and theology, both individually and
collectively.&lt;sup id="fnref:11"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:11" rel="footnote"&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Together, they present a multivocal but coherent expression
of grief in the face of horrific tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="context"&gt;Context&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="geographical-and-cultural"&gt;Geographical and Cultural&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lamentations was composed in response to the Babylonian destruction of Jerusalem
and its temple and the deportation of Judean leadership in 595&amp;ndash;587 B.C.
However, it is not clear how long after the fall of Jerusalem the poems were
composed, nor whether they were composed simultaneously or with some gaps
between them. The book was probably composed prior to the rebuilding of the
temple in 515 B.C., since the text includes no hint of such a hopeful turn of
events,&lt;sup id="fnref:12"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:12" rel="footnote"&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; but the author&amp;rsquo;s imaginative and lyrical skill count for more than
his proximity to the events he describes.&lt;sup id="fnref:13"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:13" rel="footnote"&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In any case, the date of
composition is largely irrelevant to the interpretation of the text.&lt;sup id="fnref:14"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:14" rel="footnote"&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the rest of the Hebrew Bible, Lamentations adopts from but freely adapts
genres from the surrounding cultures. Accordingly, it includes elements of
Ancient Near East city laments, communal laments, and communal dirges.&lt;sup id="fnref:15"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:15" rel="footnote"&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
Records of city laments in the greater Mesopotamian region date to the beginning
of the second millennium B.C., and the author of Lamentations joined various
prophetic writers in the Old Testament in repurposing the form for his
theological purposes.&lt;sup id="fnref:16"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:16" rel="footnote"&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Whereas most city-laments appear to have been created
for rededications of temples and thus include the imagery of a god&amp;rsquo;s return to
the temple, Yahweh is conspicuously absent and his temple in ruins throughout
Lamentations.&lt;sup id="fnref:17"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:17" rel="footnote"&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Moreover, the theology of Lamentations differs significantly
from the city-laments. Though the poet gives full voice to doubt and anger
towards Yahweh throughout the book, he ultimately places moral responsibility
not on Yahweh but on the sinning people of Jerusalem, very much unlike the
anti-theodic bent of other city laments.&lt;sup id="fnref:18"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:18" rel="footnote"&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The text mingles &amp;ldquo;penitence &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt;
protest, confession &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; lament.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id="fnref:19"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:19" rel="footnote"&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="literary"&gt;Literary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book consists of five poems, each sharing the same basic acrostic structure.
Chapters 1, 2, and 4 each have twenty-two multi-line verses, each beginning with
a consecutive letter of the Hebrew alphabet.&lt;sup id="fnref:20"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:20" rel="footnote"&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Chapter 3 changes the pattern,
devoting three single-line verses to each letter. Finally, chapter 5 consists of
another twenty-two verses of poetry, but does not include the acrostic lettering
scheme. The acrostics draw the reader forward through the text&lt;sup id="fnref:21"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:21" rel="footnote"&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and express
a sense of completion at their conclusion: grief has been fully sounded and
emotional and theological catharsis experienced.&lt;sup id="fnref:22"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:22" rel="footnote"&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The poet &lt;em&gt;imposes&lt;/em&gt; order
on a world in chaos by choosing to &amp;ldquo;express the inexpressible&amp;hellip; [in poems]
whose controlling structural device is the very letters that signify and give
shape to language.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id="fnref:23"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:23" rel="footnote"&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Moreover, the repetition of letters, as of words and
ideas throughout the poem, &amp;ldquo;introduces the indispensable element of &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt;:
reflection and re-reflection on the meaning of the aesthetic message.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id="fnref:24"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:24" rel="footnote"&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; At
the same time, the frequent use of enjambment both works with the acrostic to
propel the reader forward through the text&lt;sup id="fnref:25"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:25" rel="footnote"&gt;25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and undermines the poetry&amp;rsquo;s
regularity, allowing the poet to control the pace of the poem &amp;ldquo;without relying
on emplottment [sic] or even strong characterization.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id="fnref:26"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:26" rel="footnote"&gt;26&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; These large-scale
poetic devices together shape not only the structure but also the message of the
poetry: lines give different senses when read alone than when read in their
acrostic strophe, and different again when read in the full sequence.&lt;sup id="fnref:27"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:27" rel="footnote"&gt;27&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; They
ultimately &amp;ldquo;draw the reader into a variety of responses&amp;hellip; [not] one particular
response.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id="fnref:28"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:28" rel="footnote"&gt;28&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lamentations 3 is the theological and poetic center of the book.&lt;sup id="fnref:29"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:29" rel="footnote"&gt;29&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Although
some modern commentators hesitate to affirm the centrality of the chapter
because of a tendency to downplay the lament elsewhere in the book,&lt;sup id="fnref:30"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:30" rel="footnote"&gt;30&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; there
are good reasons to take this view. Structurally, the center is often important
to Hebrew poetry, and while that importance can be overstated, the placement of
the poem here should not be ignored&amp;mdash;especially when its poetry and content
differ from the others in such a notable way.&lt;sup id="fnref:31"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:31" rel="footnote"&gt;31&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The increased repetition
heightens the effect and draws attention to the content of the poetry.&lt;sup id="fnref:32"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:32" rel="footnote"&gt;32&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The
shorter lines are visually and aurally arresting. The chapter includes theodic
content and, at times, a hopeful tone&amp;mdash;kinds of content absent in the rest of
the poems. It is also the only poem in which words are attributed to
Yahweh.&lt;sup id="fnref:33"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:33" rel="footnote"&gt;33&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The literary and theological emphasis the poet placed on this
chapter is not a reason to ignore the message of the other chapters, but neither
should it be ignored in interpreting them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chapter has three major sections, though commentators divide them in
slightly different ways; the exegesis below analysis assumes the following
division. In the first section (vv. 1&amp;ndash;18), &amp;ldquo;the man who has seen affliction&amp;rdquo;
(3:1) laments his individual suffering at God&amp;rsquo;s hands. The second section (vv.
19&amp;ndash;39) emphasizes Yahweh&amp;rsquo;s covenant love, trustworthy character, and hatred of
injustice; it is the most hopeful and theodic passage in the book. In the third
section (vv. 40&amp;ndash;66), the speaker responds to the theodic ideas outlined in the
second with a complex mix of complaint, lament, hope, and imprecation. This
concluding turn has led some commentators to suggest the speaker ultimately
could not believe the ethical/theodic message,&lt;sup id="fnref:35"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:35" rel="footnote"&gt;34&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; or that he was angrily
determined to &amp;ldquo;speak in the face of Yahweh&amp;rsquo;s silence;&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id="fnref:36"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:36" rel="footnote"&gt;35&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; it has led others to
suggest competing authors (see above). But &amp;ldquo;[the] speaker is not
schizophrenic.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id="fnref:37"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:37" rel="footnote"&gt;36&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The same person may simultaneously recognize his own sinful
responsibility, trust God, and yet remain long for deliverance from and be
troubled by his suffering.&lt;sup id="fnref:38"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:38" rel="footnote"&gt;37&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Though all of these themes appear scattered
throughout the book, Lamentations 3 alone draws them together in a single poem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final section begins in v. 40. Although there are later topical and vocal
shifts (especially in v. 42; see below), none are as strong as the one leading
the נ-strophe, which is doubly marked. The speaker shifts from general
statements about Yahweh to exhortation of the listening community precisely at
the transition from the מ-strophe to the נ-strophe. Indeed, given the enjambment
across strophe boundaries typical of the final section of the poem,&lt;sup id="fnref:39"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:39" rel="footnote"&gt;38&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; the
alignment here clearly indicates a major transition in the poem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="exegesis"&gt;Exegesis&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id="we-repent-but-god-has-not-forgiven-us-40-51"&gt;We Repent but God Has Not Forgiven Us (40&amp;ndash;51)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speaker has finished his discourse on who Yahweh is and how he acts; now it
is time to respond. In light of the preceding declaration of Yahweh&amp;rsquo;s covenant
love and justice, and its &amp;ldquo;emphasis on confession and penitence&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id="fnref:40"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:40" rel="footnote"&gt;39&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; the
speaker urges his people to turn and repent. He turns almost immediately to a
lengthy lament, however: God has not forgiven. Indeed, the divine warrior has
struck down his own people.&lt;sup id="fnref:41"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:41" rel="footnote"&gt;40&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Things seems hopeless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="let-us-repent-40-42a"&gt;Let us repent! (40&amp;ndash;42a)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Yahweh&amp;rsquo;s covenant love may be trusted and he judges rightly, and if his
people have sinned, they ought to repent. The speaker employs the language of
(especially Jeremianic) prophetic exhortation, calling the people to search out
and examine their ways and return to Yahweh.&lt;sup id="fnref:42"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:42" rel="footnote"&gt;41&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Unlike in Jeremiah, though,
the speaker includes himself in the call to repentance. The opening verbs of the
section are not imperatives but cohortatives (נַחְפְּשָׂ֤ה, נַחְקֹ֔רָה,
נָשׁ֖וּבָה). The speaker thus affirms that his and his people&amp;rsquo;s sin has led to
their current condition; they must repent. The imperfect that follows (נִשָּׂ֤א)
picks up the force of the preceding cohortatives and continues the exhortation.
The language of &amp;ldquo;hearts with hands&amp;rdquo; reminds the reader that the repentance
required is an act of the whole person: neither merely internal nor merely
external.&lt;sup id="fnref:43"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:43" rel="footnote"&gt;42&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The reference to &amp;ldquo;God in heaven&amp;rdquo; does double duty: it marks his
authority to forgive, but it also suggests his absence from Zion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="god-is-still-hidden-42b-44"&gt;God is still hidden (42b&amp;ndash;44)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the following verses, the author begins by confessing sin, then addresses
Yahweh, who has not forgiven his people, and who has instead opposed them and
hidden himself from their prayers. Israel&amp;rsquo;s divine warrior-God has now become
her enemy.&lt;sup id="fnref:44"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:44" rel="footnote"&gt;43&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The God whose presence with his people was so often manifest as
a cloud&lt;sup id="fnref:45"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:45" rel="footnote"&gt;44&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; has now removed his presence from them with a cloud.&lt;sup id="fnref:46"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:46" rel="footnote"&gt;45&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The
people may confess, but unless Yahweh hears their prayers and answers them, they
will remain destitute and hopeless.&lt;sup id="fnref:47"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:47" rel="footnote"&gt;46&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In light of the speaker&amp;rsquo;s confession
and the hope expressed in the preceding major section, that Yahweh has not
forgiven comes as a surprise, and one intensified dramatically by the poetry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the poetry here is enjambed twice, making it one of the more prominent
of the many instances of the poetic device throughout this section of the
poem.&lt;sup id="fnref:48"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:48" rel="footnote"&gt;47&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; First, the poet introduces the address to Yahweh at the end of the
נ-strophe instead of at beginning of the ס-strophe. Second, the poet splits the
line itself. The first verset continues the thought of the preceding two lines:
the people&amp;rsquo;s repentance before God, in the form of confession: &amp;ldquo;we have
transgressed and rebelled.&amp;rdquo; The second verset indicates God&amp;rsquo;s response: &amp;ldquo;&amp;mdash;you
have not forgiven!&amp;rdquo; There is no transition, not even a disjunctive-ו to mark the
shift&amp;mdash;just a terse pair of statements. Indeed, the effect is so jarring,
especially as it leads into the next strophe, that it is tempting to read the
entire rest of the poem as accusation against and anger against God.&lt;sup id="fnref:49"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:49" rel="footnote"&gt;48&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
Understandable as this reading is&amp;mdash;especially as a backlash against the
inappropriate suppression of lament among Christians&amp;mdash;it is mistaken, as will
become clear.&lt;sup id="fnref:50"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:50" rel="footnote"&gt;49&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The speaker &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; complain here and in what follows, but
that is not all he does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the tonal shift between v. 42a and v. 42b, it is possible to read
this as the break between the second and third major sections of the book. As
noted above, the major discourse boundary is between vv. 39 and 40 instead,
where the speaker transitions from exposition to response. There &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a segue
here, as the speaker turns his attention from his community to Yahweh, and
begins a speech section that runs through v. 47, but this transition is within
rather than between sections&amp;mdash;from one kind of response to another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="we-are-devastated-by-our-enemies-45-47"&gt;We are devastated by our enemies (45&amp;ndash;47)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, the poet employs enjambment to drive the reader into the speaker&amp;rsquo;s
experience of suffering. The transition between the ס- and פ-strophes occurs in
v. 46, but already in v. 45 the speaker returns to a theme expressed in the
beginning of the chapter as well as in the preceding poems: enemies attacking
the people of God. Not only is Yahweh absent from Zion, but he has made her like
refuse and waste&lt;sup id="fnref:51"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:51" rel="footnote"&gt;50&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; in the midst of the peoples. The tribes he had chosen to
be a blessing to the nations (Gen. 12:3; 18:17&amp;ndash;19) and set apart as a kingdom
of priests (Exod. 19:6; Deut. 17:18) were defilement&amp;mdash;things to be thrown out
of the camp (cf. Exod. 29:14). Moreover, rather than delivering from enemies,
God has brought them against his people.&lt;sup id="fnref:52"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:52" rel="footnote"&gt;51&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; They have &amp;ldquo;opened their mouths&amp;rdquo;
against God&amp;rsquo;s people, an image used in the Wisdom literature both of speaking
against someone and of devouring them (Job 29:23; Ps. 5:9; 22:13; 35:21). The
climax of the quotation comes in verse 47, a chiasm on two pairs of words which
rhyme almost completely.&lt;sup id="fnref:53"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:53" rel="footnote"&gt;52&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;ldquo;Dread and death, devastation and
ruination&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;this is what Yahweh has accomplished in bringing these enemies
against his people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This judgment may not have been unexpected&amp;mdash;everything that happened to
Jerusalem was expressly the result of a covenant curse&amp;mdash;but the circumstances
were no less horrific for that. That the judgment was deserved did not lessen
the urgency of the speaker&amp;rsquo;s cry for relief.&lt;sup id="fnref:54"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:54" rel="footnote"&gt;53&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The speaker&amp;rsquo;s complaint raises
the poem&amp;rsquo;s tension by pitting this lament against the theodic material which
precedes it.&lt;sup id="fnref:55"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:55" rel="footnote"&gt;54&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The speaker may not be shaking his fist at the heavens, but he
is certainly complaining loudly and questioning insistently. If Yahweh is
loving, faithful, and just, is this judgment not too harsh? At this point, the
ethical vision expressed in vv. 19&amp;ndash;39 seems lost. Indeed, Miriam Bier and F. W.
Dobbs-Allsopp both suggest that the poet &lt;em&gt;wants&lt;/em&gt; to embrace the ethical vision,
but that this and the section following demonstrate his inability to do so.&lt;sup id="fnref:56"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:56" rel="footnote"&gt;55&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
Were this the final note of the poem, this analysis would be basically correct.
It is not, but things get worse before they get better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sight-and-salvation-48-51"&gt;Sight and salvation (48&amp;ndash;51)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speaker echoes the end of v. 47 at the end of v. 48, tying the two together,
but shifts in person (from &amp;ldquo;we&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo;).&lt;sup id="fnref:57"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:57" rel="footnote"&gt;56&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The identity of the speaker shifts
slightly as a result: he spoke first for himself alone, then exhorted his
community, and now stands in solidarity with the community of Zion.&lt;sup id="fnref:58"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:58" rel="footnote"&gt;57&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The
poet connects these verses, from the last line of the פ-strophe through the
whole ע-strophe, with the idea of eyes and sight. The poet&amp;rsquo;s eyes pour out
channels of water and flow without ceasing or respite, until Yahweh looks and
sees. The poet and his people desperately need Yahweh&amp;rsquo;s deliverance&amp;mdash;and Yahweh
remains enthroned in heaven. The poet carefully reiterates the idea suggested in
the נ-strophe, delaying the subject of v. 50 to the second half of the line to
match the structure of v. 41. The inclusio emphasizes both Yahweh&amp;rsquo;s sovereignty
and his distance from his people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until Yahweh sees&amp;mdash;until he stops shrouding himself from his people&amp;rsquo;s prayers
and hears their cries as he did in Exodus 1&amp;mdash;the poet&amp;rsquo;s eyes continue to
torment him because of the sad state of the women of the city (v. 51). The final
line is curiously expressive: the speaker&amp;rsquo;s eyes are harsh to his soul&amp;mdash;a
phrase that has been taken to mean that his eyes literally ache from his crying
and that the things he sees torment him.&lt;sup id="fnref:59"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:59" rel="footnote"&gt;58&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In fact, the terse language
suggests both: in the immediate context, the speaker&amp;rsquo;s weeping wears him out;
more broadly, soul-distressing suffering is nearly omnipresent in these poems.
Although he clearly hopes for change, he is no longer addressing Yahweh as of v.
48. He simply states how things are and will remain until God acts: these
horrors demand grief. And perhaps Yahweh will hear these tears, even if he seems
to have heard nothing else (though nothing in the context or language here
suggests these tears are meant to &lt;em&gt;manipulate&lt;/em&gt; God into responding).&lt;sup id="fnref:60"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:60" rel="footnote"&gt;59&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The
section closes without any such response, though; all hope seems lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="deliver-me-from-my-enemies-52-66"&gt;Deliver me from my enemies! (52&amp;ndash;66)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concluding section is like an individual psalm of lament.&lt;sup id="fnref:61"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:61" rel="footnote"&gt;60&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It continues
the shift begun in v. 19. The chapter (as well as the book) opens with the image
of God as a divine warrior fighting against his people, but it concludes with a
plea for God to act in line with his character.&lt;sup id="fnref:62"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:62" rel="footnote"&gt;61&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The speaker hopes that
Yahweh will restore his people to covenant unity with him and defend them from
their enemies, but refuses to collapse the tension between hope and lament that
characterizes the whole poem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="excursus-verb-tense-and-meaning-in-poetry"&gt;Excursus: Verb Tense and Meaning in Poetry&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The verb tense throughout the final section of the poem is a subject of much
debate. Commentators differ especially on how to take the mix of perfects and
imperfects in vv. 56&amp;ndash;58, but significant differences appear beginning as early
as v. 52. Some take the verbs to be a mix of past statement and present need or
imperative,&lt;sup id="fnref:63"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:63" rel="footnote"&gt;62&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; but this does not account for the ongoing nature of the
speaker&amp;rsquo;s distress (as indicated by the imperatives in the following
section).&lt;sup id="fnref:64"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:64" rel="footnote"&gt;63&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Others read both the perfects and imperfects as a series of
present-tense declarations of faith.&lt;sup id="fnref:65"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:65" rel="footnote"&gt;64&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This view rightly captures the sense
of present distress, but does not account for the perfect-imperfect alternation
and has no basis for distinguishing between these &amp;ldquo;present-tense&amp;rdquo; perfects and
the ordinary past-tense perfects that precede them. Thus, some suggest that the
perfects carry a precative sense, with the imperfects then naturally reading as
more imperatives.&lt;sup id="fnref:66"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:66" rel="footnote"&gt;65&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In addition to being an unusual and debated syntactical
stance, however, this also fails to answer why the poet did not use simple
imperatives (as in vv. 59, 63). Even if these verbs simply represent the poet
shifting to the perfect-imperfect alternation common to poetry,&lt;sup id="fnref:67"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:67" rel="footnote"&gt;66&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; this is the
only place in the entire final section of the poem where the pattern appears. At
the least, it marks the sequence by distinction with the surrounding verses.
Thus, none of the proposals satisfactorily account for all the features of the
text, though perfect-as-precative is not unreasonable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is possible, of course, that this ambiguity is a function only of modern
scholars&amp;rsquo; relative ignorance of the language&amp;mdash;that native speakers readily took
in the meaning of the poetry when Lamentations was written. It is equally
plausible, however, that the poet &lt;em&gt;intended&lt;/em&gt; the meaning to remain elusive. This
is one of the functions of poetry: to push the boundaries of what language can
express and thereby convey feeling and sense beyond the merely literal. The poet
in Lamentations employs a wide array of tools to this end in this final section
of the poem, including structure (the acrostic), enjambment, rhythm, rhyme and
assonance, ellipsis, and allusion. Perhaps the poet wanted audience to wonder:
has Yahweh delivered already, spoken already, judged the enemies already&amp;mdash;or is
the speaker still waiting for Yahweh to hear his prayers? In the world of faith,
the answer may be &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt;: the believer may be fully confident that Yahweh&amp;rsquo;s
answer is assured, and still feel no less keenly the fact that experience does
not yet bear out that answer. The text is open; it not only allows for but
actively invites both readings.&lt;sup id="fnref:68"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:68" rel="footnote"&gt;67&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;ldquo;[Both] past and future signify the
ongoing present. The suffering in Lamentations is timeless, and the expression
of timelessness seems to have been one of the poet’s goals.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id="fnref:69"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:69" rel="footnote"&gt;68&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="my-enemies-despair-and-pleading-52-55"&gt;My enemies! Despair and pleading (52&amp;ndash;55)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The צ-strophe opens with a stereotyped image of the beleaguered servant of God:
the person hunted like a bird (cf. Prov. 6:5; Pss. 11:1, 124:7, 140:5) by those
who hated him for no reason (cf. 1 Sam. 19:15, 25:31; Ps. 35:7, 69:5). The
strophe continues with a description of the enemies&amp;rsquo; depredations. The
circuitous language (literally, they put an end to his life, with the action
occurring in a pit) conveys the idea of people seeking to end his life by
throwing him into a pit and hurling stones at him (cf. Pss. 18:41, 73:27,
94:23).&lt;sup id="fnref:70"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:70" rel="footnote"&gt;69&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The image is not a dry pit like the ones Joseph and Jeremiah were
thrown into (Gen. 38:24; Jer. 38:6). Instead, water went up over the speaker&amp;rsquo;s
head (cf. Ps: 69:1&amp;ndash;2). Besides being yet more stock lament imagery,&lt;sup id="fnref:71"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:71" rel="footnote"&gt;70&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; the
water language connects this sequence back to the preceding one, even as the
focus has changed. So likewise with the &amp;ldquo;pit&amp;rdquo; language, whose implied
metaphorical use as a substitute for death or the grave&lt;sup id="fnref:72"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:72" rel="footnote"&gt;71&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; is heightened by
proximity to v. 47, where it is used precisely that way. The poetry is also
enjambed again much as it was at the end of the נ-strophe. The first half of the
line in v. 54 continues the complaint theme of the preceding verses, but the
latter half begins a recitation of speech to and interaction with Yahweh. The
poet carries this theme further as he begins the ק-strophe (v. 55) with the
speaker&amp;rsquo;s having cried out Yahweh&amp;rsquo;s name from the &amp;ldquo;deepest pit,&amp;rdquo; a phrase
suggestive of Sheol.&lt;sup id="fnref:73"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:73" rel="footnote"&gt;72&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing about these verses is particularly striking or unusual next to other
laments in the Old Testament, and this is in its own way significant. The
speaker has made a small but meaningful change in his language and tone: Yahweh
is no longer the enemy but instead the one who might deliver &lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt; the
enemies.&lt;sup id="fnref:74"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:74" rel="footnote"&gt;73&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The turn to traditional, even stereotyped, language of lament and
petition signals the speaker&amp;rsquo;s self-conscious identification with Israel&amp;rsquo;s
history of trusting Yahweh for deliverance. This does not mark the resolution of
the trial, but it does undercut the idea that the end of the poem is
unrelentingly pessimistic&amp;mdash;especially when coupled with the verses that follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="yahweh-hearsmay-yahweh-hear-56-58"&gt;Yahweh hears/May Yahweh hear (56&amp;ndash;58)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next sequence (continuing the ק-strophe and running into the first line of
the ר-strophe) is a striking sequence and is key to understanding the poet&amp;rsquo;s
intent in the final section of the poem. The speaker proclaims Yahweh&amp;rsquo;s response
to his call for help from the edge of death. Per the discussion above, this
section is best read as holding together the tensions of past-and-future,
actual-and-desired: &amp;ldquo;you heard my voice&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;hear my voice&amp;rdquo; (v. 56); &amp;ldquo;you came
on the day I called&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;come on the day I call,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;you said to me&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;say to
me&amp;rdquo; (v. 57); &amp;ldquo;you strove for my life&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;strive for my life&amp;rdquo; (v. 58). This is
the climax of the final section, the place where the poet&amp;rsquo;s pleas climax and,
more significantly, the only place in the entire book where Yahweh speaks. The
words the poet attributes to Yahweh are simple&amp;mdash;אַל־תִּירָֽא, &amp;ldquo;do not
fear&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;but pack depths into their brief syllables. For the canonically
attentive reader, these words immediately call to mind all the places Yahweh
tells his people not to fear, and where he inevitably promised his presence and
his aid to his people against their enemies.&lt;sup id="fnref:75"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:75" rel="footnote"&gt;74&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Yet the poet elides the second
part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is impossible to take the poet&amp;rsquo;s intended sense without paying attention to
&amp;ldquo;the way in which the sequence as a whole coheres and interacts, and even to how
the poet articulates theological interests.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id="fnref:76"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:76" rel="footnote"&gt;75&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This allusion grounds the
final segment of the poem in a measure of hope. At the same time, by leaving the
promise of Yahweh&amp;rsquo;s presence merely an allusion, rather than stating it straight
out, the poet carefully sustains the tension between &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;not-yet&lt;/em&gt;
that drives the conclusion of the poem. Turn the phrases one way, and the
speaker is pleading for God to comfort his people by making his presence known;
turn them the other and the speaker is proclaiming that this is precisely what
God has already done. Both perspectives affirm the community&amp;rsquo;s need for
deliverance and for Yahweh&amp;rsquo;s presence to return; but the poetry hangs between
the two, unresolved. The poet has left both readings possible, perhaps even
necessary. Complaint remains,&lt;sup id="fnref:77"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:77" rel="footnote"&gt;76&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; yet Israel&amp;rsquo;s hope that Yahweh was and would
be with them remains, too.&lt;sup id="fnref:78"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:78" rel="footnote"&gt;77&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="may-yahweh-judge-the-enemies-59-66"&gt;May Yahweh judge the enemies (59&amp;ndash;66)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The poem concludes with the resumption of the speaker&amp;rsquo;s complaint about the
enemies, followed by an imprecatory prayer against them; both the complaint and
the imprecation echo the imprecatory psalms.&lt;sup id="fnref:79"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:79" rel="footnote"&gt;78&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The only two imperatives
proper in vv. 40&amp;ndash;66 appear here: the speaker pleads with God to judge his case
(v. 59) and to observe his enemies&amp;rsquo; actions (v. 63). In the complaint, which
takes up the final line of the ר-strophe and the entire ש-strophe, he lists out
his enemies&amp;rsquo; offenses. They sought (unwarranted) vengeance on, connived against,
reproached, rose up against, slandered, plotted against, and made a mockery of
him (cf. 14:16&amp;ndash;17, 23:7).&lt;sup id="fnref:80"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:80" rel="footnote"&gt;79&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The lines are terse and elliptical, with verbs
few and far between; the result reads like a list of charges in a court case,
crying out for a verdict.&lt;sup id="fnref:81"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:81" rel="footnote"&gt;80&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The imprecatory prayer comprises the ת-strophe, where a series of imperfects
take up an imperatival force. The only unusual item in the list is the phrase
translated &amp;ldquo;obstinate hearts,&amp;rdquo; מְגִנַּת, a hapax which appears only here and may
be derived from מָגֵן, &amp;ldquo;shield.&amp;rdquo; Literally, the speaker asks for Yahweh to give
them something like &amp;ldquo;covering-of-heart&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;the idea seems to be hard-heartedness
(thus &amp;ldquo;obstinate&amp;rdquo;)&amp;mdash;so that the enemies will receive the judgment they are due
(cf. Exo. 7:3,13).&lt;sup id="fnref:82"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:82" rel="footnote"&gt;81&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; These imprecations are not merely selfish requests for
personal vengeance. Rather, they are a plea for Yahweh to execute divine
justice, in line with his character as speaker described it in the middle
section of the poem.&lt;sup id="fnref:83"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:83" rel="footnote"&gt;82&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It is not that the poet thinks that his proclamation
of faith resolved everything. Instead, echoing both the Psalms and
Jeremiah,&lt;sup id="fnref:85"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:85" rel="footnote"&gt;83&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; the speaker implores Yahweh for deliverance, confident that God
&lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; help but desperately needing that ability to become action.&lt;sup id="fnref:86"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:86" rel="footnote"&gt;84&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The poem ends on an unresolved note, unlike most of the psalms of imprecation or
lament (notable exceptions including Pss. 44, 60).&lt;sup id="fnref:87"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:87" rel="footnote"&gt;85&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; But this is appropriate
to the poet&amp;rsquo;s aims. He presents not a cheery resolve to act as though everything
is better in light of the ethical and theodic vision presented in vv. 19&amp;ndash;39,
but rather an attempt to apply that vision when circumstances remain
unchanged.&lt;sup id="fnref:88"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:88" rel="footnote"&gt;86&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The result is closure, but not resolution. The acrostic is
complete, and the speaker&amp;rsquo;s grief has been expiated to a degree&amp;mdash;but until
things are right again, pleading and lament remain. Yahweh may be good and his
judgments righteous, but that does not require his people&amp;rsquo;s silence when he
punishes them. To the contrary, it allows them to express their grief and anger
in the hope of a merciful and gracious response from their covenant God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reading makes sense of the shape of the poem as a whole. Because of the
brighter notes sounded in vv. 19&amp;ndash;39, a few commentators take this poem as
ending positively.&lt;sup id="fnref:89"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:89" rel="footnote"&gt;87&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Others take the final 26 verses as a negative response
to the (apparently) rhetorical questions posed in vv. 36&amp;ndash;39.&lt;sup id="fnref:90"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:90" rel="footnote"&gt;88&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Neither of
these readings does justice to the tension of the poetry. Instead, the poet has
played the enjambment card again, at a yet larger level. The final (originally
rhetorical) question of the middle section actually received an answer: Why
should a man complain about the punishment of his sins? Because even when the
judgment was deserved, Yahweh may yet answer, silence the enemy, and draw near
to his people. In one sense, he already has; in another, his people are still
waiting&amp;mdash;and the poet leaves it at that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="application"&gt;Application&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent decades, scholars have applied Lamentations to everything from
Freudian grief models&lt;sup id="fnref:91"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:91" rel="footnote"&gt;89&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to massive national tragedies.&lt;sup id="fnref:92"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:92" rel="footnote"&gt;90&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The Freudian
model of grief has some serious deficiencies&amp;mdash;but applications of Lamentations
3 in that context do help people both to articulate their grief and  to respond
to loss.&lt;sup id="fnref:93"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:93" rel="footnote"&gt;91&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Application to national tragedies is even more appropriate. The
20th and 21st centuries have seen horrific loss of life; even in largely
untouched America, community has disintegrated over the same period. Thus, &amp;ldquo;the
unrelenting relevance of this poetry cries out to be heard and understood.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id="fnref:94"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:94" rel="footnote"&gt;92&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
Reading Lamentations more frequently and deeply will help Western Christians
understand the trials of fellow believers enduring persecution for the name of
Christ. It will also provide a framework for sympathizing with peoples around
the world facing ethnic cleansing or other such horrors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These realities are painful, but they are realities nonetheless. With some of
the Psalms, Lamentations addresses human suffering head-on as few other places
in Scripture do, pointing the way to a deep, rich, honest, and trusting response
to tragedy. The concluding section of chapter 3 is particularly helpful: God
sometimes delays his deliverance; repentance does not always lead immediately to
restoration; and the enemies of God&amp;rsquo;s people go on harassing them far longer
than seems right. In those moments, people and their pastors have a model to
follow: crying out to God as long as his answer remains &lt;em&gt;already-but-not-yet&lt;/em&gt;.
Believers ought to spend time reading, meditating on, and praying through these
words. Pastors should acquaint themselves with the book deeply so they can
minister to their congregants facing trials, and they should preach on it more
often to equip their congregations for those trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lamentations 3:40&amp;ndash;66 represents an invitation to cry out to God even in the
midst of judgment&amp;mdash;to believe that he may yet hear. In their hesitation to
voice this kind of lament at in the face of life&amp;rsquo;s travails, many Christians
reveal that they do not know their God as well as they ought. &amp;ldquo;The suffering is,
as it were, an affirmation that God is still there and still concerned with the
fate of Israel. He may hide his face, but he has not ceased to be Israel’s
God.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id="fnref:95"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:95" rel="footnote"&gt;93&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; If even God&amp;rsquo;s judgment on Israel was a painful picture of his
faithfulness, how much more when he has shared our griefs, borne our sufferings
in his own flesh, and been judged to the point of crying out, &amp;ldquo;My God, my God,
why have you forsaken me?&amp;rdquo; And so he remains open to his people&amp;rsquo;s cries&amp;mdash;for,
until suffering ends, lament remains.&lt;/p&gt;

Div.</category><category>papers</category></item><item><title>An Uncomfortable Fit</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2015/an-uncomfortable-fit.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I grew up in a small, non-denominational, baptistic, charismatic church.
Speaking in tongues, the use of private prayer languages, claims to words of
knowledge and prophecies, and the expectation of miraculous healings were
common. Unfortunately, even granting a continuationist view of the gifts, the
church&amp;rsquo;s practice was never in line with New Testament guidelines for the
gifts&amp;mdash;no translation of tongues, for example, or requirement that prophecy be
fulfilled for the prophet to be judged true. I grew disillusioned with the
charismatic approach to the gifts by late high school, and spent several of the
following years as a near-cessationist. I remain skeptical of most charismatic
churches&amp;rsquo; practice of the gifts, but am not a cessationist: I see no compelling
exegetical argument for the position. I am especially open to the likelihood of
the miraculous gifts in frontier missions context, where they serve to validate
the proclamation of the gospel over and above demonic powers worshipped in
polytheistic, animistic, and shamanistic cultures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In college, I spent two years attending a fairly traditional Southern Baptist
church. For the latter half of my time in college and the three years following,
I was a member of a non-demoninational, baptistic, broadly evangelical church
with my wife Jaimie. During that time, I remained baptistic, but began to become
concerned with the lack of confessional moorings in most baptistic churches
(denominational or non-denominational alike). Along the way, I shifted from the
non-Calvinistic views held by most charismatics and Baptists to an Edwardsian
Calvinism and developed stronger convictions about church polity. Finally, since
moving to North Carolina, we have been committed members at First Baptist Church
of Durham&amp;mdash;a healthy, elder-led, Calvinistic Southern Baptist church that we
love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, even here, we find that we are not totally &amp;ldquo;at home&amp;rdquo;; it is not quite
right to call even Calvinistic Southern Baptists &amp;ldquo;my tradition&amp;rdquo;. Indeed, it is
perhaps most accurate to say that I have not yet &lt;em&gt;found&lt;/em&gt; my tradition. What I
have found instead are points to appreciate in a number of traditions, and an
increasing identification (at least from the outside) with many elements of the
Presbyterian tradition. A friend once described me as a &amp;ldquo;Pres-matic Bapt-erian&amp;rdquo;,
and he seems to have been right. I find much to appreciate in the charismatic
background from which I sprang, and much to value in the Baptist tradition where
I currently live&amp;mdash;but at the end of the day, it is only my credobaptist
convictions keeping me within the Baptist world, rather than transitioning into
Presbyterianism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the charismatic tradition in which I grew up, I learned the value of
affections oriented toward Christ. It is not enough to &lt;em&gt;understand&lt;/em&gt; the things
of God; we must also love him and one another. Our faith must be true &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt;
experiential. John reminds us that &amp;ldquo;this is eternal life, that they know you the
only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent&amp;rdquo; (John 17:3) and that
&amp;ldquo;Whoever says he is in the light and hates his brother is still in darkness&amp;rdquo; (1
John 2:9). Moreover, they emphasized that walking in the Holy Spirit is
essential to the healthy Christian life. Though I might now characterize the
Spirit&amp;rsquo;s primary work differently from the church of my childhood, I still
affirm whole-heartedly that the Christian life is deeply and profoundly
dependent on the Holy Spirit. Paul enjoins us, &amp;ldquo;But I say, walk by the Spirit,
and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh.... If we live by the Spirit,
let us also keep in step with the Spirit&amp;rdquo; (Galatians 5:16, 25). Likewise, John
reports Jesus&amp;rsquo; shocking statement that it is &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; for us that he left and
sent the Spirit than that he should have remained with us (John 16:7ff.). The
life of the Christian must be a Spirit-filled and Spirit-empowered life. We can
never overemphasize the work of the Spirit in our lives (though we may sometimes
articulate that work inaccurately).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the Southern Baptist churches I have attended I have gained a deeper
appreciation for the importance of evangelism and missions. Whether from the
Great Commission in Matthew 28:18&amp;ndash;20 or the similar notes sounded in Luke
24:45&amp;ndash;49 and then throughout the book of Acts, it is clear that God&amp;rsquo;s people
are called to evangelize wherever we go. (Closely related to the above point,
however, this is not mere salesmanship. As Luke points out in Acts 1:8, the
power for the church&amp;rsquo;s missionary work is the Holy Spirit, not human wisdom.) If
the church forgets that her first and foremost calling is the proclamation of
the gospel to all the nations, she will rapidly fall off the cart in one
direction or another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The historic Baptist emphasis on regenerate church membership and the
congregation&amp;rsquo;s responsibility for discipline are also essential ingredients to
healthy, flourishing churches (and therefore for flourishing individual
Christians). The countless &amp;ldquo;one another&amp;rdquo; passages of the New Testament (e.g.
John 13:34&amp;ndash;35, Ephesians 4:25&amp;ndash;32) emphasize mutual service as an essential
mark of Christian fellowship. Moreover, the well-known church discipline
passages (Matthew 18:15&amp;ndash;20) indicate clearly that the members of a congregation
are to look out for each other&amp;rsquo;s spiritual well-being. Although this care has
sometimes been twisted to abuse in other churches, we are blessed to participate
in a context where the passages&amp;rsquo; emphasis on forgiveness and restoration is kept
front and center. Meaningful membership and congregational care through church
discipline are not universally popular, but they are among the hallmarks of our
particular corner of the Southern Baptist convention. This kind of care for the
saints is not only necessary: it is &lt;em&gt;beautiful&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From my Presbyterian friends I have increasingly come to appreciate a more
thoroughly confessional identity and the value of churches connected not only by
sharing funds but also by polity. Acts 15 highlights that the early church
resolved its most significant outstanding tension not by letting each church go
its own way doctrinally, but by issuing a decision that was binding on &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the
churches. Granted: the presence of the apostles then means our situation is not
identical. Still, the event demands attention. Even a church with the
illustrious history and (apostolic!) leadership of the congregation at Antioch
did not feel equipped to make serious doctrinal decisions without consulting the
rest of the church. This is not to deny that there are clear marks of local
congregational responsibility throughout the epistles, only that the New
Testament pattern was of churches in active contact, cooperation, and doctrinal
dependence with each other in a way that appears &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; similar to a
proto-presbytery, and quite unlike the radical autonomy of Baptist churches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also find the historic Reformed articulation of the relationship between the
various spheres of life extremely compelling. Calvin and his heirs often
advocated clearly and coherently for the goodness of the created order and for
human activity therein. Here, vocation (including the arts) is taken not merely
as a means to gospel proclamation, but as genuinely good in itself. This theme
runs throughout Scripture: God commanded man to work before the Fall (cf.
Genesis 2:5,15), and though work has been corrupted and made toilsome by the
Fall, it remains good. The world itself was created good (Genesis 1), and though
it groans with us for redemption (Romans 8:19&amp;ndash;23) it still proclaims the glory
of God (see Psalm 19 for just one of many examples). Many evangelicals pay lip
service to the goodness of creation and vocation, but few outside the high
church traditions (especially Anglican, Lutheran, and Presbyterian) carry the
doctrine through in their practice. This leaves me hungry for the kind of
intellectual, vocational, and artistic engagement I see in those traditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From late modern evangelicalism more broadly I have imbibed both my essential
Christian temperament&amp;mdash;my unsettled, &amp;ldquo;post-denominational&amp;rdquo; eccesiastical
identity included!&amp;mdash;and two other essential ingredients: a sense of
catholicity, and a desire to do more and better in caring for &amp;ldquo;the least of
these.&amp;rdquo; Set against Jesus&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;new command&amp;rdquo; in John 13, the divisions within the
church are painful realities we should strive to see undone wherever possible.
Our disagreements are not trivial; we cannot simply toss them aside. We can,
however, glory in our common experience of &amp;ldquo;mere Christianity&amp;rdquo; and take
opportunities where possible to worship our risen Lord together. We can also
work together across denominational boundaries to care for the orphans and
widows (James 1:27), to confront injustice in this age. The needs of the world
around us are severe and painful; the various wings of the church can and should
unite to bring what tastes we can of the justice and mercy of Christ&amp;rsquo;s kingdom
into the present age&amp;mdash;in the church, and everywhere else (Micah 6:8).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, and perhaps most importantly, I have found in &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of these movements
a consistent emphasis on the centrality, authority, and sufficiency of
Scripture. From my charismatic, Arminian-leaning youth minister to the pastors
of the middle-America Bible church I attended during and after college to the
elders of Calvinistic Baptist church we now call home, all have pointed
consistently to God&amp;rsquo;s word as his ultimate self-revelation. These churches have&lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; lived out a commitment to the idea that God&amp;rsquo;s word is living and active
(Hebrews 4:12) and profitable in every way (2 Timothy 3:16&amp;ndash;17).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the number of shifts in my past, the transition to
another tradition would be relatively straightforward; apart from the issue of
believer&amp;rsquo;s baptism, Presbyterianism looks quite appealing even now. Even beyond
these more important convictional differences, I do not fit comfortably within
the Baptistic tradition culturally. Its populism often verges on (and sometimes
crosses into) anti-intellectualism. Its broadly helpful focus on evangelism and
missions too often translates into a reductive approach that reduces all spheres
of life to vehicles for gospel-proclamation&amp;mdash;not recognizing that while in
God&amp;rsquo;s providence they often serve as such, the myriad spheres of life are good
in their own right. The Southern Baptist identification with the culture of the
South is also problematic for someone culturally not a Southerner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discussions on the nature of the church and the history of the Baptist movement
in this class have largely solidified my pre-existing discomfort within the
Baptist tradition and somewhat intensified the struggle to define my
ecclesiastical identity. The theological commitments and cultural habits of
(especially Southern) Baptists trouble me deeply. Reading &lt;em&gt;The Baptist Way&lt;/em&gt; had
precisely the opposite effect Norman intended: his polemical rhetoric bore the
marks of profound ignorance of other traditions. Much of the reading on
believers&amp;rsquo; baptism was similarly dismissive&amp;mdash;arguing not against the substance
of other positions, but instead against caricatures thereof. Dockery&amp;rsquo;s call for
renewal and consensus was more helpful, but it, too, had a sectarian bent. The
denomination&amp;rsquo;s (and the broader tradition&amp;rsquo;s) deep anti-intellectualism and
lasting suspicion of creeds and confessions make it unlikely that Southern
Baptists will be able to claim the confessional identity or theological
consensus they need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is an unfortunate reality that my experience of Baptists has too often been
marked by denominational sectarianism,  anti-intellectualism and
anti-creedalism, and reductionistic and utilitarian approaches to God&amp;rsquo;s world.
To be sure, there are exceptions to these trends, and I am grateful for them.
But it means that, credobaptist though I am, &amp;ldquo;Baptist&amp;rdquo; and especially &amp;ldquo;Southern
Baptist&amp;rdquo; are not and cannot be my ecclesiastical &lt;em&gt;identity&lt;/em&gt; unless they comes to
mean something very different than they have for many years. In the meantime, I
will remain a &amp;ldquo;Pres-matic Bap-terian&amp;rdquo;, and deeply grateful for the traditions
that have shaped me and especially our current church&amp;mdash;even when they are not a
&amp;ldquo;perfect fit&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chris Krycho</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 25 Apr 2015 10:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:www.chriskrycho.com,2015-04-25:2015/an-uncomfortable-fit.html</guid><category>M.

&lt;p&gt;There are only two practices embraced universally throughout the Christian
church: baptism and the Lord&amp;rsquo;s Supper. Even with these, serious differences
remain, reflecting deeper distinctions in the theology and practice of the
church. In the case of baptism, the questions of its meaning and mode tend to
reflect the believer&amp;rsquo;s views on the nature of God&amp;rsquo;s saving work, the covenant
community, and the church. Who should be baptized, and how, where, and under
what circumstances are difficult, important questions. Believers must consider
them carefully and hold their conclusions humbly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="baptismal-theology"&gt;Baptismal Theology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baptism should be applied to believers, and is best carried out by immersion.
However, while Baptist churches have often tended toward a dogmatic position on
these, leading to a frequent practice of rebaptism, more caution is
necessary&amp;mdash;especially on the second point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="meaning"&gt;Meaning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baptism is the covenant sign of one&amp;rsquo;s entrance into the Christian faith, and
also a means of grace in the life of the Christian&amp;mdash;not &lt;em&gt;saving&lt;/em&gt; grace, but
real grace nonetheless, in the same way that fellowship with the saints, the
preaching of the word, and the Lord&amp;rsquo;s supper are.&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; God works grace in the
life of believers in their obedience to his commands, of which baptism is among
the clearest in the New Testament (Matt. 28:18&amp;ndash;20, Acts 2:38). Moreover, it is
the symbol and in some mysterious way also a means of the believer&amp;rsquo;s union with
Christ in his death and resurrection (Rom. 6:3&amp;ndash;4, Col. 2:8&amp;ndash;14), an element of
his union with Christ&amp;rsquo;s church (Eph. 4:4&amp;ndash;6), and his appeal to God for a pure
conscience (1 Pet. 3:21&amp;ndash;22).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baptism is not merely a symbolic ordinance&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; but, as these passages make
clear, a place in which God works uniquely in the life of the believer. Neither
is paptism a work necessary for salvation, as is clear from the salvation of the
thief on the cross (Luke 23:42&amp;ndash;43, as well as from many other places that teach
that faith alone is necessary for salvation). Nor is there warrant in Scripture
for the idea that baptism is a means of regeneration or cleansing from original
sin. Nonetheless, paptism is ordinarily a part of God&amp;rsquo;s saving work in his
people&amp;rsquo;s lives. The reality that some are saved who are never baptized does not
mean it plays no part in the believer&amp;rsquo;s life, but rather that its part is in&lt;em&gt;sanctification&lt;/em&gt; rather than in &lt;em&gt;justification&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mode"&gt;Mode&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly all Baptists historically have argued on the basis of the New Testament
language that baptism &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be by immersion. The word βαπτίζω, usually
transliterated to English as &amp;ldquo;baptize&amp;rdquo; rather than translated, is a secondary
verb derived from the root βάπτω, broadly meaning simply &amp;ldquo;to dip or immerse.&amp;rdquo;
While a full exegetical treatment is beyond the scope of this essay, two points
must be remembered in any discussion of baptism. First, the normal meaning of
both these words &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; dipping or immersion, and there are a number of examples
which strongly suggest going down into and coming up out of standing water
(Matt. 3:6&amp;ndash;17, Mark 1:4&amp;ndash;11, John 3:22, Acts 8:36&amp;ndash;39). Second, however, the
lexical domain of these verbs and of the various words derived from them within
the New Testament alone is broader than dipping or immersion, and certainly
includes the notion of washing.&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, its figurative uses throughout the New Testament range far more
broadly than &amp;ldquo;immersion&amp;rdquo; alone: it includes partaking of trials (Mark 10:38,
Luke 12:50); the transfoming work of the Spirit (Matt. 3:11, Acts 1:5, Acts
11:16), and even the Israelites&amp;rsquo; passing through water without getting wet (1
Cor. 10:2). The most significant of these metaphorical texts is Paul&amp;rsquo;s argument
that in baptism believers have been united with Christ in his death and
resurrection (Rom. 6:3&amp;ndash;4, Col. 2:8&amp;ndash;14). The parallel imagery between the two
is clear and potent: baptism visualizes death and resurrection. However, Paul&amp;rsquo;s
parallel uses of the word &amp;ldquo;baptism&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;baptize&amp;rdquo; (e.g. 1 Cor. 12:13, Gal. 3:27)
with &amp;ldquo;in Christ&amp;rdquo; demonstrate that the point of these passages is union with
Christ&amp;mdash;not mode of baptism. Immersion illustrates this reality most
effectively, but immersion is not commanded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be granted, then, that the primary meaning of the word group is of
dipping or immersion, but that it also includes a broader sense of washing or
transformation. Likewise, given what documents there are from the first and
second century, it seems safe to say that baptism was normally by immersion in
the early church. However, it is too much to say that immersion is &lt;em&gt;demanded&lt;/em&gt; by
the language used or by the examples in the New Testament. Rather, it should be
preferred as the &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; way of expressing visually the death, burial and
resurrection of the believer with Christ as well as the cleansing and
transformative elements of the practice. At the same time, those who practice
baptism by immersion should not reject baptisms by sprinkling or pouring as
false or unbiblical baptisms.&lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="subject"&gt;Subject&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The debate over the &lt;em&gt;subject&lt;/em&gt; of baptism is similarly heated. There are
essentially two positions on who should be baptized (with some variations in
each position): that only new believers should be baptized, or that new
believers and the children of believers should be baptized. While there are some
important differences regarding the &lt;em&gt;meaning&lt;/em&gt; of the baptism of believers, it is
the universal practice of all Christian churches. The baptism of infants or
as-yet-unbelieving children of newly converted parents, however, has been
attributed a wide number of meanings, ranging from cleansing from original sin
and the beginning of the individual&amp;rsquo;s own work of salvation (the Catholic view)
to entrance into the covenant community conditioned on personal faith (the
Presbyterian view).&lt;sup id="fnref:5"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, the vast majority of Christians throughout all history prior to
the 20th century baptized infants. On the other hand, the believer is
responsible finally to submit to the Bible, tradition notwithstanding; if the
Scriptures teaches credobaptism, even the weight of so much tradition must be
set aside. Nonetheless, church history is often illuminating for difficult
interpretive issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earliest unambiguous mention of infant baptism is Tertullian&amp;rsquo;s condemnation
of the practice in 198 A.D. Less than two decades later, though, Hippolytus
advocated the baptism of children incapable of answering for themselves less
than two decades later (parents or other relatives were to speak on behalf of
their children).&lt;sup id="fnref:6"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:6" rel="footnote"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Some argue that the commands for those baptized in earlier
documents such as the &lt;em&gt;Didache&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:7"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:7" rel="footnote"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; precludes children&amp;rsquo;s having been baptized,
but this is an argument from silence&amp;mdash;and these same kinds of commands appear
in the &amp;ldquo;Apostolic Tradition&amp;rdquo; following the instruction regarding children. In
any case, practice in the church was mixed by the end of the second century at
the latest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evidence from New Testament practice is also ambiguous.&lt;sup id="fnref:8"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:8" rel="footnote"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It is true that
in the cases where the recipients of baptism are clearly delineated, they are
believers. However, any argument regarding the household baptisms is necessarily
an argument from silence. There is no grounds in the text for asserting that
&lt;em&gt;none&lt;/em&gt; of the households that received baptism included infants or small
children incapable of professing faith.&lt;sup id="fnref:9"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:9" rel="footnote"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; To say otherwise is to read one&amp;rsquo;s
theological presuppositions into the text. By the same token, however,
paedobaptists have no more warrant than do credobaptists for claiming these
passages as clear evidence for their view. Believers may of course argue that
these passages should be interpreted in light of their understanding of the rest
of the New Testament&amp;mdash;but without the dogmatism too often present on both
sides. The passages simply do not say; indeed, no passage in the New Testament
even speaks clearly about believing children.&lt;sup id="fnref:10"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:10" rel="footnote"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the subject of baptism can be determined only through the passages that
teach about its meaning and function in the life of the believer. Covenantal
paedobaptists&lt;sup id="fnref:11"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:11" rel="footnote"&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; argue that, in continuity with the pattern of the Abrahamic
Covenant, children of believers&amp;mdash;that is, children of those who are themselves
members of the covenant community of faith&amp;mdash;should be baptized. They note,
rightly, that the major points of discontinuity marked off by the New Covenant
are with the &lt;em&gt;Mosaic&lt;/em&gt; covenant rather than the Abrahamic Covenant. As such, they
suggest that just as the (male) children of members of the Abrahamic covenant
were circumcised to symbolize their entrance into the covenant community, so
likewise (all) children of members of the New Covenant should be baptized. The
covenant view rightly distinguishes between the role of the symbol and the
necessary faith of the believer. It also rightly identifies the church with
Abraham&amp;rsquo;s offspring (cf. Luke 3:7&amp;ndash;9) and takes seriously the teaching in both
Testaments that Abraham and his offspring were saved by faith, not merely by
being members of the people of Israel (see esp. Gal. 3:1&amp;ndash;6).&lt;sup id="fnref:12"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:12" rel="footnote"&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, while the Abrahamic covenant led directly to the New Covenant, it
nonetheless had an ethnic or national bent to it that the New Covenant does not.
The Abrahamic covenant was with Abraham and his offspring in a specific nation,
though for the good of all nations (Gen. 12:1&amp;ndash;7, 15:1&amp;ndash;21, 17:1&amp;ndash;14).
Circumcision was established for Abraham and his descendants as their act of
covenant (Gen 17:9&amp;ndash;14). Yet the New Testament unambiguously does away with
circumcision as the mark of participation in God&amp;rsquo;s community (cf. Acts 10:1&amp;ndash;48,
16:3, 1 Cor. 7:18, Gal. 2:3, 5:2). The New Covenant circumcision is one &amp;ldquo;made
without hands&amp;rdquo; (Col. 2:11; cf. Deut. 30:6, Rom. 2:29) and is tied directly to
baptism&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;the circumcision of Christ&amp;rdquo; (Col. 2:11b&amp;ndash;12).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The covenant paedobaptist is right that baptism is to the church what
circumcision was to the Jews, but wrong about how entrance into the covenant
community now comes about.&lt;sup id="fnref:13"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:13" rel="footnote"&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Again: salvation was always by faith, but the
people of God are no longer constituted ethnically or nationally, but by faith
alone. To become one of God&amp;rsquo;s people in the Abrahamic covenant was to join the
nation of Israel; even when, as in Ruth&amp;rsquo;s case, that commitment was one of faith
it was also national and ethnic. It is no longer. Those who are to be baptized
are those who have become disciples (Matt. 28:18&amp;ndash;20), repented (Acts 2:38&amp;ndash;39),
been united with Christ in his death and resurrection (Rom. 6:3, Col 2:12), put
on Christ (Gal. 3:27), asked God for cleansing from sin (Acts 22:17) and for a
clear conscience (1 Pet. 3:21). In the New Covenant, &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; those who profess
faith are marked as belonging to the people of God.&lt;sup id="fnref:14"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:14" rel="footnote"&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In line with the practice described in the New Testament, then, only believers
should be baptized today: those who have made a clear and credible profession of
faith. However, those who affirm believer&amp;rsquo;s baptism should be careful not to
overstate their case. While the New Testament does incline this way, there is no
slam-dunk case, and no therefore warrant for sneering at those who disagree.
Moreover, other convictions held in light of one&amp;rsquo;s position on baptism must be
held moderately, in light of the provisional character of the doctrine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="excursus-rebaptism"&gt;Excursus: Rebaptism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rebaptism is a serious matter. It argues that the first baptism a person
underwent was not in fact a Christian baptism at all, for one should not
otherwise be rebaptized. There is only one instance of rebaptism recorded in the
New Testament: that of the believers in Ephesus (Acts 19), who had not been
baptized in the name of Jesus at all. If the meaning, mode, and subject of
baptism as outlined above are correct, then it is appropriate to rebaptize those
who have been baptized as unbelievers (including as children) or by those who
are not orthodox Christians (e.g. Mormons). However, it is inappropriate to
rebaptize those who were baptized by a mode other than immersion,&lt;sup id="fnref:15"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:15" rel="footnote"&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; for the
mode of baptism is neither a primary issue nor a point asserted dogmatically
anywhere in Scripture. Moreover, it is also inappropriate to rebaptize those who
were baptized as believers, but by churches holding differing views on the
meaning of baptism but which are nonetheless true Christian churches. Any
baptism applied to a believer on a valid profession of faith by a true church
ought to be respected by other Christian churches.&lt;sup id="fnref:16"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:16" rel="footnote"&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="baptismal-practice"&gt;Baptismal Practice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="baptism-and-the-lords-supper"&gt;Baptism and the Lord&amp;rsquo;s Supper&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many Baptists have argued that the Lord&amp;rsquo;s Supper should be reserved for those
who have been baptized as believers, by immersion&amp;mdash;a position that dates from
the origin of Baptist life (in the writings of William Kiffen) to the present
day (see the Baptist Faith and Message 2000 for just one example). A minority of
Baptists throughout the history of the movement (famously including John Bunyan)
have argued to the contrary: that the table ought to be open to any who have
given a valid profession of faith, or are members in good standing of other
Christian churches. Finally, a yet-smaller group has practiced local-church-only
communion, in which only the members of a given congregation may partake of
communion there. The first position, though most common, is perhaps least
sustainable in the author&amp;rsquo;s view. The fully open and local-church-only views are
more self-consistent in their interpretation of the relevant passages on the
Lord&amp;rsquo;s Supper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All those answering this question are attempting to deal rightly with the
reality that coming to the Table is a serious matter. The New Testament teaches
that Christians are not to partake of the meal with those who are in unrepentant
sin (1 Cor. 5) and warns that judgment will come on those who themselves partake
of the meal while unrepentant (1 Cor. 11:20&amp;ndash;30). Moreover, unrepentant sin is
the only boundary set around the table in the New Testament. But arguing that
being mistaken about even a practice so central as baptism constitutes
unrepentant sin is problematic. There are other doctrines of
denomination-forming importance, and which believers regard as sin issues; if
this logic were to be applied consistently, Christians could never share the
Table with anyone who did not share their every denominational distinctive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Mike Bergman comments, the Lord&amp;rsquo;s Table is for disciples&amp;mdash;for all those who
will be eating the supper together when the Lord returns.&lt;sup id="fnref:17"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:17" rel="footnote"&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The &amp;ldquo;closed&amp;rdquo;
communion position wrongly restricts the practice on the basis of a doctrinal
distinctive&amp;mdash;one having little to do with the meaning of the Table itself.
Baptism is important, but to be incorrect on a secondary (albeit important)
issue is not remotely as unrepentant sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advocates of closed communion sometimes argue for a modified version of this
position. Instead, they argue that participation in the Lord&amp;rsquo;s Supper requires
that one already have been baptized, and that since paedobaptism or baptism by a
mode other than immersion are by (their) definition not baptisms at all, such
believers should not be admitted to the table.&lt;sup id="fnref:18"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:18" rel="footnote"&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; However, this is also
problematic. First of all, it assumes facts not in evidence. The New Testament
makes no comment on the issue whatsoever, presumably because it was not an issue
(regardless of the question of credo- or paedobaptism), leaving one with no
direct exegetical warrant for drawing the line here. Moreover, the result is to
exclude from the table other believers whose faith in Christ one fully
acknowledges and who one is confident will share in the feast at the end of
ages&amp;mdash;on the basis of a debated interpretive issue, where the New Testament
draws no such line. Again, this reduces in no uncertain terms to the idea that
doctrinal differences are sufficient for excluding people from the Table, and
sets one rapidly on the path to sectarianism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, advocates of the local-church-only position rightly note that the local
church, and especially her shepherds, have a responsibility for the souls of
those who partake of the Table. Again, the New Testament is clear that partaking
of the talbe in known, unrepentant sin is a cause for judgment; it is likewise
clear that churches are as part of the practice of church discipline remove
unrepentant members from the table. Since the local church cannot ordinarily
know the spiritual condition of a visitor, it is safer to restrict communion
only to those about whom the congregation does have knowledge: members. However,
this position is similarly hard to sustain from the New Testament. While
churches are to remove from membership and access to the table those who are in
unrepentant sin, there is no indication of restricting the Table only to those
in the local congregation. Moreover, the text most often cited as evidence for
this position (1 Cor. 11:28) actually speaks to individuals holding themselves
accountable, rather than to churches holding their members accountable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that the New Testament pattern is indeed of baptism, the question once
again is whether the issue of baptism is so certain as to warrant this kind of
restriction. If, as argued above, there are grounds for holding a credobaptist
position only with considerable humility, Christians must likewise take care not
to draw too thick a line around other elements of the church&amp;rsquo;s practice on the
basis of baptismal doctrine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="baptism-and-the-local-church"&gt;Baptism and the Local Church&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the same arguments applied to the Lord&amp;rsquo;s Supper have been applied to the
issue of church membership, and many of the same concerns are in play. However,
many Baptist churches today practice open communion but closed membership, and a
number of high-profile Baptist leaders throughout history have advocated for
open membership as well as open communion.&lt;sup id="fnref:19"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:19" rel="footnote"&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Baptists have universally argued
for a regenerate church membership, and believer&amp;rsquo;s baptism by immersion has&lt;em&gt;usually&lt;/em&gt; been understood to be a prerequisite for membership, since other forms
of baptism have been deemed invalid.&lt;sup id="fnref:20"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:20" rel="footnote"&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Moreover, since a local church is not
merely a group of believers who happen to come together, but a group united
around common affirmations about the nature of the Christian life and the truths
Scripture teaches, local churches rightly have a higher bar for membership than
merely that a person appears truly to be saved.&lt;sup id="fnref:21"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:21" rel="footnote"&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Churches should certainly not admit to membership those who affirm their stance
on baptism yet continue to refuse it. In cases where the person affirms
paedobaptism, though, membership may not be wholly out of bounds&amp;mdash;for the same
reason that the Lord&amp;rsquo;s supper is not: the unity of the body of Christ matters
enormously. It will &lt;em&gt;usually&lt;/em&gt; be best in such circumstances to direct the
individual to another evangelical church in the area that practices
paedobaptism.&lt;sup id="fnref:22"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:22" rel="footnote"&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This best reflects the importance and seriousness of baptism.
However, there may be times when the best option is to admit such an individual
to membership&amp;mdash;e.g., in cases where the baptistic church is the evangelical
congregation in the area. Baptism is important, but not so important as to leave
a regenerate individual or family without fellowship. Until Christ returns and
finally sets all doctrines aright, people should gather with those with whom
they share core doctrinal affiliations where possible&amp;mdash;and be welcomed as
brothers and sisters in Christ where it is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; possible. Such a practice may,
by the grace of God, be used a little to knit together again the fractured body
of the church catholic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="is-baptism-a-church-ordinance"&gt;Is baptism a church ordinance?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some believers argue that baptism is specifically a church ordinance, and as
such that it should never (or only in very rare circumstances) be carried out
outside the church. Since baptism is the believer&amp;rsquo;s initiation into the church,
it is the right only of the church to carry it out.&lt;sup id="fnref:23"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:23" rel="footnote"&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; However, in nearly
every case in the New Testament, the newly baptized believers constituted the
first members of the church, and baptism is rarely mentioned outside of &amp;ldquo;church
planting&amp;rdquo; narratives. In the few cases where baptisms in the local church &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt;
discussed (1 Cor. 15:29), the content is simply not relevant. Indeed, Jesus
himself presided over (but did not participate in) a great many baptisms prior
to the formation of the local church, and evidently to a different end than
&amp;ldquo;Christian baptism&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;certainly the symbolism of death, burial, and resurrection
with Christ remained hidden from those recipients of baptism. As with John&amp;rsquo;s
baptism, this seems to have been a baptism &amp;ldquo;for repentance from sins&amp;rdquo; (Mark
1:4). Given the relative silence of Scripture on the subject, it again seems
best not to stake out too strong a position on who may and may not baptize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly the normal circumstance will be baptism in the context of a local
church, because the local church is the home of Christian ministry. However,
this is not a normative practice; should a person come to faith in the context
of a parachurch ministry, there is no basis for arguing that it is
&lt;em&gt;categorically&lt;/em&gt; wrong for the parachurch ministry to perform the convert&amp;rsquo;s
baptism. To be sure, a parachurch ministry that consistently baptizes new
converts may run the risk of usurping the church&amp;rsquo;s role&amp;mdash;but in this case, the
baptismal practice is a reflection of the problem, not itself the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-age-for-baptism"&gt;The Age for Baptism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the credo-baptist position that only those who have made a credible
profession of faith should be baptized, the question arises: how old must
someone be to offer a profession that the church deems credible and therefore
administers baptism? Put negatively, is there an age below which such a baptism
would be more akin to paedo- than to credobaptism? Or should any profession of
faith be accepted, regardless of the child&amp;rsquo;s age? There are a number of good
arguments in favor of baptizing even very young children after a clear
profession of faith.&lt;sup id="fnref:24"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:24" rel="footnote"&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; First, there is no evidence in Scripture for delaying
baptism after clear professions of faith: baptism normally followed a profession
of faith immediately.&lt;sup id="fnref:25"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:25" rel="footnote"&gt;25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Second, delaying baptism as a sort of &amp;ldquo;litmus test&amp;rdquo;
for baptism implies that something besides repentance and faith in Christ is
necessary for salvation. Third, it is not giving false assurance to affirm even
a child&amp;rsquo;s trust in Christ through the gospel&amp;mdash;perhaps even to the contrary
(Mark 10:13&amp;ndash;16). Moreover, the New Testament pattern for confirmation of
salvation is always a matter of encouraging those who &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; made a profession
to hold fast to it (cf. Heb. 2, 4, 6, 10), rather than discouraging people from
profession or baptism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there are also a number of reasons to consider delaying baptism for
children.&lt;sup id="fnref:26"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:26" rel="footnote"&gt;26&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; One caution against baptizing young adults who have made a
profession is the historic practice of baptistic churches, and that of many
baptistic churches outside the United States, where baptism has been and remains
a matter for adulthood. Another is the reality that young children, being easily
swayed by their parents or peers, might be inclined to make false professions of
faith&amp;mdash;even apparently sincere ones. Of course, &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; profession of faith may
be made for the wrong reasons.&lt;sup id="fnref:27"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:27" rel="footnote"&gt;27&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It is not the church&amp;rsquo;s job to prevent false
profession from being made, but to respond appropriately when a false profession
has been made (Matt. 18, 1 Cor. 5). Moreover, as noted above, Scripture is
simply silent on the age of non-adults baptized, so making a hard and fast rule
is unwarranted. It may nonetheless be wise to baptize only individuals who are
judged capable of making their own professions of faith&amp;mdash;perhaps those in their
early pre-teen years and onward, as judged together by parents and church
leaders in each case.&lt;sup id="fnref:28"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:28" rel="footnote"&gt;28&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baptism is the sign of the New Covenant, and should be applied to the members of
that covenant: believers. The preferred mode is immersion, but other modes may
be allowed if circumstances demand. Similarly, the church is the ordinary
context and her members the normal adminstrators of baptism, but it matters most
that a person be baptized by an orthodox Christian in the Trinitarian formula.
Those who have been baptized as believers ought not be rebaptized, regardless of
mode. Those who have not been baptized as believers may partake of the Lord&amp;rsquo;s
table, but should not ordinarly become members of a Baptist church. In all these
things, the people of God ought to rejoice in their participation in the death
and resurrection of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lord&amp;rsquo;s Supper belongs in a distinct category, insofar as it is a means
of &lt;em&gt;special&lt;/em&gt; grace in the Christian life, but it fits in this list as well.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contra Thomas White, &amp;ldquo;What Makes Baptism Valid?&amp;rdquo; in &lt;em&gt;Restoring Integrity

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See e.g. Luke 11:38, where it is clear the Pharisees were not surprised
that Jesus failed to take a whole-body bath; or Mark 7:4, where the same word is
used of washing after returning from the market; or Hebrews 6:2, 9:10, where it
refers to ritual purification&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:4"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the pattern of the early church, as evidenced by the very early
&amp;ldquo;Didache&amp;rdquo;, which argued for baptism by immersion if possible and by pouring if
necessary (&lt;em&gt;Didache&lt;/em&gt; 7).&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:4" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:5"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may be taken as a secondary argument against paedobaptism&amp;mdash;a point
made to the author and others by Nathan Finn in a number of personal
conversations and in several class lectures, 2013&amp;ndash;2015.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:5" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:8"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contra many Baptists, e.g. R. Stanton Norman, &lt;em&gt;The Baptist Way:

2005), 110&amp;ndash;112; White, 109&amp;ndash;110.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:8" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 8 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:10"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nearest the New Testament comes to it are: Jesus&amp;rsquo; welcome of little
children (Mark 10:13&amp;ndash;16), Paul&amp;rsquo;s admonitions to those married to unbelievers for
the sake of their spouse and children (1 Cor. 7:12&amp;ndash;16), and Paul&amp;rsquo;s instructions
to presumably believing children and their parents (Eph. 6:1&amp;ndash;4, Col. 3:20&amp;ndash;21) .&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:10" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 10 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:11"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For constraints of time and space, the author has left aside other views,
many of which are both historically and practically significant and deserves
serious interaction, but which have in the author&amp;rsquo;s view less Scriptural warrant
(to varying degrees) than the covenant position.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:11" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 11 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:12"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also perhaps surprising that in all the controversy stirred up by
the Judaizers in the early church, there is no mention of hostility over
children being excluded from the New Covenant&amp;mdash;a fairly striking change between
the two. This is especially so given that the distinction between Old and New
Covenants did not preclude the Judaizers from arguing for many &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; points of
even stronger continuity between Mosaic practice and that of the church&amp;mdash;still
less Abrahamic practice and that of the church. However, this is another
argument from silence and so cannot be taken as strong evidence one way or the
other. (Personal conversation with Doug Serven, August 5, 2010.)&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:12" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 12 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:14"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contested passages in Acts are left aside because, as has been noted,
they do not prove what either side claims they do. Lydia believed, and her
household was baptized&amp;mdash;does this mean her household had no infants in it and
everyone in it converted with her? It is impossible to say.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:14" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 14 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This, of course, partly begs the question, for it leaves aside the matter
of what constitutes a &amp;ldquo;true Christian church&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;certainly a contested issue,
and one beyond the scope of this paper. At a minimum, no group which rejects
orthodox Trinitarianism and Christology may be included. At most, some major
denominations may be excluded. The author is inclined to treat believers&amp;rsquo;
baptisms even by groups with serious doctrinal problems such as Roman
Catholics as valid, however, so long as the specific congregation by which
the believer was baptized rightly proclaimed a gospel of repentance from
sins and salvation through the finished work of Christ alone.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:16" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 16 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Close friendships between evangelical churches and their leaders would be

Schreiner and Shawn D. Wright (Nashville: B&amp;amp;H Academic, 2007), 329&amp;ndash;331;
White, 112&amp;ndash;114. Both merely &lt;em&gt;assert&lt;/em&gt; this point; neither demonstrates it.
Dever rightly grants that there is no biblical instruction about &lt;em&gt;who&lt;/em&gt;
should baptize (331) while failing to note that there is similarly no
express statement that it is a church ordinance.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:23" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 23 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Andy Davis is not just any author, and indeed not just any pastor. He is one of
&lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; pastors. This makes the task of writing a critical book review somewhat
strange. On the one hand, I wanted to write this review as I would any such. On
the other hand, I wanted to take care to show respect to a man whom God has used
to shepherd me and my family for the past two years since we moved to North
Carolina, and whom I regard very highly for his faithfulness in serving the
church gathered as First Baptist Church of Durham. I hope I have struck the
balance appropriately. And as I hope will become clear, though there were a few
places where this book could be stronger, it is nonetheless extraordinarily
valuable. I have been challenged and indeed have grown in holiness because of
having read it. I commend it to you.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An Infinite Journey: Growing toward Christlikeness&lt;/em&gt;, by Andrew M. Davis,
Greenville: Ambassador International, 2014, 480 pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="overview"&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Davis&amp;rsquo; &lt;em&gt;An Infinite Journey&lt;/em&gt; is a careful, thorough, heavy exploration of
the doctrine and practice of sanctification in the Christian life. Davis, the
long-time pastor of First Baptist Church in Durham, North Carolina and an
adjunct professor at nearby Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary, has
clearly dedicated considerable time and consideration to the topic of holiness
and growth in the Christian life, and this consideration is on display
throughout what is ultimately a very helpful book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Davis begins by introducing the concepts which permeate the rest of the book:
the saving work of God in Christ and the Christian&amp;rsquo;s lasting dependence on the
Holy Spirit. Perhaps surprisingly (at least to the casual reader), he opens not
with the topic of sanctification, but with justification, arguing that all real
Christian growth must be predicated on a right understanding of the gospel.
Thus, he spends some time tracing out the story of salvation, culminating in
Christ&amp;rsquo;s atoning death on the cross and resurrection, and his institution of the
church and sending the Holy Spirit to save and then shape the internal lives of
Christians throughout the ages. He further argues that all Christians are
involved in two &amp;ldquo;infinite journeys&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;the external journey of evangelism and
discipleship, and the internal journey of growth in holiness. Both, he notes,
are essential for the health of the Christian: to be deficient in either is to
demonstrate either ignorance or hard-heartedness toward the things of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this introduction, Davis turns to a map of the second of these journeys:
the internal path of growing Christ-likeness. His thesis is that sanctification
is a four-part process, involving a continuous sequence of knowledge, faith,
character, and action, each feeding into the next. Knowledge of God produces
faith; increasing faith produces Christlike character; a more Christlike
character results in more Godward actions; and those Godward actions in turn
lead to a greater knowledge of God himself. Davis dedicates a section of the
book to each of these ideas, examining in detail Scriptural support for the
concept and then examples of the element in the lives of figures in Scripture,
especially Christ. Finally, he turns to a section dedicated to application,
looking at the knowledge-faith-character-action cycle as a whole in both
Scripture and a variety of day-to-day scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="analysis"&gt;Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Davis&amp;rsquo; treatment of the doctrines of sanctification is thorough and compelling,
most of all because it is drenched in Scripture. Early in the book, Davis
explicitly spells out his commitment to the centrality, sufficiency, and
authority of Scripture, and the text of the book backs this up. It is common to
hear authors affirm the importance of Scripture; it is rare to see it so born
out so clearly in their writing. Even apart from the explicit references on
nearly every page, the text bears the unmistakable imprint of Davis&amp;rsquo; own
practice of memorizing books of the Bible. Allusions, near quotes, and implicit
references to Scripture appear multiple times on nearly every page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Scriptural emphasis leads to the book&amp;rsquo;s other great strengths. First, Davis
makes no point without basing the assertion on Scripture, and he draws on every
section of the Bible to demonstrate the importance of each aspect of his map for
growth in holiness. Moreover, he follows Scripture&amp;rsquo;s lead in grounding
sanctification in the work of Christ mediated to us by the Holy Spirit. Davis&amp;rsquo;
emphasis on the work of the Spirit is especially helpful. Though he is by no
means a charismatic in the modern sense of the word, it is clear that he is
gripped by the reality that sanctification simply does not happen without the
work of the Holy Spirit. This is an essential corrective for two kinds of
churches: those tempted to ignore the Spirit, and those tempted to ignore all
the works of the Spirit apart from those that result in visible signs. Rightly,
Davis&amp;rsquo; doctrine of sanctification is trinitarian: holy people whole-heartedly
worship the Father in Spirit-empowered dependence on the finished work of the
Son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, this Scriptural care allows Davis to navigate the difficult topic of
Spirit-dependent human effort that characterizes Biblical sanctification.
Because sanctification is the one aspect of salvation in which people are called
to work (e.g. in Phil. 2:12), many believers are tempted to treat sanctification
as a wholly human endeavor. Davis repudiates this notion, showing again and
again that sanctification&amp;mdash;like the justification that precedes it and the
glorification that will follow it&amp;mdash;is ultimately a work of God and one that
brings him all glory. No person will be able to claim the credit for their own
sanctification before God at the day of judgment. At the same time, he also
rejects a Keswickian spirituality (&amp;ldquo;let go and let God&amp;rdquo;), even when dressed up
as mere gospel dependence. However much in vogue the notion may be that we can
do nothing and God does everything for us, it is simply not true. God requires
us actively to seek him and his holiness. Davis rightly recognizes both these
dangers and charts a course between them. The pursuit of holiness is empowered
by the Holy Spirit, and believers must always fix their eyes on the finished
work of Christ and the promise of future glory. Yet believers keep their eyes on
Christ and rely on the Spirit &lt;em&gt;to work&lt;/em&gt;&amp;mdash;not to sit still and trust God to
float them toward holiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book does have a few weaknesses. First, although the book&amp;rsquo;s length and
thoroughness are valuable in many ways, they also make this a difficult sell for
anyone who is not already a dedicated reader. Moreover, while much of the length
was inevitable in a work this thorough on a topic this complex, the book could
be substantially shorter were it edited more carefully. Trimming the lengthy
introduction and removing some repetition, unnecessary explanations, and
clarifications would make the work stronger as well as shorter and more
approachable. Given Davis&amp;rsquo; goals&amp;mdash;to stir up believers to pursuing
holiness&amp;mdash;this would be profoundly helpful, as it would allow for the book to
be used in a broader variety of contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, a number of Davis&amp;rsquo; references to words&amp;rsquo; meanings in Greek are either
extraneous or inaccurate. In particular, he regularly committed the so-called
etymological fallacy, ascribing meaning to words based on their components
rather than their actual use in the language. (This led him several times to
disagree with every modern major translation!) He also sometimes referenced
English words derived from Greek terms, but in cases where the derivation is
irrelevant to the present meaning of the English word (e.g. &lt;em&gt;poem&lt;/em&gt; from
&lt;em&gt;poiema&lt;/em&gt;). Gladly, no major issues in the text hung on these cases. Nonetheless,
the misuses were distracting, and since in most cases they were also
unnecessary, they actually &lt;em&gt;weakened&lt;/em&gt; the book for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That these are the only significant issues in such a large and thorough book is
a significant achievement, and both could readily be addressed in future
editions of the work. Taken as a whole, Davis&amp;rsquo; book shines. As Davis points out,
holiness necessarily entails both knowledge of the things of God and zeal for
his glory. The book drips with Davis&amp;rsquo; passion for God and his urgent desire that
God&amp;rsquo;s people seek holiness, and it lays out a thoughtful and (most importantly)
Scriptural plan for how his people shall become holy. Lord willing, the volume
will be a reliable guide to sanctification for the church for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

The Centrality and Uniqueness of the Incarnation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Incarnation of the Son of God is the ground of all Christian hope. It is the
&amp;ldquo;central miracle asserted by Christians.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Without the Incarnation, there
would be no salvation. Not only would the other aspects of redemption (Christ&amp;rsquo;s
life, teaching, death on the cross, resurrection, and ascension) not be
possible, but parts of the restoration of humanity hinge on the Incarnation
itself. The Incarnation was a unique event in history, with unique theological
significance. At no other time has God manifested himself as a human being. The
Spirit&amp;rsquo;s present indwelling of all believers is a direct result of and carries
forward the reconciliation of divinity and humanity that occured in the person
of Jesus Christ. A healthy church depends on a healthy Christology, for it is
only in Christ and by Christ&amp;rsquo;s Spirit that the church exists&amp;mdash;and there can be
no healthy Christology without a robust doctrine of the Incarnation. It is in
the Incarnation that Jesus the Messiah must be understood: a single person
uniting all that it is to be God and all that it is to be human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="a-biblical-affirmations"&gt;A. Biblical Affirmations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of the Gospels opens in a way that emphasizes the unique nature of Jesus
Christ. Matthew begins with a genealogy that situates him in the story of
Israel, then immediately shows in narrative that from his conception he was also
divine (Matt. 1&amp;ndash;2, esp. 1:1, 1:23). Mark, ever brief, introduces the Messiah
with the astounding words, &amp;ldquo;Jesus Christ, the Son of God&amp;rdquo; (Mark 1:1).&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Luke
inverts Matthew&amp;rsquo;s order: miraculous birth first, genealogy second. He situations
Jesus not only in Israel&amp;rsquo;s story but in humanity&amp;rsquo;s, tracing his lineage to Adam
(Luke 1:26&amp;ndash;28, 2:8&amp;ndash;38, 3:23&amp;ndash;38). John reaches out to Greek philosophy and
turns it on its head, proclaiming the coming of the uncreated &lt;em&gt;logos&lt;/em&gt; into
creation (John 1:1&amp;ndash;18). The sum effect of the gospel-tellers is to emphasize
that in Jesus Christ, something profoundly unique had happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps nowhere are the importance and uniqueness of the Incarnation more
evident than in the Epistle to the Hebrews. The anonymous letter emphasizes from
its first words the uniqueness of Jesus&amp;rsquo; incarnation and ministry (Heb. 1:1&amp;ndash;2).
It argues that the Incarnation was essential to his roles as priest (2:17&amp;ndash;18,
4:15, 5:5&amp;ndash;10, 7:26&amp;ndash;8:2), destroyer of death (2:14&amp;ndash;15), and propitiatory
sacrifice (2:9, 7:27, 9:11&amp;ndash;28, 10:12&amp;ndash;14, 10:19&amp;ndash;22). It is not only that Jesus
died to save people from their sins, but that he became human and lived to that
end and more besides&amp;mdash;a consistent theme throughout the New Testament. Thus,
Zechariah&amp;rsquo;s prophecy (Luke 1:76&amp;ndash;79) includes salvation from sin, but also light
coming into the world, death&amp;rsquo;s power coming to an end, and peace reigning in the
cosmos. Likewise, John couples the Incarnation to the doctrine of adoption (John
1:12). Paul exults in the Incarnation as the grounds of the reconciliation of
all things, humanity included (Col 1:19&amp;ndash;20). Moreover, he explicitly couples
the Messiah&amp;rsquo;s full humanity to humans being filled in him in turn (Col.
2:9&amp;ndash;10)&amp;mdash;a theme Peter picks up as well, noting that the saints actually
become &amp;ldquo;partakers of the divine nature&amp;rdquo; (2 Peter 1:4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, the New Testament affirms that the Incarnation itself was an essential
element in the salvation of humanity&amp;mdash;not merely as a prerequisite for other
parts of Christ&amp;rsquo;s work. The Incarnation is the means by which human nature is
brought once again into fellowship with the Godhead. Christ is the
eschatological firstfruits of this restoration. As he is, so will all the saints
be in glory: restored to unbroken fellowship between humanity and humanity&amp;rsquo;s
Creator.&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="b-the-theology-of-the-church"&gt;B. The Theology of the Church&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The importance of the Incarnation has been affirmed by the church throughout her
history. The Church Fathers fleshed out the orthodox doctrine of the Incarnation
over the first four centuries of the history of the church, with various
controversies erupting every century.&lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This work culminated in the lasting
affirmations and denials of the Chalcedonian formula.&lt;sup id="fnref:5"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In fact, nearly every
theological controversy in the early church was a Christological controversy,
and every such controversy hinged on issues pertaining to the nature of the
Incarnation. The Fathers recognized that the details of God&amp;rsquo;s becoming man were
essentials of the faith. The hope of human salvation would be lost entirely if
Jesus were not a single person in whom &amp;ldquo;all the fullness of deity dwells bodily&amp;rdquo;
(Col. 2:9) and who &amp;ldquo;likewise partook of [flesh and blood]&amp;rdquo; (Heb. 2:14).&lt;sup id="fnref:6"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:6" rel="footnote"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incarnational thoelogizing did not end in the patristic period; it has remained
foundational for further reflection on the natures of God and humanity. Indeed,
patristic theology has been influential on nearly every major orthodox
theologian since the Reformation&amp;mdash;whether directly or mediated by the
Reformers. Athanasius&amp;rsquo; Christology, with its emphasis on the transformational
effect of the Incarnation itself on humanity&amp;rsquo;s state,&lt;sup id="fnref:7"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:7" rel="footnote"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; has proven
particularly influential. If advocates of &amp;ldquo;incarnational&amp;rdquo; theologies have
sometimes pressed this recovery in unhelpful directions (see below), they have
also provided a helpful reminder of what God&amp;rsquo;s becoming man has &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt;
accomplished: the first step of the eschatological transformation of humanity.
&amp;ldquo;The crucified Christ stands in solidarity with humanity, not merely as ane
xample of confrontation with the world to be imitated by us &lt;em&gt;but as the reality
of new humanity in which we may and must participate&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id="fnref:8"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:8" rel="footnote"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Jesus&amp;rsquo; humanity is
an essential ingredient in human salvation and in the sanctified life of the
believer in the present&amp;mdash;the Spirit mediating Christ&amp;rsquo;s humanity to the
believer&amp;rsquo;s&amp;mdash;as well as of a glorified reality in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ii-in-life-and-ministry"&gt;II. In Life and Ministry&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the importance&amp;mdash;indeed, the essential character&amp;mdash;of the doctrine of the
Incarnation, it is clear that the church must strive to maintain the doctrine.
It is insufficent only to affirm it in principle; the church must cherish this
reality in practice and protect it from loss. Unfortunately, both in the Western
church broadly and in evangelicalism in particular, the centrality and
uniqueness of the Incarnation have sometimes been lost through neglect or abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="a-absence"&gt;A. Absence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The church may first of all fail with regard to its theology of the Incarnation
by losing it, whether by doctrinal negation or by simple unobservance. The
threat of outright denial of the doctrine has been dangerously common in church
history. As noted above, many of the early Christological heresies relted
directly to the nature of the Incarnation, and variations on these heresies have
continued to arise to the present day. In the Reformation era, for example, the
Anabaptist movement included many who affirmed a &amp;ldquo;heavenly flesh&amp;rdquo; view in which
Jesus was not Mary&amp;rsquo;s descendant but sent from heaven without human parentage
whatsoever&amp;mdash;a loss of Christ&amp;rsquo;s full humanity. More recently, both Mormons and
Jehovah&amp;rsquo;s Witnesses have affirmed adoptionist views&amp;mdash;a loss of Christ&amp;rsquo;s full
deity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anti-supernatural bent of many liberal theologies in the last several
centuries has similarly resulted in a rejection of the doctrine of the
Incarnation. For many liberals theologians, Jesus was representative of the
God-consciousness in us all at its best and adopted by God as a special figure
in human history accordingly.&lt;sup id="fnref:9"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:9" rel="footnote"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Any such outright rejection clearly results in
the loss of all that the doctrine entails&amp;mdash;not least any hope of real
salvation. If Jesus was merely a man who was particularly helpful or holy, he
could not redeem other humans. He could at best set others a good example. His
death and his resurrection&lt;sup id="fnref:10"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:10" rel="footnote"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; can have symbolic power only. They do not save.
They inspire or impress at best, and intimidate with their inimitability at
worst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All such views leave those who embrace them without ultimate salvific hope. As
Gregory Nazianzen commented during the Arian controversy, &amp;ldquo;For that which He has
not assumed he has not healed; but that which is united to His Godhead is also
saved. If only half Adam fell, then that which Christ assumes and saves may be
half also; but if the whole of his nature fell, it must be united to the whole
nature of Him that was begotten, and so be saved as a whole.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id="fnref:11"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:11" rel="footnote"&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though no conservative scholars would actively deny the importance of the
Incarnation, their passive neeglect can be nearly as problematic. Sadly, the
doctrine receives receives little attention among evangelicals. The crucicentric
bent of the evangelical movement has often led to other aspects of the Son&amp;rsquo;s
work being overlooked, so that the Incarnation, Resurrection, and Ascension of
Christ are all often treated as mere prerequisites for or accessories to his
atoning death.&lt;sup id="fnref:12"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:12" rel="footnote"&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Even when unintentional, this loss-by-neglect results in
real problems in the church&amp;rsquo;s understanding of God&amp;rsquo;s work in Christ and
humanity. Many of the borderline gnostic tendencies latent in evangelical
theology eschatology, and the corresponding spiritualization and
de-physicalization of evangelical eschatology, must be laid at least in part at
the feet of a deficient theology of the Incarnation. This can only lead to a
dimming of future hope&amp;mdash;who really wants to be a disembodied spirit somehow
strumming a harp forever?&amp;mdash;which in turn produces real challenges in the life
and faith of believers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="b-incarnational-theology-a-two-fold-error"&gt;B. &amp;ldquo;Incarnational Theology&amp;rdquo;: A Two-Fold Error&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The church may also err by misapplying its theology of the Incarnation. It has
become increasingly common to speak of &amp;ldquo;incarnational theology&amp;rdquo; as a way of
describing the Christian mission to the world: Christians ought to &amp;ldquo;incarnate&amp;rdquo;
Christ to the world as Christ &amp;ldquo;incarnated&amp;rdquo; the Godhead to humanity.&lt;sup id="fnref:13"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:13" rel="footnote"&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; There
is much to appreciate in this sentiment. It represents an appropriate
recognition that humans are God&amp;rsquo;s image-bearers. It pays heed to the New
Testament&amp;rsquo;s assertion that Christians are representatives of Christ. It takes
seriously Paul&amp;rsquo;s shocking language of &amp;ldquo;filling up what is lacking in Christ&amp;rsquo;s
afflictions&amp;rdquo; (Col. 1:24). It rightly points to the synthesis of missionary
activity and social activism that represents the best of evangelicalism.&lt;sup id="fnref:14"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:14" rel="footnote"&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
Yet for all that, applying the language of incarnation to believers is a serious
mistake in two ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, this kind of &amp;ldquo;incarnational&amp;rdquo; language is a misapplication of Paul&amp;rsquo;s
&amp;ldquo;body&amp;rdquo; metaphor for the church, contra the proponents of &amp;ldquo;incarnational
theology&amp;rdquo;, and notwithstanding Scripture&amp;rsquo;s many calls to imitate Christ.&lt;sup id="fnref:15"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:15" rel="footnote"&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
Paul uniformly used the language to teach the unity of the people of God&amp;mdash;never
evangelism. The authors of the New Testament chose other images for proclaiming
Christ instead: fishermen (Matt. 4:19), harvest workers (Luke 10:2), servants
working in the absence of their master (Matt. 24:45&amp;ndash;51), or ambassadors and
representatives (2 Cor. 5:20)&amp;mdash;to name just a few. At no point, though, does
the Bible use the metaphor of the body to describe Christian witness to the
world. Nor does it support the idea that ordinary men and women can mediate the
presence of God to people. The Incarnation may (and indeed should) prompt
evangelism, but this response is not itself &amp;ldquo;incarnational.&amp;rdquo; The people of God
do not incarnate God the Son, but represent him in other ways. That does not
negate the helpful instincts expressed in the incarnational theologizing of the
last few years. It simply means that this doctrine can be expressed more
accurately and helpfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the church loses a great deal when incarnational theology is about
anyone other than Jesus. God becoming man was an astounding and singular event.
As Lewis commented, &amp;ldquo;It was the central event in the history of the Earth&amp;mdash;the
very thing that the whole story has been about.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id="fnref:16"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:16" rel="footnote"&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; When theologians speak of
&amp;ldquo;incarnating&amp;rdquo; Christ, the sheer shock of the event fades. The focus shifts from
the Son&amp;rsquo;s work in humanity to the human response to the Son. The doctrine of the
Incarnation above all ought to lead to worship born of reflection not on human
endeavors, but on divine intervention to undo human brokenness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="iii-conclusion"&gt;III. Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both the centrality of the Incarnation and its uniqueness are essential to
healthy Christian theology. A robust doctrine of the Incarnation leads to
greater worship and deeper future hope. Understood rightly, it leads to deeper
faith in the Word who &amp;ldquo;became flesh and dwelt among us&amp;rdquo; (John 1:14), and so to
more faithful obedience to the gospel. The believer seeks peace and justice and
above all that others may know Christ not because the he himself incarnates
Christ, but because the Incarnation has produced a radical transformation in his
life (and in the lives of all who believe). &amp;ldquo;Christ gives his sanctified
humanity to us, so that we may partake of him and his goodness.... God assumed
our umanity in Jesus of Nazareth, healed our humanity with his own being, and
gave our sanctified humanity back to us.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id="fnref:17"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:17" rel="footnote"&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The church must therefore take
care to protect the doctrine, both from reject or loss through neglect and from
misappropriations of the language of incarnation that distract from the work of
the Son. The Incarnation itself is essential and central in God&amp;rsquo;s work in the
life of believers. It must never be obscured, diminished, or denied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="appendix-the-chalcedonian-definition"&gt;Appendix: The Chalcedonian Definition&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:18"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:18" rel="footnote"&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;For the synod is opposed to those who presume to rend asunder the mystery
of the Incarnation into a double Sonship, and it deposes from the priesthood
those who dare to say that the Godhead of the Only-begotten is passible; and it
withstands those who imagine a mixing or confusion of the two natures of Christ;
and it drives away those who erroneously teach that the form of a servant which
he took from us was of a heavenly or some other substance; and it anathematizes
those who feign that the Lord had two natures before the union, but that these
were fashioned into one after the union.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wherefore, following the holy Fathers, we all with one voice confess our Lord
Jesus Christ one and the same Son, the same perfect in Godhead, the same perfect
in manhood, truly God and truly man, the same consisting of a reasonable soul
and a body, of one substance with the Father as touching the Godhead, the same
of one substance with us as touching the manhood, like us in all things apart
from sin; begotten of the Father before the ages as touching the Godhead, the
same in the last days, for us and for our salvation, born from the Virgin Mary,
the Theotokos, as touching the manhood, one and the same Christ, Son, Lord,
Only-begotten, to be acknowledged in two natures, without confusion, without
change, without division, without separation; the distinction of natures being
in no way abolished because of the union, but rather the characteristic property
of each nature being preserved, and concurring into one Person and one
subsistence (ὑπόστασις), not as if Christ were parted or divided into two
persons, but one and the same Son and only-begotten God, Word, Lord, Jesus
Christ; even as the Prophets from the beginning spoke concerning him, and our
Lord Jesus Christ instructed us, and the Creed of the Fathers has handed down to
us.&lt;/p&gt;
