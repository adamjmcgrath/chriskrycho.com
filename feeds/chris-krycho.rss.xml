As with the other posts in this series, these are off-the-cuff impressions, which may be inaccurate in various ways. I’d be happy to hear feedback! Note, too, that my preferences are just that: preferences. Your tastes may differ from mine. &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/rust-and-swift.html"&gt;(See all parts in the series.)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next chapter in the Swift book focuses on &lt;em&gt;inheritance&lt;/em&gt;, a concept which does not yet exist in Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swift embraces classical inheritance for &lt;code&gt;class&lt;/code&gt; data types. As noted &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2015/rust-and-swift-x.html"&gt;previously&lt;/a&gt;, Rust’s &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt; covers much of the ground covered by Swift’s &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;class&lt;/code&gt; types together (value and reference types, etc.). However, what Swift’s &lt;code&gt;class&lt;/code&gt; types bring to the table is inheritance-based (and not just composition-based) extension of types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a bit of an interesting point: it is an area where, &lt;em&gt;as of today&lt;/em&gt;, Swift can do something that is flat impossible in Rust—a rarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the &lt;em&gt;status quo&lt;/em&gt; will be changing sometime in the next year or so, as there is a &lt;a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1210"&gt;Rust RFC&lt;/a&gt; which has been accepted and is in the process of being implemented which paves the way for inheritance. (Discussions are &lt;a href="https://aturon.github.io/blog/2015/09/18/reuse/"&gt;ongoing&lt;/a&gt; as to the best way to implement it for Rust. Classical inheritance with vtables as in Swift is probably &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; going to be the approach.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason Rust’s core team chose to proceed without inheritance for the 1.0 release of the language last May is simple: at a philosophical level, they prefer (as in general most developers increasingly acknowledge that we should all prefer) composition over inheritance. &lt;em&gt;Prefer&lt;/em&gt;, not &lt;em&gt;universally choose&lt;/em&gt;, because there are situations in which inheritance is the correct choice. But there is a reason that programming with interfaces rather than via sub-classing is a “best practice” for many scenarios in languages like Java or C#.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rust’s &lt;code&gt;trait&lt;/code&gt; system gives you &lt;em&gt;composition&lt;/em&gt; in some remarkably powerful ways, allowing out to do things that in C++, for example, have to be accomplished via a combination of inheritance and overloading. Swift, likewise, supplies a &lt;code&gt;protocol&lt;/code&gt; system and allows extensions to define further behavior on top of existing data structures. From what I’ve gathered, those approaches are preferred over inheritance in Swift for the same reason Rust shipped 1.0 without it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Swift does have inheritance, so it’s worth seeing how it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, any &lt;code&gt;class&lt;/code&gt; which doesn’t declare a parent from which to inherit is a base class. This is an important difference from, say, Python, where all classes inherit from &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt; (leaving aside custom metaclasses).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The syntax choices Swift has made around sub-class declarations are sensible and readable: &lt;code&gt;class SubClass: ParentClass&lt;/code&gt; is eminently readable and doesn’t have any obvious points of overlap with other elements in the language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; of the choices made around classes are quite sensible. Overrides, for example, are made explicit via the &lt;code&gt;override&lt;/code&gt; keyword. While I’ve sometimes poked fun at Swift’s tendency to add keywords everywhere, this seems like a reasonable place to have one, and it’s nice that overrides are explicit rather than implicit. The same is true of the use of &lt;code&gt;super&lt;/code&gt; to refer to the superclass. I’m not sure of the implementation details, but &lt;code&gt;super&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em&gt;appears&lt;/em&gt; to act as just a special/reserved name for an object: all the syntax around it is normal object instance syntax, which is as it should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The limitations around overriding properties all make sense. You can override a read- or write-only parent property as both readable and writable, but you can’t override a readable or writable property &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to be readable or writable respectively. Presumably this is because the method lookup for properties always checks up the inheritance chain for getters or setters, so if one is present, you can’t just get rid of it. (You could of course override with a no-op function that spews a warning or some such, but that would pretty clearly be an abuse of the parent API. There might be times you would do that with a third-party library parent class, but in your own code it should be avoided: it indicates a problem in your API design that you need to address instead.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we have Swift’s &lt;code&gt;final&lt;/code&gt; keyword—and yes, pun intended. It marks whatever block-level item it is attached to—whether class, method, or property—as non-overridable. Attempts to override an item marked final are compile-time failures. (The same kind of thing exists in Java and C#.) In and of itself, this isn’t especially interesting. It is interesting to ponder whether you should make classes subclass-able or not in your API design. There has been &lt;a href="http://mjtsai.com/blog/2015/12/21/swift-proposal-for-default-final/"&gt;an active debate&lt;/a&gt;, in fact, nether classes in Swift should become final &lt;em&gt;by default&lt;/em&gt; in Swift 3.0, rather than open by default. The debate centers on the danger of unintended consequences of overriding, which ultimately takes us back around to the preference for composition, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this, among other things, raises the very interesting question of what this will look like in Rust when, eventually, we get inheritance there. After all, we know it will be quite different in some ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It presumably won’t involve a distinct data type constructor, &lt;em&gt;a la&lt;/em&gt; Swift’s distinction between &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;class&lt;/code&gt;: there may be syntactic sugar involved, and there will definitely be new functionality present, but it will certainly be built on the existing language features as well. There’s a good chance it will basically &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt; like just a special case of &lt;code&gt;impl SomeTrait for SomeStruct&lt;/code&gt;, which would fit very well with the ways Rust solves so many othe problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rust doesn’t have many of the things which Swift takes care to special-case for overriding with &lt;code&gt;final&lt;/code&gt;, but it will need to address that case for inherited methods and data in some way. (The proposal linked above uses a distinction between &lt;code&gt;default&lt;/code&gt; and blanket implementations for trait specialization to pull this off; if those words don’t mean anything to you, don’t worry: I’ve read that post and RFC half a dozen times before I got a really solid handle on all the pieces involved.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will be a relative latecomer to the language, rather than baked in from the start, and therefore will likely seem a secondary way of solving problems, especially at first. (This is, I think, both intentional and good.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

As with the other posts in this series, these are off-the-cuff impressions, which may be inaccurate in various ways. I’d be happy to hear feedback! Note, too, that my preferences are just that: preferences. Your tastes may differ from mine. &lt;a href="/rust-and-swift.html"&gt;(See all parts in the series.)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rust and Swift both support defining subscript access to a given data type, like &lt;code&gt;SomeType[accessedByIndex]&lt;/code&gt;. Unsurprisingly, given &lt;a href="/rust-and-swift.html"&gt;everything we’ve seen so far&lt;/a&gt;, Rust does this with traits, and Swift with a keyword.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Rust, you can define subscript-style access to a type by implementing the &lt;code&gt;Index&lt;/code&gt; and/or &lt;code&gt;IndexMut&lt;/code&gt; traits, which allow &lt;em&gt;indexing&lt;/em&gt; into a given location in a kind of type. The implementation simply requires one function, which is called when you use the &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt; operator. That function, &lt;code&gt;index&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;index_mut&lt;/code&gt;, implements how to do the lookup for the specific type. The &lt;code&gt;impl&lt;/code&gt; block indicates not only that &lt;code&gt;Index&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;IndexMut&lt;/code&gt; is being implemented, but also the type of the &lt;em&gt;key&lt;/em&gt; used: &lt;code&gt;impl Index&amp;lt;Bar&amp;gt; for Foo { ... }&lt;/code&gt;, where access would look like &lt;code&gt;a_foo[some_bar]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two kinds of traits and corresponding methods define the behavior for immutable and mutable data type, as their name suggest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the trait is defined generically, you can implement whatever kinds of accessors you like to the same underlying data structure, including generics accessors with trait bounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is perhaps telling that in Rust you just find these traits in the general &lt;code&gt;std::ops&lt;/code&gt; module, where all the core language operations and associated operators are defined. Rust doesn’t do “operator overloading” so much as it simply provides operators as one more class of trait potentially applicable to your type. (The family resemblance to Haskell’s type classes and similar in other languages is obvious.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Swift, you define indexing behavior with the &lt;code&gt;subscript&lt;/code&gt; keyword. Subscripts act very salary to Swift’s &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2016/rust-and-swift-xii.html"&gt;computed properties&lt;/a&gt;. They can be made read- or write-only by including or excluding &lt;code&gt;get&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt; function definitions, just like computed properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The behavior is in fact so closely aligned with the computed property syntax and behavior that I initially wondered if it wasn’t just a special case. It is not (though I’m sure much of the parsing machinery can be shared). As the designation of &lt;code&gt;subscript&lt;/code&gt; as a keyword strongly implies, and unlike in Rust, this is a separate language construct, not building on existing language machinery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swift , like Rust, allows you to define arbitrary accessors. However, since the behavior relies on the &lt;code&gt;subscript&lt;/code&gt; construct rather than generics and protocols (Swift’s equivalent to Rust’s traits), you define different kinds of accessors via multiple &lt;code&gt;subscript&lt;/code&gt; blocks. (Presumably these could take generic arguments, but I haven’t tested that to be sure.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both languages proceed to use these as ways of accessing types as makes sense—e.g. for not only arrays or vectors, but also dictionaries in Swift and &lt;code&gt;HashMap&lt;/code&gt; types in Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since you can define the behavior yourself, you can also use complex types as keys. The languages approach this a bit differently, though. In Rust, if you wanted a compound key, you would need to define either a simple container &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt; or use a tuple as the argument. In Swift, because it uses the same basic syntax as computed properties, you can just define as many method arguments, of whatever type, as you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Takeaway: Rust uses traits; Swift uses a keyword. We probably could have guessed that when we started, at this point!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please open your Bibles to Judges, chapter 3. And as you turn there, I want you to think about these words:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boring exegesis &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be wrong when the texts are so obviously full of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boring exegesis &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be wrong when the texts are so obviously full of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s N. T. Wright, speaking of the Pauline epistles. But I think, equally applicable whenever we come to God’s word—especially in preaching and teaching—and most especially when the texts are like this one: lively, to say the least; strange, even.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have two goals for this sermon. The first—always the first—is to show the grace of God clearly. As Bryan Chappell, the author &lt;em&gt;Christ-Centered Preaching&lt;/em&gt;, puts it, we want to see how God did for his people then what they could not do for themselves; and through that to be be reminded of what he has done for us, that we could not do for ourselves. That’s the point of this sermon: God’s grace in Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But secondarily—thinking about boring exegesis; thinking about hard texts like Judges 3—I hope to encourage you that these texts, these strange texts, these sometimes difficult texts—they’re for us, and for our good. They’re for our people, and our people’s good. We don’t need to ashamed of them, or embarrassed by them, or intimidated by them. Rather, we can come away seeing how these texts magnify the grace of God, how these texts remind us to look to Christ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Body&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;section id="othniel-the-first-judge" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Othniel: The first judge&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let’s look and see. This is a long passage, with three judges—Othniel, Ehud, and Shamgar—so we’ll take each in turn. Read with me, starting in verse 7:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the people of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the LORD. They forgot the LORD their God and served the Baals and the Asheroth. Therefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Cushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia. And the people of Israel served Cushan-rishathaim eight years. But when the people of Israel cried out to the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer for the people of Israel, who saved them, Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother. The Spirit of the LORD was upon him, and he judged Israel. He went out to war, and the LORD gave Cushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand. And his hand prevailed over Cushan-rishathaim. So the land had rest forty years. Then Othniel the son of Kenaz died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This first narrative is probably the easiest to understand. &lt;strong&gt;Othniel&lt;/strong&gt; is &lt;strong&gt;the first judge&lt;/strong&gt;. He is the prototype for all the other judges that follow. His story shows out the pattern for the whole book, the same one the author laid out back in chapter 2: sin, discipline, a cry for mercy, and God’s deliverance through a judge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verse 7: Israel sins. They &lt;em&gt;forgot&lt;/em&gt; Yahweh their God. They served the Ba’als and the Asheroth instead of the God who had delivered them from Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s an interesting word choice: &lt;em&gt;forgot&lt;/em&gt;—and it’s an important word, not only in this passage, but throughout the Bible. After all the reminders in the covenant: Set up these stones so you remember! Teach your children, so they remember. Bind it on your hands and your forehead, so you remember! And they forgot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Othniel is Caleb’s brother, note. They forgot in the &lt;em&gt;first generation&lt;/em&gt; they were in the land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we forget, we get things wrong. You’ve seen it happen: a spouse forgets an anniversary, and spends some time “in the dog house.” Or parents who miss a school event for their children, and leave them feeling like they don’t matter. Forgetting a friend’s birthday: maybe you’re not as close as you thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And sometimes… we all forget who God is, what he has done for us, and what our relationship to him is as the covenant people of God. We find ourselves fixated on the approval of the people in the pews, on the applause of subscribers to our popular podcast, on the affirmation of our professional peers. We become idolaters—just like Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he showed them mercy. How? “He sold them into the hand of Cushan-rishathaim, king of Mesopotamia”—not mercy the way we might be inclined to think of it, but real, deep mercy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because: see what happens? It had the intended effect. They remembered Yahweh and called out to him. And he delivered them—both from the pagan King, and from their idolatry, at least for a time! The Spirit came on Othniel, and he led Israel to war, and God delivered them from Cushan-rishathaim, and they had peace for forty years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God delivered his people, and Othniel, this &lt;em&gt;first judge&lt;/em&gt;, was a good judge. He wasn’t a prophet like Moses; he didn’t give them lasting rest, any more than Joshua had (40 years is good, but it’s not &lt;em&gt;forever&lt;/em&gt;); and he didn’t circumcise their hearts. Not &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; judge then. A good judge, but not &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; judge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="ehud-the-assassin" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ehud: The assassin&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, he was also the &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; of the Judges. Things only go downhill from here. Who’s next? &lt;strong&gt;Ehud: the assassin.&lt;/strong&gt; Let’s read again, picking up in verse 12:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the people of Israel again did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done what was evil in the sight of the LORD. He gathered to himself the Ammonites and the Amalekites, and went and defeated Israel. And they took possession of the city of palms. And the people of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the people of Israel cried out to the LORD, and the LORD raised up for them a deliverer, Ehud, the son of Gera, the Benjaminite, a left-handed man. The people of Israel sent tribute by him to Eglon the king of Moab. And Ehud made for himself a sword with two edges, a cubit in length, and he bound it on his right thigh under his clothes. And he presented the tribute to Eglon king of Moab. Now Eglon was a very fat man. And when Ehud had finished presenting the tribute, he sent away the people who carried the tribute. But he himself turned back at the idols near Gilgal and said, “I have a secret message for you, O king.” And he commanded, “Silence.” And all his attendants went out from his presence. And Ehud came to him as he was sitting alone in his cool roof chamber. And Ehud said, “I have a message from God for you.” And he arose from his seat. And Ehud reached with his left hand, took the sword from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly. And the hilt also went in after the blade, and the fat closed over the blade, for he did not pull the sword out of his belly; and the dung came out. Then Ehud went out into the porch and closed the doors of the roof chamber behind him and locked them. When he had gone, the servants came, and when they saw that the doors of the roof chamber were locked, they thought, “Surely he is relieving himself in the closet of the cool chamber.” And they waited till they were embarrassed. But when he still did not open the doors of the roof chamber, they took the key and opened them, and there lay their lord dead on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ehud escaped while they delayed, and he passed beyond the idols and escaped to Seirah. When he arrived, he sounded the trumpet in the hill country of Ephraim. Then the people of Israel went down with him from the hill country, and he was their leader. And he said to them, “Follow after me, for the LORD has given your enemies the Moabites into your hand.” So they went down after him and seized the fords of the Jordan against the Moabites and did not allow anyone to pass over. And they killed at that time about 10,000 of the Moabites, all strong, able-bodied men; not a man escaped. So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest for eighty years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see the same pattern again here… sort of. We see Israel sin, and God discipline them. And we see Israel cry out to their covenant God, and we see him deliver them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But of course, Ehud’s story is more complicated than Othniel’s was. Some of the details here might initially perplex us. Why do we hear about how fat the king is? Why do we hear about the dung coming out after he gets stabbed? Why almost any of the extraneous-seeming details in this story?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, this is satire. (Which doesn’t make it untrue, of course.) The author plays up the ridiculous elements in this bit of history to make a point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do we see here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A conquering king! …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;who’s actually morbidly obese, not exactly a strapping warrior&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;who, so cunning he could forge an alliance with the Ammonites and Amalekites, gets fooled by a simple trick (“Oh king, I have secret message for you”)—he’s either hopelessly naive or profoundly overconfident; neither is good&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a man who so comically out of line with what a king should be that his servants don’t even notice when there’s a wretched stench and he takes a &lt;em&gt;looong&lt;/em&gt; time relieving himself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great king.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And his servants? They aren’t exactly top-drawer. They don’t even notice Ehud escaping after he assassinated their king…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we read the story right, it’s humorous. The author is poking fun at the Moabites! “Those Moabites!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, wait… those Moabites conquered Israel. This ridiculous Moabite king?… Ehud was there to bring him tribute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Israel&lt;/em&gt; is the real joke. The idolaters who got conquered by &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; king. Ouch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what good satire does. It sneaks in, makes you laugh, and then hits you where it counts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what about Ehud himself? What about this savior figure? He’s not good either. He’s a vicious assassin, a traitor who stabbed the man he was legally supposed to be serving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This story is messy. Not just because of the dung coming out. But because while yes, God did deliver his people, and that is good—but Ehud isn’t the kind of deliverer we want, not the kind of deliverer we need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not the brutal killer, but the one who was brutally killed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not the one who defeated a foreign king by stabbing him in the gut, but the one who overcame both the pagan oppressor and the idolatry that led to that oppression by &lt;em&gt;being&lt;/em&gt; stabbed, by taking the weapon to &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; gut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book of Judges shows us over and over again what we’re like left to our own purposes. How even our human saviors are woefully insufficient. The covenant hope, proclaimed from the start of Genesis and made so clear in Deuteronomy… was still waiting to be fulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="shamgar-unifying-theme" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Shamgar &amp;amp; Unifying Theme&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then we come to the end of this chapter—to &lt;strong&gt;Shamgar: the man with an ox-goad&lt;/strong&gt; and his one verse: verse 31.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After him was Shamgar the son of Anath, who killed 600 of the Philistines with an oxgoad, and he also saved Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you’re like me, you’re wondering at least two things about this passage. One is: what in the world is an oxgoad? That’s the easy one: It’s a cattle prod. A long wooden pole with a point on the end. Makes for a decent improvised spear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the other question, the bigger question, is &lt;em&gt;why does Ehud get paragraphs, with lurid details for a satire… and Shamgar gets just one sentence?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a man who, based on his name, doesn’t even seem to be an Israelity, who shows up, kills 600 Philistines with an ox-goad, and then he’s gone. He gets one mention in Deborah’s song in chapter 5, but basically, this is it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why mention him at all if he’s so seemingly unimportant? Why these proportions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, this is the inspired word of God. And the author had a reason for giving us these stories, even &lt;em&gt;these proportions.&lt;/em&gt; He’s making a point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We read this and I, for one, think, “Oh, that sounds interesting; how did he do that with a cattle pr—” “NO. That’s not the question.” He slams the door on that question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shamgar’s skill with an ox-goad is not the point, any more than Ehud’s skill as an assassin was the point, any more even than Othniel’s skill as a military leadership was the point. No more, I put it to you, than any of &lt;em&gt;us&lt;/em&gt; are the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And he also saved Israel.” Those words tell us what we need to know. Who saved Israel? Shamgar… Ehud… Othniel… but really, in every case, Yahweh. The covenant-keeping God, who saved Israel not only from 600 Philistines, not only from a Moabite king worthy of derision, not only from a mighty king of Mesopotamia—but from her idolatry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="summary-and-exhortation" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary and Exhortation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someday—someday, after many judges, many kings, many priests, many prophets—there would come a deliverer—a judge, a prophet, a priest, a king—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;who would give the land rest, who would give the people of God true rest, for more than just a generation; forever…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;who would be a wise king&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;who would be gentle and gracious ruler&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;who would give God’s people circumcised hearts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;who would fulfill the covenant hopes and take on himself the covenant curses of Deuteronony, of Exodus, of Genesis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have that deliverer. We have Christ. “And he also saved Israel.” So when we read, when we teach, when we preach, let us look, every time, and see what God did for his people that they could not do for themselves. Let us, in every passage, in every picture of grace, find a reminder of what God has done for us in Christ, that we could not do for ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a deliverer. Don’t forget. Don’t let your people forget. We have a deliverer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gracious Father: thank you for delivering us. Help us be faithful with your word. Help us remember, and help us remind your people, of how you have delivered us. In the name of Jesus, our savior, amen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Alas, I ran out of time in preparation and didn’t get to cover everything I wanted—I would have liked very much to cover modules, and to cover fat-arrow-functions in more depth than I did. I’ll look forward to hopefully giving further tech talks at Olo in the future, and perhaps giving this one, expanded and finished out a bit, elsewhere. (If you’d like me to give a talk, including this one, just let me know!)

It works well for me, and I think it’s worth documenting for other nerdy types out there, but if you’re just getting going with podcasting and you’re looking for the easy way to do it, let me warn you: &lt;em&gt;this isn’t it&lt;/em&gt;. Something like &lt;a href="https://soundcloud.com/for/podcasting"&gt;SoundCloud&lt;/a&gt; and a blog for show notes, or &lt;a href="https://wordpress.org"&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/powerpress/"&gt;Blubrry PowerPress&lt;/a&gt; is what you want instead. This approach works &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; well for statically-generated sites, however, and I imagine a few people out there might find it useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="the-short-version" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The short version&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generate the feeds with &lt;a href="http://reinventedsoftware.com/feeder/"&gt;Feeder&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generate the site statically with something else (and it &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t matter what).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy the feed into the generated site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="the-long-version" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The long version&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I generate the sites themselves with &lt;a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.6.3/"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.newrustacean.com/show_notes/e001/index.html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;cargo doc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, respectively. I was already comfortable with Pelican because it’s what I use to generate &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; site (with a few &lt;a href="https://github.com/chriskrycho/chriskrycho.com/blob/master/pelicanconf.py"&gt;tweaks&lt;/a&gt; to the standard configuration, especially using &lt;a href="http://pandoc.org/"&gt;Pandoc&lt;/a&gt; rather than the Python Markdown implementation), so I ran with it for building the Winning Slowly site, and it has worked quite well for building the site itself. It just gets built locally and deployed via &lt;a href="https://pages.github.com/"&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it does not have built-in support for generating &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS_enclosure"&gt;podcast feeds&lt;/a&gt;, even just the general case with enclosures. &lt;a href="https://itunespartner.apple.com/en/podcasts/overview"&gt;iTunes podcast support&lt;/a&gt; would have taken a lot of work to add.&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Instead, I chose to build the RSS feed semi-manually. &lt;em&gt;Semi&lt;/em&gt;-manually, because doing it totally manually is a recipe for making mistakes. XML is many things, but “easy to write correctly by hand” is not one of them. I use &lt;a href="http://reinventedsoftware.com/feeder/"&gt;Feeder&lt;/a&gt; to manage the feeds, and &lt;em&gt;it&lt;/em&gt; makes sure that the enclosure and iTunes elements are set correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest upside to this is that I can use Pelican without modification to how it generates feeds (apart from optionally turning them off entirely). It just &lt;a href="https://github.com/WinningSlowly/winningslowly.org/blob/master/pelicanconf.py#L99"&gt;copies&lt;/a&gt; the feed I generate to the output file during its normal build process. As suggested above, I also &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; generate the other feeds which Pelican supports, as we have no need for them; we only care about the podcast feed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This process works equally well, with very little modification, for New Rustacean. In that case, I’m generating the content by running Rust’s documentation tool, &lt;code&gt;cargo doc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to render the “API docs” which serve as show notes. Notice the family resemblance between &lt;a href="http://www.newrustacean.com/show_notes/"&gt;my “show notes”&lt;/a&gt; and, say, the &lt;a href="http://sgrif.github.io/diesel/diesel/index.html"&gt;Diesel docs&lt;/a&gt;, which are both generated the same way. This is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a normal way of building a podcast website; you can hear me explain why I did it this way in &lt;a href="http://www.newrustacean.com/show_notes/e001/index.html"&gt;New Rustacean e001: Document all the things!&lt;/a&gt; In any case, I just take the show note-relevant parts of the documentation and put it in Feeder, generate the feed, and &lt;a href="https://github.com/chriskrycho/newrustacean.com/blob/master/Makefile#L32"&gt;copy that as part of the build process&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="refs" class="references"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section class="footnotes"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, incidentally, &lt;a href="http://www.sap-py.com"&gt;Sap.py&lt;/a&gt; and my &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/sermons.xml"&gt;sermons&lt;/a&gt; feed.&lt;a href="#fnref1"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I stick with Pelican long-term, I might look into adding it anyway, but honestly, I don’t love Pelican. The reasons have little to do with Pelican for itself, and a lot more to do with my particular and somewhat peculiar needs. That’s a post for another day. In any case, I’m likelier to use anothe generator—even one I write myself!—than to do the work to make Pelican do what I want.&lt;a href="#fnref2"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn3"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technically, Rust’s documentation tool is &lt;code&gt;rustdoc&lt;/code&gt;, which &lt;code&gt;cargo doc&lt;/code&gt; wraps around. I never actually use &lt;code&gt;rustdoc&lt;/code&gt; directly, though.&lt;a href="#fnref3"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

As with the other posts in this series, these are off-the-cuff impressions, which may be inaccurate in various ways. I’d be happy to hear feedback! Note, too, that my preferences are just that: preferences. Your tastes may differ from mine. &lt;a href="/rust-and-swift.html"&gt;(See all parts in the series.)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rust and Swift both have methods which are attached to given data types. However, whereas Rust takes its notion of separation of data and functions rather strictly, Swift implements them on the relevant data structures (classes, structs, or enums) directly. In other words, the implementation of a given type’s methods is within his e body of the type definition itself in swift, whereas in Rust it is in an &lt;code&gt;impl&lt;/code&gt; block, usually but not always immediately adjacent in the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This goes to one of the philosophical differences between the two languages. As we’ve discussed often in the series, Rust reuses a smaller set of concepts—language-level primitives—to build up its functionality. So methods on a type and methods for a trait on a type are basically the same thing in Rust; they’re defined in almost exactly the same way (the latter includes &lt;code&gt;for SomeTrait&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;impl&lt;/code&gt; expression). In Swift, a method is defined differently from a protocol definition, which we’ll get to in the future. The point is simply this: the two take distinct approaches to the relationship between a given type definition and the implementations of any functions which may be attached to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another important difference: access to other members of a given data type from within a method is &lt;em&gt;explicit&lt;/em&gt; in Rust and &lt;em&gt;implicit&lt;/em&gt; in Swift. In Rust, the first parameter to an instance method is always &lt;code&gt;self&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;self&lt;/code&gt; (or a mutable version of either of course), much as in Python. This explicitness distinction is by now exactly what we expect from the two languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both use dot notation, in line with most other languages with a C-like syntax, for method calls, e.g. &lt;code&gt;instance.method()&lt;/code&gt; in Swift and &lt;code&gt;instance.method()&lt;/code&gt; in Rust. The latter is just syntactical sugar for &lt;code&gt;T::method(&amp;amp;instance)&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;T::method(instance)&lt;/code&gt; where &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; is the type of the instance (depending on whether the item is being borrowed or moved). Given its implicit knowledge of/access to instance-local data, and the distinctive behavior of Swift methods (see below), I don’t &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; the same is, or even could be, true of Swift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of Swift’s &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2015/rust-and-swift-viii.html"&gt;other behaviors around functions&lt;/a&gt;—internal and external names, and all the distinctions that go with those—are equally applicable to methods. Similarly, with the sole change that the first parameter is always the instance being acted on, a Rust methods follow all the same rules as ordinary Rust functions (which is why you can call the struct or enum method with an instance parameter as in the example above).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swift does &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; a &lt;code&gt;self&lt;/code&gt;—it is, of course, implicit. It’s useful at times for disambiguation—basically, when a parameter name shadows an instance name. This will look familiar to people coming from Ruby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strong distinction Swift makes &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2015/rust-and-swift-x.html"&gt;between reference and value types&lt;/a&gt; comes into play on methods, as you might expect, as does its approach to mutability. Methods which change the values in value types (&lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;enum&lt;/code&gt; instances) have to be declared &lt;code&gt;mutating func&lt;/code&gt;. This kind of explicit-ness is good. As we discussed in &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2015/rust-and-swift-x.html"&gt;Part 10&lt;/a&gt;, Rust approaches this entire problem differently: types are not value or reference types; they are either mutably and passed mutably (including as &lt;code&gt;mut self&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;mut self&lt;/code&gt;), or they are not. If an instance is mutable and passed mutably, a method is free to act on instance data. And in fact both languages require that the instance in question not be immutable. In fact, everyone we said in Part 10 about both languages applies here, just with the addendum that private properties are available to methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The distinction, you’ll note, is in where the indication that there’s a mutation happens. Swift has a special keyword combination (&lt;code&gt;mutating func&lt;/code&gt;) for this. With Rust, it’s the same as every other function which mutates an argument. This makes Rust slightly more verbose, but it also means that in cases like this, the existing language tooling is perfectly capable of handling what has to be a special syntactical case in Swift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Swift and Rust let you out-and-out change the instance by assigning to &lt;code&gt;self&lt;/code&gt;, albeit in fairly different ways. In Swift, you’d write a mutating method which updates the instance proper like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="swift"&gt;&lt;code&gt;struct Point {
    var x = 0.0, y = 0.0
    mutating func changeSelf(x: Double, y: Double) {
        self = Point(x: x, y: y)
    }
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Rust, you’d need to explicit pass a mutable reference and dereference it. (If you tried to pass &lt;code&gt;mut self&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;mut self&lt;/code&gt;, it would fail unless you returned the newly created object and assigned it outside.) Note that while the full implementation here is a couple lines longer, because of the data-vs.-method separation discussed earlier, the implementation of the method itself is roughly the same length.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="rust"&gt;&lt;code&gt;pub struct Point {
    pub x: f64,
    pub y: f64,
}

impl Point {
    pub fn change_self(&amp;amp;mut self, x: i32, y: i32) {
        *self = Point { x: x, y: y };
    }
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that though you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; do this, I’m not sure it’s particularly Rustic. My own instinct would be to get a &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;Point&lt;/code&gt; rather than mutating an existing one, in either language, and let the other be cleaned up “behind the scenes” as it were (with automatic memory management in Swift or the compiler’s automatic destruction of the type in Rust)—purer functions being my preference these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can do this with &lt;code&gt;enum&lt;/code&gt; types as well, which the Swift book illustrates with a three-state switch which updates the value type passed to a new value when calling pits &lt;code&gt;next()&lt;/code&gt; method. You can do the same in Rust, with the same reference/dereference approach as above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a three-state switch in Swift:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="swift"&gt;&lt;code&gt;enum ThreeState {
    case First, Second, Third
    mutating func next() {
        switch self {
        case First:
            self = Second
        case Second:
            self = Third
        case Third
            self = First
        }
    }
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the same in Rust:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="rust"&gt;&lt;code&gt;enum ThreeState { First, Second, Third }
impl ThreeState {
    pub fn next(&amp;amp;mut self) {
        match *self {
            ThreeState::First =&amp;gt; *self = ThreeState::Second,
            ThreeState::Second =&amp;gt; *self = ThreeState::Third,
            ThreeState::Third =&amp;gt; *self = ThreeState::First,
        }
    }
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both languages also have what Swift calls “type methods”, and which you might think of as “static class methods” coming from a language like Java or C♯. In Swift, you define them by adding the &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;class&lt;/code&gt; keywords to the &lt;code&gt;func&lt;/code&gt; definition. The &lt;code&gt;class func&lt;/code&gt; keyword combo is only applicable in &lt;code&gt;class&lt;/code&gt; bodies, and indicates that sub-classes may override the method definition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="swift"&gt;&lt;code&gt;struct Bar {
    static func quux() { print(&amp;quot;Seriously, what&amp;#39;s a `quux`?&amp;quot;) }
}

func main() {
    Bar.quux()
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Rust, you simply drop &lt;code&gt;self&lt;/code&gt; as a first parameter and call it with &lt;code&gt;::&lt;/code&gt; syntax instead of &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; syntax:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="rust"&gt;&lt;code&gt;struct Bar;
impl Bar {
    pub fn quux() { println!(&amp;quot;Seriously, what&amp;#39;s a `quux`?&amp;quot;); }
}

fn main() {
    Bar::quux();
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual, Rust chooses to use existing language machinery; Swift uses new (combinations of) keywords.&lt;/p&gt;

As with the other posts in this series, these are off-the-cuff impressions, which may be inaccurate in various ways. I’d be happy to hear feedback! Note, too, that my preferences are just that: preferences. Your tastes may differ from mine. &lt;a href="/rust-and-swift.html"&gt;(See all parts in the series.)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i class="editorial"&gt;A note on publication: I had this drafted in early January and simply forgot to publish it. Whoops!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As noted in &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2015/rust-and-swift-x.html"&gt;my discussion of the product types in Rust and Swift&lt;/a&gt;, Swift distinguishes between classes and structs, with the former being reference types and the latter being value types. All structs are value types in Rust. (That you can wrap them in a pointer for heap-allocation with one of the smart pointer types, e.g. &lt;code&gt;Box&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Rc&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Arc&lt;/code&gt;, doesn’t change this fundamental reality.) This underlying difference gives rise to one the big difference between Swift classes and Rust structs: a constant &lt;code&gt;class&lt;/code&gt; instance in Swift can still have its fields mutated; not so with a Rust &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt; instance. But also not so with a &lt;em&gt;Swift&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt; instance, as it turns out! There isn’t a straightforward way to do this with &lt;code&gt;Box&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; in Rust; you &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; do it with something like an &lt;code&gt;Rc&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Arc&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swift’s &lt;code&gt;lazy&lt;/code&gt; keyword, and associated delayed initialization of properties has, as far as I know, no equivalent whatsoever in Rust. And while I can see the utility in principle, I’m hard-pressed to think of any time in my working experience where the behavior would actually be useful. Rather than having &lt;code&gt;lazy&lt;/code&gt; properties, I would be far more inclined to separate the behavior which should be initialized at a later time into its own data structure, and supplying it via &lt;em&gt;inversion of control&lt;/em&gt; if it is necessary for an actions taken by other data structures. (This seems—at first blush at least—to be a way of supporting the un- or partially-initialized data types possible in Objective C?)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swift has computed properties, a concept familiar to Python developers (and relatively recently introduced in JavaScript). These can e quite handy, as they let you define a property to be accessed like any other (&lt;code&gt;someInstance.theProperty&lt;/code&gt;) while being defined with functions which compute the value dynamically. A common, trivial example: if you defined a &lt;code&gt;Person&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;firstName&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;lastName&lt;/code&gt; members, you could define a computed property, &lt;code&gt;fullName&lt;/code&gt;, which was built using the existing values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rust doesn’t have computed properties at all. This is because of its design decision to deeply separate &lt;em&gt;data&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;em&gt;behavior&lt;/em&gt;, essentially stealing a page from more pure-functional languages (Haskell etc.). This is (one reason) why you don’t define the implementation of a &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt; method in the same block as the members of the struct. See an excellent explanation &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/2uvfic/why_doesnt_rust_have_properti%20es/cocmunq"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also closely related the way Rust favors composition over inheritance (by making the latter impossible, at least for now!). By separating &lt;code&gt;impl&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;enum&lt;/code&gt;, Rust makes it not only straightforward but &lt;em&gt;normal&lt;/em&gt; to define new behavior for a given item separately from the data description. This, combined with the use of traits (like Swift’s protocols) as the primary way of sharing behavior between objects, means that you don’t have to worry about conforming to some interface when you define a given type; it can always&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; be defined later, even by entirely other modules or even other crates (packages).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In any case, the result is that it’s not at all Rustic&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to have something like getters or setters or computed properties. It makes sense to have them in Swift, though, which has a more traditionally object-oriented type system (though with some neat additions in the form of its &lt;code&gt;protocol&lt;/code&gt; type classes, which are analogous to Rust’s &lt;code&gt;trait&lt;/code&gt;s—but we’ll come to those in a future post). This is a wash: it’s just a function of the slightly different approaches taken in object design in the two systems. If you have a Swift-style type system, you should have computed properties. If you have a Rust-like type system, you shouldn’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m shocked—utterly shocked!—to find that Swift provides a default &lt;code&gt;newValue&lt;/code&gt; argument for setters for computed properties, and shorthand for defining read-only properties. By which I mean: I find this kind of thing entirely unsurprising at this point in Swift, but I don’t like it any better. Making so much implicit just rubs me the wrong way. Once you know the language, it’s fine of course: you’ll recognize all the patterns. It just seems, in an interesting way, to add cognitive load rather than reducing it. That may just be me, though!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, Swift also allows you to set watchers on given properties—functions called with the new or the removed value whenever the value of the computed property is updated or touched for any reason. It has two of these built in: &lt;code&gt;willSet&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;didSet&lt;/code&gt;. You can override these to get custom behavior when a normal property is about to change. (You can of course just implement the desired behavior yourself in the &lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt; method for a computed property.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since Rust doesn’t have properties, it doesn’t have anything analogous. I can’t think of a particularly straightforward way to implement it, either, though you might be able do some chicanery with a trait. Of course you can always define a setter method which takes a value and optional callbacks for actions to take before and after setting the value; the thing that’s nice in Swift is that it gives you these as built-in capabilities within the language itself. (Now I’m wondering if or how you could implement an &lt;code&gt;Observable&lt;/code&gt; trait, though! Might have to play with that idea more later.) It’s worth remembering , in any case, that Rust doesn’t have these &lt;em&gt;because it doesn’t have properties&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curiously, Swift provides the same functionality for “global” and “local” variables in a given context. In both cases, this is suggestive of the underlying object model for both modules and functions in Swift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now I’m curious what the representation of a module is in Swift; is it part of the general object system in some way?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This likewise gets me asking: what &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a module in Rust? It’s a block item, clearly, and accordingly defines a scope (as do functions, if and match expressions, and so on). It’s &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a compilation unit (as it is in C or C++). What other machinery is attached to it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both of these questions can be answered by reading the source code for the languages (&lt;a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust"&gt;Rust&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/apple/swift"&gt;Swift&lt;/a&gt;), of course. Putting that on my to-do list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swift also has &lt;em&gt;type properties&lt;/em&gt;: values common to all instances of a given type. These are directly analogous to &lt;em&gt;class properties&lt;/em&gt; (or &lt;em&gt;class attributes&lt;/em&gt;) in Python or prototype properties in JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rust doesn’t have anything like this to my knowledge. You could accomplish something similar using a module-level variable with a &lt;code&gt;'static&lt;/code&gt; lifetime,&lt;a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; much as you could in C—but that wouldn’t be an item on the type itself, of course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt; declaration of item in Swift suggests what a possible implementation might look like in Rust: defining a member like &lt;code&gt;a_static_long: 'static i64&lt;/code&gt;. There might be some interesting challenges around that, though; I don’t know enough to comment meaningfully. At the least, it seems like it would be an odd fit with the rest of the memory management approach Rust takes, and it would make it a bit harder to reason correctly about the behavior of data in a given type. (There are certainly issues there around mutability guarantees and lifetime checking!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of the differences in underlying approach to data types and implementation, this is one of the areas where the superficially (and sometimes actually) similar languages diverge &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;leaving aside details about &lt;code&gt;trait&lt;/code&gt; specialization &lt;a href="https://github.com/aturon/rfcs/blob/impl-specialization/text/0000-impl-specialization.md"&gt;still being hashed out&lt;/a&gt; in Rust&lt;a href="#fnref1"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is now my preferred term for “idiomatic Rust”—directly analogous to “Pythonic,” but with the upside of being an actual word, and one with pleasantly evocative connotations to boot.&lt;a href="#fnref2"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn3"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s nothing analogous to Rust’s concept of explicit lifetimes in Swift, as far as I can tell. The &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt; keyword in Swift, like that in C, Objective-C, and C++, is &lt;em&gt;sort of&lt;/em&gt; like Rust’s &lt;code&gt;'static&lt;/code&gt; lifetime specifically, for variables at least—but Rust’s lifetime is substantially more sophisticated and complex than that analogy might suggest.&lt;a href="#fnref3"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fired up and played the demo for &lt;a href="https://www.elitedangerous.com"&gt;Elite Dangerous&lt;/a&gt; on my Parallels VM. Made me want to buy it. But of course, I’d prefer to play it natively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, it’s available for Mac. But my (more than a decade old) joystick doesn’t have any support on OS X. No drivers, full stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good evening. Let’s pray before we begin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Gracious God, may your word be clear in our hearts. May your Spirit open our minds to see you more clearly and love as you have loved us. May we see you, and may I not obscure you. Thank you for revealing yourself to us.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="introduction" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our text for this evening is Philippians 2:1–11. It might be a familiar passage to many of you, but I think it might also be a surprising passage to you. It was for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know if you’ve ever been walking along someplace familiar and had something prompt you to stop and notice something about your surroundings that you had never seen before. Maybe you went back to the house you grew up in, and the house is the same, but you aren’t—and you notice the little cracks in the ceiling. &lt;em&gt;Were those always there?&lt;/em&gt; You look at the wall in your older sister’s bedroom. &lt;em&gt;Was it always that color? I thought it was lighter than that.&lt;/em&gt; You go down the stairs into the basement, and “Yup, they always creaked like that,” your mother tells you. You start to ask about the way the basement smells and she just shakes her head at you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It had been a while since I read this passage, and it kind of felt like thinking you had grown up in a &lt;em&gt;really nice house&lt;/em&gt; and going back and discovering that it was &lt;em&gt;mansion&lt;/em&gt;. But whether you’ve read this passage a hundred times, or this your first time opening a Bible, God is inviting us into a beautiful mansion tonight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="believers-called-to-humble-selfless-unity-215" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Believers called to humble, selfless, unity (2:1–5)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we come to Philippians 2, Paul has just spent the first chunk of a letter to these Christians in Philippi—good friends to him, people who have supported his ministry—about his circumstances… which aren’t great, frankly. He wrote this letter from prison. But, one way or another, he has seen a great many people hear the good news about Jesus as a result of his in prison. But he also knows that the Philippians are having a hard time, and he knows that they need encouragement in their faith. He knew that when things get hard—whether that’s persecution, physical or mental illness, death among your friends or family, losing jobs—when life gets hard, we can turn on each other. And Paul called the Philippians, in the midst of their trials—God is calling us, tonight, in the midst of our trials—to something different: to a &lt;strong&gt;humble, selfless, unity&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s read:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;So if there is any encouragement in Christ, any comfort from love, any participation in the Spirit, any affection and sympathy, &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;complete my joy by being of the same mind, having the same love, being in full accord and of one mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;section id="four-reasons" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Four reasons&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul opens with four &lt;em&gt;reasons&lt;/em&gt; for people to live with this humble, selfless unity. “If there is any…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;encouragement in Christ&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;comfort from love&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;participation in [which could also read fellowship in or with] the Spirit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;affection and sympathy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If there is any,” he says. Is there any? Well, yes. There &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; encouragement in Christ. We &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; find comfort from being loved, by God and by each other. As believers, we do have fellowship with the Spirit, and through him with Christ and the Father, and of course with each other too. We do have God-given affection and sympathy for each other, and even for non-believers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, Paul is using that “if” to quietly point the Philippian believers to a &lt;em&gt;reality&lt;/em&gt;. When he asks them to complete his joy if these things are true, he’s saying, “Look, these four things &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; true.” You &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; encouragement; comfort; fellowship; affection and sympathy. And just as they did, so do we.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So given those four good reasons, Paul asks them to complete his joy. As he has told them already, earlier in the epistle, he already has great joy—in seeing the gospel go forth. He even rejoices when people preach the gospel in an attempt to make him jealous. But his joy isn’t complete without something else. If these four reasons are the foundation for that completion, the finished building is &lt;strong&gt;humble, selfless, unity&lt;/strong&gt;. But what we might ask: what is the structure of that finished building?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="three-ways" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Three ways&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three. Four foundation stones, and three pillars on that base. Paul told his friends they would complete his joy—they would fill it up—by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;being of the same mind&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;having the same love&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;being in full accord and of one mind&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(If you’re worried about my counting: affection and sympathy go together, and so do “being in full accord and of one mind.” If you have true affection for someone, you will feel sympathy for her when she is struggling. If you’re in full accord with someone, it’s like you and he share a mind. So: four foundation stones, and these three pillars.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what we see in these three pillars is that these three ways are really &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; way. They’re one structure. And that &lt;em&gt;one way&lt;/em&gt;, is to be &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt;. That one way is &lt;em&gt;unity&lt;/em&gt;. Joy, for the apostle, and I think it is fair to say God’s joy in our fellowship, is complete when we are truly unified. Not identical, but unified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how? &lt;em&gt;How&lt;/em&gt; do we have the same mind? &lt;em&gt;How&lt;/em&gt; do we have the same love? &lt;em&gt;How&lt;/em&gt; can we be in full accord and of one mind? That seems rather abstract. If I sat down my three-and-a-half year old and my 20-month old and said, “Okay, Ellie and Kate, you need to have unity between you two,” they would just stare at me. Ellie, the older one, might say, “Yes, daddy!” just to be good, but they wouldn’t know what to do with it. Kate, the younger one, would probably yell “No!” because she’s a toddler and we’re working on that right now. And wherever you are: whether you’re saying, “Okay…” but you don’t really get it, or you’re saying “No, no way! Have you met these people?” Paul draws us forward. He gives us some help, makes it a little more concrete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="two-contrasts" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Two contrasts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul gives us two pairs of contrasts to help us see a little more clearly what this kind of unity looks like. Capstones to match the foundation, if you will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Do nothing [, he says in v. 3,] from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility count others more significant than yourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s the first capstone, the first contrast. Not selfish ambition, not conceit, but humility, and counting others more important than yourself. So we see first that this unity is &lt;em&gt;humble&lt;/em&gt; unity. It comes becomes I’m valuing you above me. I’m not trying to exalt myself. I’m thinking of how I can make you do well instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verse 4 shows us the second contrast, the second capstone:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This unity, then, is also &lt;em&gt;selfless&lt;/em&gt;. When we’re healthy, we don’t just aim to get our own. “Looking out for number one!” No, instead, we help others accomplish their hopes. We give of our time; our money; our sleep; our space – to help others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this is the church. This is the kind of building we’re supposed to be. As Paul puts it in Ephesians, we’re being built together into a temple for God—a temple of people known for their &lt;strong&gt;humble, selfless, unity&lt;/strong&gt;—their love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have these four foundations: encouragement in Christ, comfort from love, fellowship with the Spirit, and affection and sympathy. We have three pillars of unity: being of the same mind, having the same love, being in full accord and of one mind. We have two capstones: calls to humility and selflessness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you might be asking now, “How? I want that unity; I even want to be selfless and humble, even if that sounds kind of hard. But I don’t know &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt;.” And to that, Paul says, “Don’t worry; I’ll give you an example. In fact, here is &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; example.” And he shows us Christ—verse 5: “Have this mind among yourselves, which was also in Christ Jesus…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="the-foundation-of-humble-selfless-unity-2611" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. The foundation of humble, selfless, unity (2:6–11)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mind of Christ! That’s a heady thing to think about. But for Paul, it’s deeply practical, in fact. He gives us a very succinct summary of Jesus’ ministry. And what was Jesus like? He was humble. He was selfless. (And if you’re thinking, “But what about unity?” you’re right. Hold on to that thought. We’ll come back to it.) Let’s start by looking at Christ’s example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="christ-humbled-himself" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Christ humbled himself&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;who [Christ Jesus], though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped [—something to be held onto—], &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;but emptied himself, by taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men. &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we see here is one of the great mysteries our faith. God became man. We could take a dozen sermons on this point alone. But Paul has something very specific for us to see from the Incarnation here. Whatever prerogatives we might have—whatever money, whatever fame, whatever position or status—the Son had more. And Jesus Christ lived as a servant. He didn’t hold onto what was his (and it really was his, by right!). He came as one of us. When you read here, “in the likeness of man,” don’t think “he was kind of like us.” Hebrews tells us that he was &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; was we are—yet without sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that degradation goes down and down and down. He became a baby, who needed to be changed. He dealt, like my older daughter does, with younger siblings who tormented him. He was teased by other children. He went through puberty and had his voice go all scratchy. He worked for many years in obscurity. When he started his ministry, he was rejected as often as accepted, loved for his miracles and not for the God he revealed, mocked even by his own family, and wandered around without a home. Remember, the God of all the universe. And ultimately, he died. Died a sinner’s shameful death. He took our humiliation. And through all of it, he did not complain, he just served. So Christ is our model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A convicting model, at least for me. Jesus, the real flesh-and-blood Jesus who was tempted just like us, is the perfect man. He is what it &lt;em&gt;means&lt;/em&gt; to be human rightly. And he served. He’s the rightful king! And he served. Do I serve like that? Do you? Or do we demand our rights?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="the-father-exalted-christ" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Father exalted Christ&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, as we come into these final verses, we see what at first might seem like a bit of a strange turn. Paul is trying to teach us about this kind of &lt;strong&gt;humble, selflessness,&lt;/strong&gt;—and yes, &lt;strong&gt;unity&lt;/strong&gt;. Hmm. And we were tracking along, as we saw the concrete example of Jesus living and dying selflessly. Feeling conviction, even; I certainly was and am. But then we get to this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every name, &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is, at first blush, a bit of a challenge. “Okay. I mean, it’s good that Jesus is exalted. But how does it fit? Am &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; going to be exalted? Am I supposed to serve because Jesus was exalted? What’s going on here?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two parts to this. One of them is, yes, that Jesus is Lord. We are citizens of his kingdom, and if his people lived like that, his people should &lt;em&gt;certainly&lt;/em&gt; live like that. So that is one part of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there is something else going on here, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this—oh, this! What do we see here? We see the Father exalting the son. He &lt;em&gt;highly&lt;/em&gt; exalted him. He gave him the name that is above every other name. The Father wants every one to say, “Jesus is Lord!” The Father wants everyone to bow down and worship Jesus. And Jesus, the Son—he’s doing all of this, he’s becoming a servant, taking on human nature, dying, on a cross to what end? To the glory of the Father!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a little glimpse here into something… &lt;em&gt;awesome&lt;/em&gt;. We see the Father, saying to the Son, “Let me exalt you!” And Jesus says to the Father, “All the glory is yours!” And the Father to the Son, and the Son to the Father, back and forth, and back and forth, forever. This is the life of the trinity. This is the eternal life of the triune God: &lt;strong&gt;humble, selfless, unity&lt;/strong&gt;! Love!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is what we’re meant to be. This is what the church is for. This is what &lt;em&gt;humanity&lt;/em&gt; is for: men and women made in the image of God—&lt;strong&gt;humble, selfless, unity&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The life of the Trinity, in the life of the church. This is the building we’re meant to be. This is the temple. This is the mansion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul has taken our question: “How do I live like that?” and he’s answered it by showing us how the life of the triune God took on flesh, and lived among us. Was our servant. Died for us. He says: “How Christ lived is how we are meant to live.” And he reminds us, back there in v. 1: “If there is any encouragement in Christ, any comfort from love, any participation in the Spirit—any fellowship with the Spirit, remember; any affection and sympathy, complete my joy…” We have fellowship with the Spirit. That’s where our unity comes from: not common interests, not shared experiences, not being the same age, or sex, or ethnicity, or social standing, or economic status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re meant to be a little picture, every day, of the Trinity. And the way we do that, is by living like Christ did. We choose, every day, to serve the people around us, instead of ourselves. We choose, every day, not to put ourselves first, but to put others first. We choose, every day, not to make ourselves look great, but to love others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="exhortation" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Exhortation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brothers and sisters, here is my challenge to you today. Fill up your joy, and fill up my joy, and fill out our Triune God’s joy in you!—by loving one another as he has loved us. This kind of &lt;strong&gt;humble, selfless, unity&lt;/strong&gt; is not a burden. It is what we are for. And yes, in this fallen world, it is hard sometimes. But we have the Spirit. We participate in God’s own love. Mystery— awesome mystery! Let us love one another. Let us count one another more important than ourselves. Let us look not only to our own interests, but to each other’s. Let us live in the &lt;strong&gt;humble, selfless, unity&lt;/strong&gt; of our King’s kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And friend, if you are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a believer, and you look at this picture, I hope you’re thinking, “Yes. That’s what the world ought to look like.” Because it is. And it’s beautiful. We’re not meant not for self-absorption. We’re meant to live like Christ did. So I challenge you: call Christ lord. Let his death be yours, and his resurrection, too—come walk after him with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us pray to our loving, selfless, humble God of unity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;God we praise you, who are love and light forever. Thank you for your love—for sharing it with us, humbly and selflessly; for drawing us into your love and restoring us to what you designed us for. Thank you for building us into a temple for your Spirit. Help us walk in this same humble, selfless unity. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

We decided to do a little writing challenge! The rules of our challenge were: we had 30 minutes to write at least 500 words, it had to be fantasy, it had to be about someone the opposite sex of the author, and it had to be about someone elderly. This is mine.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The door opened, but it did not creak. It &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; creaked. Like Janice’s bones in the morning, it creaked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She frowned at the back of the door facing her. Someone stood there, it seemed; a shadow darkened the floor by the doorway. Her eyes were rheumy enough, and the room layout ridicuous enough, that she couldn’t say more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Who is it? she called out. Croaked out, more like, but that was the price of eighty years’ of cigarettes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;«Time.» Helpful response, that was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What’s that?” She was still croaking. She coughed, tried to clear her throat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;«Time,» he said again. She thought it was a he, but his voice sounded funny. Far away. Then again, her ears had been going for long enough now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Time? Kids aren’t coming today, so you can have all you want. But who are you?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;«It. is. time.»&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shadow looked darker. She frowned, pursed her lips, and shook her head. “Young man—you are young, aren’t you? You don’t sound old—come in here and sit down and explain yourself.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;«I. sit. for. no. one.»&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Janice blinked a few times. She sat back in her chair. She tried to take a deep breath, coughed, coughed some more, gave up on the deep breath, contented herself with a swallow instead. That seemed more appropriate anyway. But no, she was just being absurd. Old, even.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well, all right, then, but come in where I can see you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;«No. it. is. your. time.»&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She swallowed again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Time for what?” Just to be sure. The shadow was still getting darker. It could have been her eyes, but the rest of the room was the same as before: fuzzed out to an irritating degree, but bright enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;«Time. to. depart.»&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Son, or whatever you are” (she no longer thought it was anyone who ought to be called son, or daughter for that matter) “be clear. I don’t have time for whatever your game is. Had enough of foolishness twenty years ago.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;«It. is. time. for. you. to. depart. this. life.»&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, then. One thing to have a half-cocked notion of a thing like that, but another hear it from the mouth of… time? itself. “Is it now?” she managed. “Well, you took long enough getting here. Family’s been telling me that for a good twenty years now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where the shadow stood on the floor in front of the door was all dark now. Shaped something like a man, for all her blurred sight could make out, but black as a night when all the moons were down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was ready, though. Ready as you could be. “Do you announce yourself to &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; like this, or just half-blind old ladies?” She sounded like a bullfrog with a sore throat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shadow answered. «All. those. who. have. time.»&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Helpful. Not that it mattered. She &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; ready. She was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shadow was suddenly before her. A starless, moonless night. Time indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Janice stood up. Face it on your feet, she’d always said. To the blazes with that, now, she concluded. Face it asleep in the night was a better plan. But here she was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She could still run. Jump a little even. So she did. She threw herself at the shadow, and as she came to it, she thought she saw stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then everything was gone except the stars, whirling before suddenly clear eyes. Ten billion galaxies whirled; pulsars flamed and danced in time; suns flared and planets spun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Green grass, dusted with snow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;«You. have. time.»&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She looked up. Stars, not night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;«Spend. it. well.»&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She stood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong: I’m sympathetic to that desire for concrete examples. I’m interested in these kinds of things not primarily for their intellectual value but for their pragmatic value (though I don’t think those two are as distinct as many people do). I’d &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; love to see some more real-world examples in those discussions. All too often, the discussions of types in Haskell end up being quite abstract and academic—no surprise, given the language’s origin. But I’m also aware that quite often it’s difficult to see how a given kind of abstraction is useful without jumping into a language which has that abstraction available and &lt;em&gt;using&lt;/em&gt; it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People often get turned off by Haskell (and other similarly high-abstraction languages like Scala) because of challenging terms like &lt;em&gt;monad&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;applicative&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;functor&lt;/em&gt;, and so on. And again: I get that. To grok Haskell, you need to wrap your head around a lot of &lt;em&gt;math&lt;/em&gt; ideas—mainly various properties of &lt;em&gt;sets&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I remember feeling the same way six years ago when I started playing with JavaScript and jQuery and every tutorial out there simply assumed existing familiarity and comfort with functions as arguments or return values. Coming from the world of Fortran and C, my head ached for weeks as I tried to make sense of what I was seeing. Even when I finally got it, &lt;em&gt;I didn’t like it&lt;/em&gt;. Over the last several years, though, I’ve become increasingly comfortable and even reliant on closures, composition of functions to transform data, and so on as I worked regularly in Python and JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That experience has taught me that my current inability to see the utility of a given abstraction means little about the abstraction. It’s primarily an indicator of my own inexperience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the question of the utility &lt;abbr&gt;HKTs&lt;/abbr&gt; in general—in Haskell, Rust, or somewhere else—I don’t have the knowledge myself (yet) to supply a good answer. Heck, I can’t even &lt;em&gt;explain&lt;/em&gt; them very well. (&lt;a href="http://adriaanm.github.io/research/2010/10/06/new-in-scala-2.8-type-constructor-inference/"&gt;Other people can, though!&lt;/a&gt;) But I can say that reading &lt;a href="https://gumroad.com/l/maybe-haskell"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maybe Haskell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; showed me clearly that such things can be very useful. Even if I am not yet comfortable using that tool, I see how learning to use it would be profitable in the long-term. And like any good tool, even if you don’t need it every day… when you want it, you &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; want it.&lt;/p&gt;

I just realized one reason why: the absence of music! 🎶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="refs" class="references"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chris Krycho</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 12 Jan 2016 17:52:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:www.chriskrycho.com,2016-01-12:2016/2016-01-12-1752.html</guid><category>music</category></item><item><title>Trust, Fame, and Deceit</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2016/trust-fame-and-deceit.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href="/2016/women-in-rust.html"&gt;recently noted&lt;/a&gt;, in the course of seeing how my &lt;a href="http://www.newrustacean.com/"&gt;New Rustacean&lt;/a&gt; podcast was doing, that the subscriber list for its Twitter followers was overwhelmingly, terribly male. So I responded a little: I posted publicly about it on Twitter, making known my intention to find some ways within the podcast to feature female Rust developers, just to help make the Rust community that much friendlier to women. (I’m &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/b0rk/status/686150249619013632"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; that it’s actually very welcoming so far, for which I’m grateful!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The response was gratifying in some ways: I got a fair bit of response from within the Rust community, and heard back from a number of women who listen to the show. At least one of them linked to the show, recommending it strongly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was happy about this. And then I started thinking about the way this cycle played out. Everything in it was genuinely well-intended on my part. I very much want to see the tech world in general and open-source software in particular be friendlier and kinder and more respectful to women. I want it to be a genuinely egalitarian space. I would go so far as to say that I think that is essential for it to be a genuinely &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what if those &lt;em&gt;weren’t&lt;/em&gt; my intentions? What if, in point of fact, I was a misogynist pig with a penchant for sexual harassment?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same social media tactics would still work. People who’d experienced my wickedness first-hand would know better, but many wouldn’t. I’d just be a friendly-sounding voice out there on the internet, giving every impression of being on the side of people whose go of things in the tech community has been pretty rough at times. My stature would go up as a consequence. My podcast would grow in popularity. The likely hood of my being a well-liked and well-respected member of the community would only increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the opportunities I would have to abuse that position of influence would all concomitantly increase as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again: that &lt;em&gt;isn’t&lt;/em&gt; me. But unless you know me and see how I live my life, you don’t know that. You don’t know from a tweet, or a blog post, or even a whole public internet history. Sad to say, but &lt;em&gt;people lie&lt;/em&gt;, and they do it for many reasons. When, in the midst of any furor over another revelation of sexual predation from a well-regarded person who has said all the right things, remember that words are cheap. “Actions speak louder than words” is a truism for a reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That doesn’t mean you should mistrust everything you hear or read. It doesn’t mean that behind every nice-seeming person on the internet is actually a creepy psychopath plotting how to manipulate you. It just means that you shouldn’t be surprised to find that, out of the great mass of people who genuinely are friendly and helpful, there are nonetheless a few for whom their friendliness and helpfulness are a manipulative charade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep trusting people. You can’t live your life sanely otherwise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But don’t be surprised when some people aren’t what they seem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If someone acts one way in public but is completely different in private, do whatever you can to deal with it. Above all, if you’re their friend, &lt;em&gt;call them on it&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give grace; people make mistakes. But also don’t assume that just because someone who’s lied repeatedly apologizes, they’re going to change. Giving grace and forgiving people doesn’t mean being blind or naïve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t manipulate people. It’s easy to do it, and the temptation toward popularity can get tangled up even with genuine desires to do good in ways that profoundly complicate your actions. Watch out for it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t let that worry keep you from doing good things for other peoples’ good. Keep your eyes on your own motives while you do it, but &lt;a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+22%3A34-40&amp;amp;version=NIV"&gt;love others as you love yourself.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A thing I’d really, really like to see change—this is from the &lt;a href="http://www.newrustacean.com/"&gt;New Rustacean&lt;/a&gt; Twitter data. Unsurprising, but awful:&lt;/p&gt;

As with the other posts in this series, these are off-the-cuff impressions, which may be inaccurate in various ways. I’d be happy to hear feedback! Note, too, that my preferences are just that: preferences. Your tastes may differ from mine. &lt;a href="/rust-and-swift.html"&gt;(See all parts in the series.)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve still been (slowly) working through the Swift book and comparing Swift and Rust; I have another draft started which I’ll hopefully finish this week. And I still find the comparison deeply profitable. The two languages continue to evolve in interesting ways, and the comparison is all the more interesting &lt;a href="https://github.com/apple/swift"&gt;now that Swift is open-source&lt;/a&gt; and its future &lt;a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution"&gt;open for community input&lt;/a&gt; (just as &lt;a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs"&gt;Rust is&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something I’ve been thinking about for several months, and which the &lt;a href="https://overcast.fm/+CdSzsTIY/1:16:42"&gt;brief discussion of Swift, Go, and Rust&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the latest &lt;a href="http://atp.fm/episodes/151"&gt;Accidental Tech Podcast&lt;/a&gt; brought back to my mind, is the question of what the next generation of systems-level programming language should be. And my answer is: there shouldn’t be &lt;em&gt;just one&lt;/em&gt;. The best possible thing for the space, in many ways, is for there to be a healthy diversity of options and lots of competition in the space. We don’t want to have &lt;em&gt;ten&lt;/em&gt; different systems programming languages to deal with, I think—but three or four or five would be &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; preferable to having one or two (closely related) as we have in the decades of C and C++ dominance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong: both languages (and perhaps especially C) do many things exceptionally well. For all that they are (justly) maligned for some of their problems, the longevity of both C and C++ has a great deal to do with how well they fit the problem domain, and how much they’ve empowered developers to accomplish within that space (which is very, &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; large).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem, though, at least as I see it, is that the existence of only two really serious systems programming languages for the last several decades has led a lot of developers to think that C and C++‘s ways of solving problems are the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; way to solve problems. The languages we use shape the way we think about possible solutions, and when a given language doesn’t recognize entire classes of different approaches, that deeply limits developers’ ability to tackle certain issues. (See also the interesting CppCast &lt;a href="http://cppcast.com/2015/10/andrei-alexandrescu/"&gt;interview with D’s Andrei Alexandrescu&lt;/a&gt; in which he makes similar points.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most obvious thing missing from both is the ability to do truly functional-style programming. C of course is also lacking classes and thus is much more difficult to use for any sort of object-oriented programming.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Neither has anything remotely like Rust’s traits or Swift’s extensions; C++ has only gotten lambdas recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this comes out to mean that the set of &lt;em&gt;tools&lt;/em&gt; available to systems programmer has necessarily been missing any number of things available in languages outside that context. In some cases, this may be a necessary consequence of the kinds of programming being done: when you need totally deterministic memory and compiler behavior, dynamic typing and a non-trivial runtime are simply not options. But in many cases, they are simply a function of the history of the languages’ development and history. Being an ALGOL descendant, and especially a C descendant, means there are some fundamental choices about the language which will differ from those made in a language descended from ML.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of which is to say: C and C++ have been really useful tools in many ways, but having &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; C and C++ available for serious systems programming work over the last decades has left many developers blind to or simply unaware of the real advantages other paradigms might offer them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So going forward, I don’t want there to be &lt;em&gt;a winner&lt;/em&gt; in the systems programming space. I’d rather see D, Rust, Swift, Go, and maybe even a few other contenders all stay strong—finding their own niches and continually pushing each other and learning from each other. That will give us a space in which different languages are free to try out different approaches to the same problems, without being tied to the specific constraints faced by other languages. Built-in greenthreading? Go! Hindley-Milner types, memory safety, and zero runtime? Rust! Something in beween, highly expressive and with different type systems and tradeoffs around memory management, etc.? Swift, or D!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a robust, thriving set of competitors in the market will be good for the languages themselves. But it will also be good for developers. It will take off some of the blinders that come from a single language (or a pair of very closely related languages) dominating the ecosystem. It will make it likelier that people will be more familiar with different programming paradigms. And that can only be a good thing, as far as I’m concerned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2015/rust-and-swift-x.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Previous:&lt;/strong&gt; Classes and structs (product types), and reference and value types.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2016/rust-and-swift-xii.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next:&lt;/strong&gt; Properties: type and instance, stored and computed.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is of course entirely possible to do non-classical OOP; the point is that C entirely lacks &lt;em&gt;language-level&lt;/em&gt; facilities for OOP, inheritance, etc.&lt;a href="#fnref1"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

At the start of the year, I posted a number of goals for my “public” life this year, and I also wrote up a number of personal goals for myself. Goals are well and good, but if I do not evaluate how I did on them, and think about areas I succeeded and areas I failed, and on how I might do better in the future, those goals will not make much difference. (&lt;em&gt;Much&lt;/em&gt; difference, I say, because I have long found that even just having goals makes a difference in how I approach the year.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the start of the year, I posted a list of &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2015/public-ish-plans.html"&gt;“Public-ish Plans”&lt;/a&gt;. My self-evaluation on those counts isn’t amazing. The Winning Slowly goals, I managed: we have separate pages for each season, and we recorded two more seasons—each one better than those before. Hosting things on Digital Ocean and migrating my wife’s blogs off of Blogger and WordPress, not so much (read: not at all, though I did &lt;em&gt;start&lt;/em&gt; writing a Ghost theme for her current WordPress site… and haven’t touched it in at least six months.) I wrote some music this year, but not three minutes worth—you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; hear all 37 seconds of it &lt;a href="https://soundcloud.com/chriskrycho"&gt;on SoundCloud&lt;/a&gt;. I wrote &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/poetry/"&gt;poetry&lt;/a&gt;; I managed to average about one poem a month starting in March. I wrote a few essays, but nothing close to one per month. I posted a whopping two book reviews (out of the six I hoped for), and both of those were written for school. I managed to add a picture to the About page, but I didn’t even come close to blogging about the family on a monthly basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In sum: about 50/50 on those goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, I managed quite a few other things &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; on that list this year. I started learning Rust, and started &lt;a href="http://newrustacean.com/"&gt;a podcast about it&lt;/a&gt; which is easily the most successful online endeavor I’ve ever undertaken, with a good 500 regular listeners. (That’s a small crowd on the internet, but massively more than any writing I’ve done, and actually larger than Winning Slowly’s current audience.) I have basically carried home a major transition effort for my main software development client, and helped them bring a new developer up to speed. I landed a new software development job, doing things I’m much more passionate about, which I’ll be starting in mid-January. I ran a triathlon (and placed third in my age group), and I set another personal record in the half-marathon I ran this fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the lessons I take away from this last year, then, is that it’s important to set goals, but it’s also important to let those goals change over time. Some of those goals are still things I’d like to accomplish—like migrating us to DigitalOcean, and getting Jaimie’s sites off of Blogger especially. Another (fairly obvious one) is prioritizing. I had a lot of major goals for last year, and in retrospect, I think I had &lt;em&gt;too many&lt;/em&gt;. It’s hard to keep all of those in sight of the course of the year, especially with other professional and scholastic demands to meet (themselves often good in their own right).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all of these things in mind, I’m planning to approach 2016 a little differently. I haven’t made formal goals yet, but I have come up with the basic outline I want to use going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I am going to set a single goal in each of five major categories in my life:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;spiritual:&lt;/strong&gt; everything in my walk with God, including my own personal devotions, my involvement in the life of the church, and my “ministry” actions in general&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;family:&lt;/strong&gt; both quantity and quality time spent with my wife and my quickly-growing-up little girls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;personal:&lt;/strong&gt; podcasting, blogging, and writing for &lt;a href="http://mereorthodoxy.com/author/chris-krycho/"&gt;other outlets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;professional:&lt;/strong&gt; working in my new job and as a consultant, and carrying on toward the conclusion of my M. Div.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;health/fitness:&lt;/strong&gt; continuing to stay healthy, including eating well and continuing to stay fit by running and doing triathlon work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that this list is intentionally &lt;em&gt;unordered&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; My spiritual life remains the highest priority, because if my walk with God falters, everything else will go amok. Beyond that, however, the amount of time and effort I invest in each category not only can but should vary over time. Family will broadly remain in the second of those slots, though there may be days or the occasional week where one of the other concerns &lt;em&gt;very temporarily&lt;/em&gt; takes a higher priority. The others will adjust relative to each other as need be: there will be times when school requires more, and so my own writing gets less time, and there will be times when I have more flexibility and so am able to devote more to those personal interests, and so on. The goal here is not the mythical notion of “balance” but rather faithfulness, which has some superficial similarities but ultimately &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2015/faithfulness.html"&gt;plays out rather differently&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m hoping, in light of those goals, to set annual, monthly, and daily goals in each of those categories. The daily goals should help me move toward the monthly goals, and the monthly goals toward the yearly goals. I only get to set one goal in each of those categories for each tier: at five goals, that’s already plenty! I hope that evaluating each day will help me be more focused and faithful, and that situating daily and monthly goals each in light of larger goals will help me actually accomplish those larger goals. We’ll see how it goes, of course. I’ll be back in a week or so with whatever goals I decide to make public in those categories, and again in a year with an evaluation rather like this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;section id="introduction" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent estimates suggest that the United States of America currently spends about three times as much money on our military as the next biggest military spender out there, China. In fact, if you add up the military spending of China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, France, Great Britain, India, and Germany, we still spend more. And remember, China’s and India’s populations are both over four times larger than ours. What’s more, corruption and graft notwithstanding, our military-industrial complex is incredibly advanced. It’s fair to say that America has the most powerful, best equipped, most effective military apparatus in the whole world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet. And yet, as a country, we are very afraid. All of that power can’t protect us from everything. And we are very feared. For all of America’s lofty ideals, we have made a mess of things pretty often. We’ve gotten it wrong. Having power, it turns out, isn’t enough. Having enough power matters, but so does having the right kind of power, and so does how you use that power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we look at Mark 5:1–20, we’re going to see that play out. It’s not just having power that matters. It matters who has the power, and how they use it. Do they torment? Or do they show mercy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll give you a hint: we want power coupled with mercy. You can see, if you look at verse 19, how this whole passage hinges on that. When all is said and done, the man in the middle of this story gets to go tell all his friends and neighbors how much the Lord had done for him—how powerful God is—and how the Lord had shown him mercy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="exposition" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Exposition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;section id="context" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Context&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let’s see how Mark gets us there. As we come to our text, we read: “They came to the other side of the sea, to the country of the Gerasenes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The other side of the sea from what?” you might be asking. Well, from Galilee, where Jesus had been teaching. Back at the beginning of chapter 4, Mark tells us about a series of parables that Jesus taught about his new kingdom. And those parables particularly emphasized people’s response as his kingdom comes. Some reject it entirely; some look excited about it at first, but ultimately aren’t a part of it; and some, a few, &lt;em&gt;really are&lt;/em&gt; citizens of the new kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, back in 4:35, Mark switched to a series of narratives—four stories. This is Mark’s basic strategy: tell us what Jesus said, and then show us what he did. Why? Well, because the parables weren’t just cryptic things Jesus said to confuse people; he was telling his disciples, the ones who had ears to hear, how things really were. Each thing Jesus &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; showed that what he &lt;em&gt;said&lt;/em&gt; was true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His kingdom wasn’t coming the way people thought, or even to the people who thought it was for them. And he wasn’t the kind of king they had in mind, either. He had authority not just over nations and troops, but (as Mark shows us in these four stories), over the sea and the sky, over demons—that’s today’s passage—over incurable illness, even over death. And in each of these events, we see that Jesus wasn’t just a &lt;em&gt;powerful&lt;/em&gt; king. He was also a &lt;em&gt;merciful&lt;/em&gt; king.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, within these four narratives, Mark breaks things down into two pairs of miracle stories which hang together: the storm and the demonized man, and the two healings back on the other side of the sea. Today, we find ourselves in the second half of that first pair. With the storm, the disciples could not save themselves, so Jesus rebuked the storm, and there was a great calm, and the disciples were afraid. We are going to see those same ideas here: someone who cannot save himself, Jesus rebuking something, a great calm as a result, and people being afraid. We will see Jesus’ power and mercy. And we will see a different response than fear—a better one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="beat-1-a-wild-man-516" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Beat 1: A wild man – 5:1–6&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let’s follow Mark on this journey. Verse 2 tells us that “when Jesus had stepped out of the boat, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit”. Verse 6 reiterates the point—“And when he saw Jesus from afar, he ran and fell down before him”—but first Mark wants us to know something about who this man was. Verses 3 through 5 tell us:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He lived among the tombs. And no one could bind him anymore, not even with a chain, for he had often been bound with shackles and chains, but he wrenched the chains apart, and he broke the shackles in pieces. No one had the strength to subdue him. Night and day among the tombs and on the mountains he was always crying out and cutting himself with stones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, this was not a man in need of a little help, an appointment with a counselor. No, here we have a man enslaved. Nothing anyone could do would help him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we have here is Mark establishing both the characters involved, and the “power curve” for the rest of the scene. If you’re reading a superhero comic or watching a superhero movie, you have a sense of how strong everyone is. And of course, this leads to all sorts of conundrums. Who would win in a fight? Next year’s &lt;em&gt;Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Captain America: Civil War&lt;/em&gt; both hinge on this. Who is stronger? Who will win? And of course, if you let the wrong characters in, the game just becomes pointless. I saw an interview with the writers behind &lt;em&gt;Captain America&lt;/em&gt;, where they explained why the Hulk wouldn’t be in the movie. You add in the Hulk, and it’s game over for the other team. There’s no tension in the conflict anymore. The Hulk just wins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s basically the picture Mark shows us in this passage. It’s pretty clear: the demons were stronger. Nothing anyone could do was effective. They couldn’t even keep this man imprisoned; verse 4 has him acting like, well, like the Hulk. They tried chaining him up hand and foot; he just ripped the chains on his wrists off and smashed the fetters on his feet. “No one,” Mark says, “had the strength to subdue him.” Healing him was out of the question. And the man himself was clearly totally under the demons’ control. The “super-villains” had the upper hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the Hulk can be kind of fun to watch, but that’s not what we have here. They made a mockery of this man. We shouldn’t take that lightly. They made him run around screaming, naked, cutting himself, in the midst of the tombs. There is a reason Mark describes him as having an &lt;em&gt;unclean&lt;/em&gt; spirit. The demons were doing everything in their power—short of killing this man—to defile what God had called “very good” and what he had promised to redeem: his humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there’s the power curve when Jesus arrives on the scene; there are the characters. As soon as Jesus gets off the boat, this man comes out to meet him. And then, perhaps surprisingly, given that power curve—but then again, maybe not &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; surprising given what Jesus has already done in this gospel—verse 6 tells us that the man falls down at his knees before Jesus. He goes prostrate. Flat on his face. The way you would kneel before someone absolutely more powerful than you. Jesus’ arrival is clearly a change from the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="beat-2-a-merciful-act-5713" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Beat 2: A merciful act – 5:7–13&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;section id="setup" class="level4"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Setup&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Mark has set the scene for us: here is a man who has been tormented for who knows how long, and as soon Jesus steps off the boat, he man comes running up and throws himself down at Jesus’ feet. That’s quite the welcoming party. Put yourself in the disciples’ shoes for a moment. You’ve just seen Jesus go from sleeping in the back of a boat—in the middle of the kind of storm that scared the Galilean fishermen who are with you—to standing up and telling a storm to be quiet and it does. You’re afraid. And then you get to the other side, still more than a little in shock from that, and a naked man with cuts all over his body comes up to Jesus and throws himself at his feet and starts arguing with him, shouting at him. You might be afraid all over again. And for good reason. Notice that throughout the whole passage, the disciples are just onlookers. This is out of their league, too; so they just watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="beat-2a-jesus-power-5710" class="level4"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Beat 2a: Jesus’ power – 5:7–10&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dealing with the man and his impure spirit is not, however, out of Jesus’ league. Verses 7–10 make it very clear that Jesus is absolutely and unquestionably the most powerful person in this encounter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice, too, that the demonized man is arguing with Jesus because Jesus is arguing with him. Verses 7 and 8 tell us:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He shouted at the top of his voice, “What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? In God’s name don’t torture me!” For Jesus had said to him, “Come out of this man, you impure spirit!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus picked this fight, and it’s not going to go down well for the demons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we know from ancient records that there were both Greek and Jewish exorcists who made it their business to drive out evil spirits. You will find the same in many non-Western cultures today, and—as an aside—I think those cultures probably have the right of it more than we do. It has been said that the greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing people he didn’t exist, and that seems about right. How can you possibly fight something you don’t even believe exists? It’s a brilliant, devious strategic move. You can pull the North Korea strategy—try to constantly rattle your saber to keep everyone afraid of you. Or you can act like an assassin: keep a low profile, and if possible don’t even let your would-be opponents know you exist, until you’ve killed them and caused mayhem. In the hyper-secular West, that seems to be the satanic strategy of the hour, and I think it’s fair to say it’s been reasonably successful for our enemy—even if we know from passages like this one that Jesus’ ultimate victory is guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That &lt;em&gt;wasn’t&lt;/em&gt; the strategy of the day back then, though. And we know from those old records that the general strategy for dealing with demons was to try to use powerful command words and phrases, or to negotiate and bargain, or to use the demon’s name to get spiritual power over them, or to try to use other divine powers to bind them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we don’t see any of that in this passage. The demons recognize Jesus’ power and authority right away. You can see it there in verse 7: as soon as Jesus tells them to leave, they plead with him not to torment them. And you don’t plead with someone not to torment you unless they &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; torment you. By the time Jesus asks for a name in verse 9, the demons have already acknowledged Jesus’ power and authority in the situation. What’s more, they call him “Son of the Most High God” there in verse 7. Now, this title does double duty here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, it is another confirmation of Mark’s claim throughout his gospel: that Jesus is in fact the Son of God. And significantly, the early confessions to that effect all come on the lips of demons he exorcises. The spiritual forces know spiritual authority when they see it, even if the people don’t see it yet. So confirming that Jesus is “the Son of God” is the first thing this does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second thing it does is establish that Jesus isn’t just another player in the spiritual game. Whatever other gods someone might worship, and whatever other claims to divine power someone might offer up, Jesus trumps them all. He is the son not just of &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; god, but of &lt;em&gt;the Most High God&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that there is a legion of demons, as they admit in verse 9, simply heightens the contrast. We knew already that the “impure spirit” was able to torment the man; now we know that it is &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; demons. It doesn’t matter. They’re still reduced to begging and pleading with him: verse 10 tells us that the man—really, the spirits speaking through him—“begged Jesus again and again not to send them out of the area.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, the power curve: Jesus’ authority isn’t even in the same ballpark as anyone else in the story—not the demonized man, not the people who were unable to help him or even restrain him, not the silent disciples, and not even the multitude of demons. He exceeds them all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="beat-2b-jesus-focus-51113" class="level4"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Beat 2b: Jesus’ focus – 5:11–13&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus’ power is only part of the story, though. As we come into vv. 11–13, we can see his &lt;em&gt;focus&lt;/em&gt; as well. And that focus is healing a man in need. Read with me, starting in verse 11:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large herd of pigs was feeding on the nearby hillside. The demons begged Jesus, “Send us among the pigs; allow us to go into them.” He gave them permission, and the impure spirits came out and went into the pigs. The herd, about two thousand in number, rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, this confirms what we already know: they &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; Jesus’ permission. He is in charge. But, second, it also tells us that between the man and the pigs, there wasn’t a contest for Jesus. Not because he didn’t care about pigs. We know from Colossians 1 that the eternal Son of God—who Mark is taking this whole book to tell us about—is the agent of God’s creation of the whole universe; and his powerful word is the reason that the whole universe keeps existing, pigs included. Pigs were part of what he called a “good” creation in Genesis 1. Speaking as a lover of bacon myself, I’m inclined to agree with God’s assessment: pigs are good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, and this is important: people are more important than pigs. You can find any number of modern commentators on this passage asking about the ethical implications of Jesus’ letting the demons destroy the pigs along with themselves in this way. Neither Mark nor Luke or Matthew seem bothered by this point. Neither does Jesus. Pigs matter. Pigs are good. But they don’t matter like people do. And while it is not clear from this passage why Jesus accepted the demons’ request, what is clear is that his mercy toward this man—his compassion on him—trumped any concern for the pigs. Jesus’ focus was healing and saving people. Here, we see clearly that his powerful word is not just for creation, but also for &lt;em&gt;salvation&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tells us something about Jesus’ power and authority. It is &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; power and authority. He is &lt;em&gt;merciful&lt;/em&gt;. And it is so important—&lt;em&gt;extraordinarily&lt;/em&gt; important—that the Son of the Most High God, the king bringing in his kingdom, be merciful. Because as Ephesians 2 tells us, before God intervenes in our lives, we’re all like this man was. We start off dead in our sins, slaves to our lusts and every desire gone wrong and totally unchecked, in the domain of darkness, following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit now at work in the children of disobedience. The demons, in other words. And then Jesus steps in. As the rightful king, he has the power to free us… and he’s a &lt;em&gt;merciful&lt;/em&gt; king, so he &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; free us. That’s good news. That’s gospel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="beat-3-a-fearful-crowd-51417" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Beat 3: A fearful crowd – 5:14–17&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, it doesn’t always &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt; like good news to everyone when Jesus shows up and starts healing people. Remember, Mark is showing us the truth of those parables from back in chapter 4. So we see here the good king who is bringing in his kingdom—in secret now, but someday in glorious light—but we also see those different kinds of soil from the parable of the sower and the seed: some fruitful, some &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; fruitful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at what happens in verses 14 through 17:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those tending the pigs ran off and reported this in the town and countryside, and the people went out to see what had happened. When they came to Jesus, they saw the man who had been possessed by the legion of demons, sitting there, dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid. Those who had seen it told the people what had happened to the demon-possessed man—and told about the pigs as well. Then the people began to plead with Jesus to leave their region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can imagine being one of the herdsmen, seeing the pigs drowned by demons, and being frightened—and maybe they were. But that’s not what Mark says. That’s not why these people were afraid. They were afraid because they saw this man who had been naked, clothed; who had been running and screaming, sitting calmly; who had been out of his mind, now in his right mind. &lt;em&gt;That&lt;/em&gt; was what made them afraid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark has created a sharp contrast here: between this scene and the one that preceded it, the calming of the storm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In both scenes, we see Jesus confronting something far more powerful than ordinary humans can handle: in the first, a terrible storm; in the second, a legion of demons.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In both scenes, we see him exercise his powerful word for mercy: in the first, to save his disciples from the storm; in the second, to save this man from the demons who tormented him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In both scenes, we see the tumult of a broken world, and then calm and peace after Jesus acts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And in both scenes, we see people who are afraid after Jesus acts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there seems to be more than one way to be “afraid” when you see the power of God’s Spirit on display in the person of Jesus Christ. You can be afraid and still want to be with him, like the disciples. Or you can be afraid like these people were—they wanted him to leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, one of these is better than the other. Far better to be with Jesus even if his power is more than you can handle—even if you find that the Son of God is not at all safe. Because he &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="beat-4-an-effective-commission-51820" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Beat 4: An effective commission – 5:18–20&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Mark wants to take us even further than the disciples’ example. He wants us to see that we do not need to be afraid. Because Jesus’ &lt;em&gt;power&lt;/em&gt; is expressed in &lt;em&gt;mercy&lt;/em&gt; to his people. The disciples didn’t really understand who Jesus was yet, didn’t really grasp either his power or his mercy yet, but someone surprising in this story does: an unclean Gentile man who had been tortured by demons. The man Jesus healed. The one to whom he so very powerfully showed mercy. Look! Verse 18:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Jesus was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed begged to go with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He begged! He is the third person to beg or plead in this story. The demons begged not to be destroyed yet—and Jesus surprisingly showed them mercy in that. The people pleaded with Jesus to leave—and Jesus surprisingly showed them mercy in that. And here—at last!—someone begs for the &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; thing: to be with Jesus. The same phrase as when Jesus called the disciples to be with him. And Jesus surprisingly… shows mercy by saying &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; to him. Verses 19 and 20:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus did not let him, but said, “Go home to your own people and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and how he has had mercy on you.” So the man went away and began to tell in the Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him. And all the people were amazed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Go home to your own people”, verse 19 says—some translations say “to your friends”—“and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and how he has mercy on you.” Precisely &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; this man understood Jesus great power and his great mercy, he had somewhere to be that wasn’t &lt;em&gt;with Jesus&lt;/em&gt; yet. He knew how great God’s power was, and he knew how deep God’s mercy was. So Jesus gave him a commission, and it looks familiar: go tell the nations what God has done. The nations: this is a Gentile, not a Jew; he is in the Decapolis, Gentile country, not Jewish country. “Go tell them about God’s mercy,” Jesus says to him. Because the mercy of God is not just for the Jews. Jesus was not going to be a petty little messiah, king of a corner of Palestine. God’s mercy was for the healing of the nations. And here we see the first taste of that in Mark—because what happened? “…all the people were amazed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark doesn’t tell us here what came of this, what the fruit was. We don’t know how many of those who were amazed were just apparently fruitful soil, where the seed sprung up and soon withered. But it is clear that there was at least &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; who was good soil. And if Jesus’ ministry in the Decapolis in chapter 7 is any indication, it seems the Spirit may well have been using this man’s seed-sowing to prepare a great harvest some day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One more thing to see here: a detail, but not a little thing. Unlike the disciples, who hadn’t &lt;em&gt;gotten it&lt;/em&gt; yet—this man proclaimed &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; what he should have. Notice, Jesus tells him to say what “the Lord” had done for him. From a Jew, including Jesus, that meant “Yahweh,” the God of Israel. And in verse 20, “the man went away and began to tell… how much &lt;em&gt;Jesus&lt;/em&gt; had done for him.” And rightly so. The mercy of Yahweh, the God of Israel, is the mercy of Jesus, the Son of the &lt;em&gt;Most High God&lt;/em&gt;—the God over every pagan deity, over every demonic power, over every human heart, over &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="summation" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, John Piper was preaching a missions sermon, and he started with Mark 5:19. You can see why. It’s the heart of the gospel. And Piper summed up the heart of the gospel this way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God sent his Son into the world to save sinners from every nation so that they would glorify him for his mercy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s right. This whole narrative is a microcosm, a little picture, of the gospel, and of the right response to the gospel. Here we have a story of a Gentile man—one of the nations, not a Jew—who was literally enslaved by the powers of hell, set free by Jesus. But not just set free; set free and given a commission. Look there at verse 19 again: “Go home to your friends and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and how he has had mercy on you.” That commission tells us what this story is about. And the center of that commission is the center of Mark’s gospel. And in fact, it’s the center of the whole Bible. It’s the center of this &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; story we are all part of. God’s power, expressed in mercy, to save people from every nation through Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look how much he has done for us &lt;em&gt;because of that mercy&lt;/em&gt;! He saves people like you and me, people from every nation who can’t save themselves, and he invites them into his kingdom, and he gives them a mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="invitation" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Invitation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is to say, he gives &lt;em&gt;us&lt;/em&gt; a mission. If you are a Christian in this room—if you have said to Jesus, “Let me be with you”—then he has said to you, “Go and tell your friends how much the Lord has done for you and how he has shown mercy to you.” Every one of us should want others to know how God has saved us. If you aren’t doing that, I challenge you: tell the people around you! Tell your friends, your coworkers, your family members. If that’s hard for you—and I understand; it can be—then think back on your salvation. Think about how God has shown mercy to you. Pray for the Spirit to stir you up, to deepen your love for him and your joy in what he has done, so that your telling others isn’t out of guilt, but out of excitement. That’s a prayer he delights to answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And friend, if you are in this room and you are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; in the kingdom? We have a good king, who offers you a pardon for your rebellion. You can be a citizen with us; we were all rebels, too. Come to him. Ask to be with him. Join us as we follow him. He has shown us mercy; he will show you mercy, too. All you have to do is surrender. Lay down your weapons. Ask for mercy. And call him Lord. If that’s you, please: let us walk with you. Come talk with us before you leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s pray. Let’s pray to our powerful, merciful God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="refs" class="references"&gt;

As with the other posts in this series, these are off-the-cuff impressions, which may be inaccurate in various ways. I’d be happy to hear feedback! Note, too, that my preferences are just that: preferences. Your tastes may differ from mine. &lt;a href="/rust-and-swift.html"&gt;(See all parts in the series.)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swift and Rust both have “product types” as well as the &lt;code&gt;enum&lt;/code&gt; “sum types.” In Rust, these are &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt; types; Swift splits them into &lt;code&gt;class&lt;/code&gt;es and &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt;s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Product types” will be much more familiar to programmers coming from a C-like background, or indeed most object-oriented programming languages: these are the same basic kind of thing as classes, structs, and objects in other languages. These include &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the value types which compose them, unlike sum types—&lt;code&gt;enum&lt;/code&gt;—which have &lt;em&gt;only one&lt;/em&gt; of the value types which compose them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right off the bat, I note the Swift book’s somewhat amusing reticence to call out C and C-descended languages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike other programming languages, Swift does not require you to create separate interface and implementation files for custom classes and structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because there’s such a long list of languages not directly descended from C which do that, right? 😉&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rust differs not only from Swift but from every other modern language I have used in not having a constructor &lt;em&gt;syntax&lt;/em&gt; for its instantiations. Whereas C++ has &lt;code&gt;new NameOfType()&lt;/code&gt; and Python has &lt;code&gt;NameOfType()&lt;/code&gt; and Swift has &lt;code&gt;NameOfType()&lt;/code&gt;, “constructors” for Rust &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt;s are just functions which return an instance constructed using literal syntax, by convention &lt;code&gt;NameOfType::new()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s make a &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt; defining a location in a plane, you might do this in Swift (leaving aside initializer values; I’ll come back to those later). These definitions look &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; similar. Swift:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="swift"&gt;&lt;code&gt;struct Point {
    var x: Double var y: Double
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rust:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="rust"&gt;&lt;code&gt;struct Point {
    x: f64,
    y: f64,
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creating the types looks a little different, though. Here’s a constructor in Swift:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="swift"&gt;&lt;code&gt;let point = Point(x: 0, y: 0)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the two ways we could construct the type in Rust, a literal constructor (fairly similar to constructing &lt;code&gt;dict&lt;/code&gt; literals in Python or object literals in JavaScript):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="rust"&gt;&lt;code&gt;let point = Point { x: 0.0, y: 0.0 };&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or a constructor method, &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="rust"&gt;&lt;code&gt;// &amp;quot;Constructor&amp;quot;
impl Point {
    fn new(x: f64, y: f64) -&amp;gt; Point {
        Point { x: x, y: y }
    }
}

let another_point = Point::new(0, 0);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Observe: these two things in Rust are the same under the covers (though if &lt;code&gt;Point&lt;/code&gt;s had non-public internals, they would be non-trivially different: you couldn’t construct it with its private members externally). As usual, Rust opts to keep the language relatively small in these core areas. Given the plethora of ways you can construct something in e.g. C++, I count that a big win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another difference: Swift has &lt;em&gt;syntax&lt;/em&gt; for default values; Rust uses a &lt;code&gt;trait&lt;/code&gt; instead. In Swift, you simply supply the default value in the definition of the &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;class&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="swift"&gt;&lt;code&gt;struct Point {
    var x = 0.0 var y = 0.0
}

let point = Point()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Rust, you use &lt;code&gt;std::default::Default&lt;/code&gt;, which provides a standard value for a given type, and for simple types can be supplied by the compiler even for custom types. Here is the equivalent Rust code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="rust"&gt;&lt;code&gt;use std::default::Default;

#[derive(Default)]
struct Point {
    x: f64,
    y: f64,
}

let point = Point::default();&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is reasonable enough, but we can also supply our own custom implementation if we so desire:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="rust"&gt;&lt;code&gt;use std::default::Default;

struct Point {
    x: f64,
    y: f64,
}

impl Default for Point {
    fn default() -&amp;gt; Point {
        Point { x: 0.0, y: 0.0 }
    }
}

let point = Point::default();&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is trivial for this type, but you can see how it could be useful for more complex types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tradeoffs here are our usual suspects: Rust’s re-use of an existing concept/tool within the language (&lt;code&gt;trait&lt;/code&gt;) vs. Swift’s use of syntax. Rust is slightly more explicit, making it obvious that a default value is being created—but Swift is perfectly readable and the syntax is consistent with many other languages, and it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; shorter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both languages use &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; syntax for member access. Swift:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="swift"&gt;&lt;code&gt;println(&amp;quot;The point is: \(point.x), \(point.y)&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rust:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="rust"&gt;&lt;code&gt;println!(&amp;quot;The point is {:}, {:}&amp;quot;, point.x, point.y);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swift lets you define items &lt;em&gt;within&lt;/em&gt; a struct as mutable or constant. So you can create a variable struct instance, with some of its items immutable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="swift"&gt;&lt;code&gt;struct PointOnZAxis {
    var x: Double var y: Double let z = 0.0
}

var point = PointOnZAxis(x: 4.0, 5.0)
point.x = 5.0 point.y = 6.0
// This wouldn&amp;#39;t compile, though:
// point.z = 1.0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is pretty handy for a lot of object-oriented programming approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Rust doesn’t have it. There are ways to accomplish the same thing; this isn’t the end of the world. Still, it’s an interesting omission, and it’s very much by design. Rust &lt;em&gt;used&lt;/em&gt; to have this feature, and dropped it—and for good reason. Say you had a mutable field in a mutable struct, and then an immutable reference to it; should the mutable field be mutable, or immutable, with that reference?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Rusty way to do this is to differentiate between public and private data. The above examples don’t make the public/private distinction particularly clear, because they assume everything is within the same module. However, many times, this will not be the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="rust"&gt;&lt;code&gt;mod geometry {
    pub struct Point {
        x: f64,
        pub y: f64,
    }

    impl Point {
        pub fn new() -&amp;gt; Point {
            Point { x: 0.0, y: 0.0 }
        }

        pub fn set_x(&amp;amp;mut self, x: f64) {
            self.x = x;
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    // Won&amp;#39;t compile: the `x` field is private.
    // let mut p = geometry::Point { x: 0.0, y: 0.0 };

    // Will compile: the `new` method is public.
    let mut p = geometry::Point::new();

    // Won&amp;#39;t compile: `x` isn&amp;#39;t public.
    // p.x = 4.0;
    // You can use the setter, though:
    p.set_x(4.0);

    // You *can* set `y` directly, though, because it&amp;#39;s public.
    p.y = 14.0;

    // You can&amp;#39;t set fields either way if the instance is immutable.
    let q = geometry::Point::new();

    // This fails because `set_x` requires a mutable reference, but `q` is
    // immutable.
    // q.set_x(4.0);

    // This fails because `q` is immutable, and so all its fields are, too.
    // q.y = 14.0;
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an interesting way of handling this issue. Rust takes the fairly standard use of information hiding (one of the basic principles of most object-oriented programming techniques) and combines it with the language’s normal mutability rules to make it so that the mutability of any given instance data is quite clear: all public members are just as mutable as the struct. If a member isn’t potentially publicly mutable, it isn’t publicly accessible. I really like this, though it took some mental readjustment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s one other difference here, and it’s actually one of the areas Swift and Rust diverge substantially. Rust has &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt; for all product types; Swift splits them into &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt; types and &lt;code&gt;class&lt;/code&gt; types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swift &lt;code&gt;class&lt;/code&gt;es have inheritance; there is presently &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; inheritance in Rust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, whereas Rust determines whether to use pass-by-reference or-value depending on details of the type (whether it implements the &lt;code&gt;Copy&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;trait&lt;/code&gt;) and expected arguments to a function, Swift makes that distinction between &lt;code&gt;class&lt;/code&gt; (pass-by-reference) and &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt; (pass-by-value) types. Quirky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not bad, &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt;. But quirky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; I recently bumped into some discussion of data types in C♯ along with C, C++, and Java (&lt;a href="http://joeduffyblog.com/2015/12/19/safe-native-code/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) and discovered that Swift is stealing this idea from C♯, which &lt;a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/0taef578.aspx"&gt;makes the same copy/reference distinction&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;class&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;One consequence of this: in Rust, you’re always rather explicit about whether you’re accessing things by value vs. by reference. Not so in Swift; you have to remember whether the item you’re touching is a &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt; type or a &lt;code&gt;class&lt;/code&gt; type, so that you can &lt;em&gt;remember&lt;/em&gt; whether a given assignment or function call results in a reference or a copy. This is necessary because Swift doesn’t let you make that explicit (trying to hide the memory management from you). And it’s not alone in that, of course; many other high-level languages obscure that for convenience but still require you to think about it in certain circumstances. I’ve been bitten in the past by the value/reference distinction when thinking through the behavior of Python objects, for example, so that’s not a critique of Swift. Moreover, having the distinction between &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;class&lt;/code&gt; types does let you be &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; explicit than you might in e.g. Python about how given data will be handled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I won’t lie, though: I like Rust’s approach better. (Shocking, I know.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All that nice initializer syntax for Swift &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt; types is absent for its &lt;code&gt;class&lt;/code&gt; types, which seems strange to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swift supplies some syntax for object identity, since it’s useful to know not only whether two &lt;code&gt;class&lt;/code&gt; instances have the same data, but are in fact the same instance. You can use &lt;code&gt;===&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;!==&lt;/code&gt;. Handy enough. To get at this kind of equivalence in Rust, you have to use raw pointers (which are often but not always &lt;code&gt;unsafe&lt;/code&gt;; you can do this specific comparison &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; being &lt;code&gt;unsafe&lt;/code&gt;, for example) to check whether the memory addresses are the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

T. Wright, Minneapolis: Fortress, 1996, 741 pages. Reviewed by Christopher Krycho.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="introduction" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few books can claim to represent a substantive entry in both apologetics and hermeneutics, yet this is precisely what N. T. Wright’s &lt;em&gt;Jesus and the Victory of God&lt;/em&gt; accomplishes. In this book, the second in Wright’s massive work on Christians origins,&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; he treats the question of the historical Jesus via a thorough survey of the modern history of interpretation and the contents of the synoptic gospels themselves. The result is a telling well within historic Christian orthodoxy, though often at sharp angles to current historical approaches to Jesus. Along the way, he also marks out a fruitful interpretive path for Christians reading the gospels. The picture he paints of Jesus—a first-century prophet-Messiah who saw himself standing at the capstone of Israel’s history, fulfilling Yahweh’s plans for his people, but in a way no one in his day seemed to expect—is both apologetically compelling and spiritually illuminating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="overview" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wright begins with an introduction designed to orient the reader to the basic challenges confronting any would-be interpreter of Jesus in the modern era. Critical issues abound, and it is impossible to return to a pre-critical reading of the text. But though the historian must deal with any number of problems in interpreting the person of Jesus, these problems are not specific to him; they are endemic to the task of history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wright therefore begins by establishing his criteria for evaluating interpretations of Jesus’ person and program. Any such theory must account for the transition from Judaism to Christianity; it must therefore present Jesus, the lynchpin of that transformation, as not only &lt;em&gt;dissimilar&lt;/em&gt; to both worldviews, but also &lt;em&gt;similar&lt;/em&gt; to both (132). Jesus must have made sense to his Jewish contemporaries, but also profoundly theologically innovative, to create an entirely new community with its own theology and practice. Wright argues Jesus accomplished this via a program in which “[the] symbolic world of first-century Judaism has been rethought from top to bottom, even while its underlying theology (monotheism, election, and eschatology) has been retained” (218)—with Jesus himself at the center of the plan of Israel’s god, uniquely embodying a father-son relationship with &lt;span class="divine-name tetragrammaton"&gt;YHWH&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He argues this thesis in two major parts, one focusing on the work and teachings of Jesus as a messianic prophet, the other focusing on the Jesus’ aims and beliefs as he carried out his program. Along the way, Wright examines a wide and representative sample of Jesus’ reported deeds and teachings. In each case, the data fits the thesis: Jesus was retelling Israel’s story in a new way, with himself at the center of God’s plan to end his people’s long exile. By the end of the volume, Wright can thus conclude:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Jesus] believed himself called, by Israel’s god, to &lt;em&gt;evoke&lt;/em&gt; the traditions which promised &lt;span class="divine-name tetragrammaton"&gt;YHWH&lt;/span&gt;’s return to Zion, and the somewhat more nebulous but still important traditions which spoke of a human figure sharing the divine throne; to &lt;em&gt;enact&lt;/em&gt; those traditions in his own journey to Jerusalem, his messianic act in the Temple, and his death at the hands of the pagans (in the hope of subsequent vindication); and thereby to &lt;em&gt;embody&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span class="divine-name tetragrammaton"&gt;YHWH&lt;/span&gt;’s return. (651)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a simple restatement of typical Christian belief, though of course it accords with it. It goes further, making sense of Jesus’ words and deeds in a way that meets Wright’s criterion of double dissimilarity and double similarity. The thesis passes the test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="assessment" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Assessment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wright’s volume has much to commend it: its historical method, its thoroughness, its broad engagement with opposing views, even its style. Its most significant contributions, though, fall under two basic headings: a challenge to many modern (atheological or even anti-theological) re-readings of the gospels, and a challenge to many current evangelical interpretation of the gospels. Both of these are successful in large measure because of Wright’s care (and flare) in dealing with the material and with other (contrary) treatments of the same data, but it is Wright’s ability to build cogent arguments with that material on this scale which makes this more than a tedious summary of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Against secular, demythologizing, and materialist interpretations of the text, Wright mounts a serious and substantive case for a traditional (though not uncritical) assessment of the historical reliability of the synoptics and their picture of Jesus. Many critics suppose that the picture of Jesus painted by the gospellers must be anachronistic, ideologically-driven or situationally-motivated, or inflated by faith in contradistinction to history. Such readings of Jesus paint him as any variety of figures: a sadly-mistaken apocalyptic prophet; a Stoic philosopher in first century garb; a preacher of progressive ideas of love and tolerance; the author of a new, non-Jewish religion; a preacher of Jewish (or timeless) verities. One suspects, with Wright, that many of these readings find their source not in the text but in the prejudices or preferences of the commentators. Wright’s argument, by contrast, is far more credible than any of these—and not simply because it aligns with the historic confession of Jesus as Messiah and Lord. Rather, his picture of a distinctly Jewish apocalyptic prophet makes the best sense of the actual evidence from the earliest texts, including not only the synoptic gospels but also the early epistles and even the non-canonical literature like the Gospel of Thomas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second major value of the book is its (usually, but not always, quiet) challenge to many &lt;em&gt;Christian&lt;/em&gt; readings of the gospels. Wright accurately notes that many Christian interpreters, perhaps especially in the Protestant tradition, have struggled to make sense of the gospels. Many evangelical readings of the gospels find little or no connection between what Jesus said and did and his crucifixion and resurrection. Indeed, no few of the commentaries this author has read sturggle to make much of the Pharisees’ and Sadducees’ mutual hostility toward Jesus without reducing them to caricatures, or to make sense of many of the parables or their role in Jesus’ ministry. The interpretation Wright proposes accounts for all these issues, and provides a helpful hermeneutic for untangling many of the otherwise perplexing passages in the gospels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wright’s work thus walks a helpful middle ground between misinterpretations on either side. Anachronistic tendencies among both secular and Christians interpreters lead both astray. He was not a modern progressive, nor an unfortunately mistaken apocalyptic street preacher, nor a teller of timeless ethical truths, nor a preacher of a new religion of grace oddly disconnected from Judaism. Rather, he was a Jewish prophet going about the business of offering a subversive interpretation—though one deeply in touch with the Law and Prophets—of &lt;span class="divine-name tetragrammaton"&gt;YHWH&lt;/span&gt;’s promises to his. This is unsurprising. After all, this is precisely how the gospels present Jesus: dissimilar in certain ways from both the Judaism that preceded him and the Christianity that followed him (again: Wright’s criteria of double dissimilarity). Any telling of the historical Jesus must provide an explanation for the transition from Second Temple Judaism to Christianity, and do so on historically plausible grounds. So must any right interpretation of the gospels for Christian piety. Wright’s theory accomplishes this handily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps even more important is the way in which Wright’s work strikes at a kind of nascent docetism among many Christians. While Jesus’ full humanity may be an article of faith for orthodox believers, many fail to think of what exactly that means. Jesus was not merely as a divine mystery speaking timeless truths and then fulfilling a cruciform commission strangely disconnected from his parable-telling, paralytic-healing ministry. Rather, he was a &lt;em&gt;man&lt;/em&gt; standing at the conclusion the line of Jewish men who had called Israel back to faithfulness and proclaimed that Israel’s God was about saving the whole world. Not only does Wright have a Chalcedonian Christology, he is &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; orthodox than many believers: the Jesus painted in this portrait is no less human than divine. Jesus’ sense of vocation, his real temptations and struggles to fulfill that vocation, and even his not-rare, but unconventionally-embodied, claim to Messiahship were the actions of a first-century Jewish &lt;em&gt;man&lt;/em&gt;. To see this clearly is to see exactly what the Fathers meant in their confession of “our Lord Jesus Christ, the same perfect in Godhead and manhood, truly God and truly man… consubstantial with us according to the Manhood, in all things like unto us, without sin…”&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; To miss it is to risk missing the humanity of Christ in all its glory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="application-and-conclusion" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Application and Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wright’s work is to be commended on a number of levels. Its scholarly depth makes it a formidable resource when discussing the historical Jesus, particularly with those who reject the gospels’ claims to present Jesus accurately. Wright’s enjoyable wit makes the length of the work far more manageable. His proposed hermeneutic, though it can be pressed too far, provides a helpful tool for interpreting the synoptics. Most of all, his reminder of the real and true humanity of Jesus is a sharp rejoinder to the functional docetism all too common in evangelicalism. The book is therefore very helpful for both apologetics and exegesis. Whatever their other differences with Wright, pastors and teachers would do well to digest Wright’s work here.&lt;/p&gt;

I finished at 1:24:58, which comes out to be about a 6:29/mile pace. I finished 20th overall, out of thousands of half-marathoners. If that seems fast to you, well, it seems fast to me, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People often ask me how I run so far and so quickly. I always laugh when they ask, because for my part, I haven’t thought of myself as particularly fast—the guys who finished first in my race this year ran over a minute per mile faster than me.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The best half-marathoners in the world are running a 4:30/mile pace! But I grant that a 6:29/mile pace is, in the grand scheme of things, pretty quick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That leads me to the &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; reason I don’t tend to think of myself as fast: my training approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My half marathon times have always been pretty good,&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; but it is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; because I am particularly athletic. As I mentioned in &lt;a href="/2015/how-i-became-a-runner.html"&gt;my first post&lt;/a&gt; in this series: you can ask my high school football coaches. I was never particularly quick, and even now my best mile time is somewhere around 5:30. I knew people even in high school who were in the mid- to low-4:00 range. Still, going sub-6:30 for 13 miles is no joke, and if you had told me even five years ago—after I started running!—that someday I would run the race I did a few weeks ago, I’d have laughed in disbelief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it really is all in the training. I have two things going for me, and only two: I train &lt;em&gt;smart&lt;/em&gt;, and I train &lt;em&gt;consistently&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consistency first: year-round, I am doing some sort of workout six days a week. Throughout the winter and spring, that will look like a mix of running, spin classes at the gym, and swimming as I prep for another triathlon. From now till the end of January or so, I’ll just do pretty much whatever I feel like in that mix, while keeping at it. From February till whatever point early next summer that my triathlon is, I’ll dedicate two workouts a week to each of the sports. Then I’ll slowly transition to nearly-all running. Through the fall, I will run 5–6 days a week, cycling for a commute when weather permits one of those days instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That right there is the single biggest factor in my performance. If &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; did 30–45 minutes a day four days a week, an hour one day a week, and ninety minutes to two hours another day a week, he would get quicker rapidly. If he did that for five and a half years (as I have been), he would likely be in very similar shape to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for training smart, I basically just follow the &lt;a href="http://philmaffetone.com/what-is-the-maffetone-method/"&gt;Maffetone method&lt;/a&gt;. Most of my runs are easy, aerobic runs. Even at the height of my training for a half marathon, when I am running 45–50 miles each week, 80% of my miles are at a conversational pace. (I’ve carried on fifteen-minute-long phone conversations on runs before!) My long runs include a hard, roughly race-pace finish for the last three or four miles, and I do one hard run a week which is half aerobic and half pushing harder than race speed.&lt;a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; But overall, I run a slow-for-me pace most of the time. I use a heart-rate monitor to help me stay in an easy, aerobic training zone, and I simply don’t go over that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That slow-run training pays off in a couple ways. First, it builds up my body’s ability to process energy aerobically (see &lt;a href="http://philmaffetone.com/what-is-the-maffetone-method/"&gt;the Maffetone method article&lt;/a&gt; for details). Second, it’s much easier on my body—I simply don’t have the joint problems or soreness that many runners do. Third, it is &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; easier mentally, because I can enjoy my runs and not feel exhausted after them. That means it’s much easier to do them day after day, and that takes me back to the consistency point from above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you want to run fast: run a lot, and usually run slow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The top finisher came in at 1:10:03 (to my 1:24:48)—a 5:21/mile pace. The record on the course—which isn’t a perfect match for what we ran today, but pretty similar—is 1:04:21, which is about a 4:55 pace. That’s &lt;em&gt;blisteringly&lt;/em&gt; fast.&lt;a href="#fnref1"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my first, in December 2011, I ran a 1:36:32, which is about a 7:23 pace.&lt;a href="#fnref2"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn3"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also occasionally through speed work days; this fall I did one day of hill repeats: a quarter mile pushing &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt; up a hill, a quarter mile easy back down the hill, and a minute of rest. Five miles of that is tough; I’d like to do more in future years.&lt;a href="#fnref3"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

As with the other posts in this series, these are off-the-cuff impressions, which may be inaccurate in various ways. I’d be happy to hear feedback! Note, too, that my preferences are just that: preferences. Your tastes may differ from mine. &lt;a href="/rust-and-swift.html"&gt;(See all parts in the series.)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right off the bat when looking at the definitions for Swift’s and Rust’s &lt;code&gt;enum&lt;/code&gt; types, a difference pops out: the use of the keyword &lt;code&gt;case&lt;/code&gt; to introduce an enum member in Swift. In one sense, this overloads that keyword, but in another sense it’s fine: pattern matching and enums go hand in hand, so the use in both cases is fairly natural. Rust doesn’t have any special syntax to designate the elements of an enum; they’re just separated by commas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am not at all shocked to find that Swift has a variant syntax for its unit type case declarations, where a single &lt;code&gt;case&lt;/code&gt; keyword precedes a list of comma-separated cases defined on a single line. (At this point, I would be more surprised &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to find a variant syntax for something in Swift!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something truly wonderful about both a Rust and Swift: enumerated types aren’t just wrappers around integer values. They’re real types of their own. This is powerful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rust and Swift also share in having enumerated types that can hold values. The most prominent of these so far in the Swift book are optionals, the &lt;code&gt;Optional&lt;/code&gt; enum type, corresponding very closely to Rust’s &lt;code&gt;Option&lt;/code&gt; type. Having had these for a bit in playing with Rust, and having gotten familiar with the utility of types like these while reading &lt;a href="https://gumroad.com/l/maybe-haskell"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maybe Haskell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—a delightful book which introduces Haskell and functional programming using Haskell’s &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt; type—I now miss them profoundly in languages which don’t have them. (Which is to say: every language I use on a regular basis professionally: C, C++, Python, JavaScript, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swift’s enum types don’t have integer values &lt;em&gt;by default&lt;/em&gt;—but they can have them if you define a type and assign a value to each enum case at the definition. These “raw values” are distinct from the “associated values” noted just above. I expect these exist primarily for ease of interoperation with Objective-C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;Rust doesn’t have anything like this, at least that I can think of. The main place it would be useful would be for foreign function interfaces (as in Swift), and this is one of several such gaps in Rust,&lt;/del&gt; along with the lack of a straightforward way to map to C’s &lt;code&gt;union&lt;/code&gt; types. &lt;del&gt;There are trade offs in terms of adding the functionality to the language, though, as it substantially increases the complexity of what an enum value can be, I think.&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; This was incorrect. From the &lt;a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference.html"&gt;Rust Reference&lt;/a&gt; section on &lt;a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference.html#enumerations"&gt;Enumerations&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enums have a discriminant. You can assign them explicitly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="rust"&gt;&lt;code&gt;enum Foo {
    Bar = 123,
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a discriminant isn’t assigned, they start at zero, and add one for each variant, in order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can cast an enum to get this value:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="rust"&gt;&lt;code&gt;let x = Foo::Bar as u32; // x is now 123u32&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This only works as long as none of the variants have data attached. If it were &lt;code&gt;Bar(i32)&lt;/code&gt;, this is disallowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initialization of Swift’s raw-valued enum type is quite similar, and pleasantly so, to Python’s initialization of enums.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a surprising change from the usual, Swift’s syntax for binding variable names when pattern matching against an enum is &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; verbose than Rust’s, requiring the use of either a leading &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; on the &lt;code&gt;case&lt;/code&gt; statement if all the elements are of the same type, or a &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; in front of each element otherwise:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="swift"&gt;&lt;code&gt;var matchedValue: String
let matchee = 3.14159
switch matchee {
case 3.14159:
    matchedValue = &amp;quot;pi&amp;quot;
case _:
    matchedValue = &amp;quot;not pi&amp;quot;
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Rust, a matched pattern can simply bind its value directly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="rust"&gt;&lt;code&gt;let matchee = 3.14159;
let matchedValue = match matchee {
    3.14159 =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;pi&amp;quot;.to_string(),
    _ =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;not pi&amp;quot;.to_string()
};&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swift has the ability to do recursive enumerations with its &lt;code&gt;indirect&lt;/code&gt; type. This is conceptually interesting, but off the top of my head I can’t think of a time when this would have been useful at any point since I started programming seven and a half years ago. The book’s example of a recursive function a aliasing arithmetic expressions is fine, but not particularly illuminating to me. I suspect, though, that it might make more sense if I were more familiar with pure functional programming paradigms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; a friend &lt;a href="https://alpha.app.net/jws/post/65990633"&gt;points out&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indirect enums are useful for recursive types in general. There are a lot of these: Lists, trees, and streams are the big ones that come to mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All those same lines: Rust does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; have the ability to have recursive enumerations at present (or recursive &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt; types, for that matter), at least without heap-allocating with &lt;code&gt;Box&lt;/code&gt; along the way. You &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; construct such a type, in other words, but you have to be explicit about how you’re handling the memory, and it can’t be stack-allocated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For an example of a recursive enumeration type (as well as an interesting/hilarious example of how you can easily confuse the compiler if you do this wrong), see &lt;a href="https://users.rust-lang.org/t/recursive-enum-types/2938"&gt;this Rust forum post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some discussion on stack- and heap-allocated memory in Rust, I’ll shamelessly promote my Rust podcast, &lt;a href="http://www.newrustacean.com"&gt;New Rustacean&lt;/a&gt;: take a listen to &lt;a href="http://www.newrustacean.com/show_notes/e005/index.html"&gt;e005: Allocate it where?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last year, I’ve worked on &lt;a href="//holybible.com"&gt;a site&lt;/a&gt; where small caps are important: setting the text of the Bible. In the Old Testament the name of God is transliterated as &lt;code&gt;Lord&lt;/code&gt; but in small caps—not “LORD” but &lt;span class="divine-name"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; (RSS readers will want to click through and see this on my site). However, the state of OpenType small caps support at the moment is… less than optimal. Safari (even up through Safari 9 on El Capitan, from which I am typing this) still doesn’t support the &lt;code&gt;-webkit-font-feature-settings: 'smcp'&lt;/code&gt; option, and a lot of the hits for this website will be coming from mobile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, “graceful degradation” is problematic here: if you specify both &lt;code&gt;font-variant: small-caps&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;font-feature-settings: 'smcp'&lt;/code&gt; in a browser that supports the latter (e.g. Chrome), the &lt;code&gt;font-variant&lt;/code&gt; declaration overrides it, so the horribly ugly old-style version still comes into play. (Note: this is as it should be per the &lt;a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css-fonts-3/#feature-precedence"&gt;spec&lt;/a&gt;: the &lt;code&gt;font-variant&lt;/code&gt; declaration has a higher priority than the &lt;code&gt;font-feature-settings&lt;/code&gt; declaration). Given the current implementations of &lt;code&gt;font-variant: small-caps&lt;/code&gt;, though—shrunken capitals rather than actual small capitals—the result is that using &lt;code&gt;font-variant: small-caps&lt;/code&gt; realists in not-so-gracefully degrading &lt;em&gt;everyone’s&lt;/em&gt; reading experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, I have exported the small caps as a distinct webfont and specified them directly; see &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/learning-qml-part-1.html"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; for a simple example: the first line of each paragraph is specified that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; do the same thing here (and at least in theory could deliver a pretty small typeface, since I really only need three characters: &lt;code&gt;o&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;d&lt;/code&gt;), I’d prefer simply to enable sane fallbacks. As noted above, however, that’s not possible. I am &lt;em&gt;open to&lt;/em&gt; but would very much prefer to avoid server-side solutions (browser detection, etc.) as a point of complexity that is better to minimize, especially given how rapidly browsers change. How else might one solve this problem, and especially are there existing solutions for it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the future, &lt;code&gt;font-variant: small-caps&lt;/code&gt; will handle this nicely, as per &lt;a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-fonts/#small-caps"&gt;the spec&lt;/a&gt; it should display a small-capitals-variant of the typeface if the typeface supplies it. However, at present, &lt;em&gt;no browser supports this&lt;/em&gt; (at least, none that I can find!). This means that instead, they all render fake small capitals simply by scaling down actual capitals. The result is typographically unpleasant, and unacceptable on this project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="the-solutions" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Solution(s)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent a considerable amount of time researching this and wrestling with it. After digging around as best I could, the top solutions for now are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="supports" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;code&gt;@supports&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take advantage of the &lt;code&gt;@supports&lt;/code&gt; rule in browsers. This is what I initially opted to do on this project.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; You use the rule this way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;.some-class {
    font-variant: small-caps;
}

@supports(font-feature-settings: &amp;#39;smcp&amp;#39;) {
    .some-class {
        font-variant: normal;
        font-feature-settings: &amp;#39;smcp&amp;#39;;
    }
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I’ve simplified by leaving out the prefixed versions; you’ll need to add the &lt;code&gt;-webkit-&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;-moz-&lt;/code&gt; prefixes to get this actually working.) This has the advantage that support for real small caps and support for the &lt;code&gt;@supports&lt;/code&gt; rule are very similar:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;@supports&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-featurequeries"&gt;Can I Use Feature Queries?&lt;/a&gt;: Chrome 31+, Firefox 29+, Opera 23+, Android 4.4+, Safari 9+, Edge 12+, Chrome for Android&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;font-feature-settings&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;a href="http://usabilitypost.com/2014/05/10/using-small-caps-and-text-figures-on-the-web/"&gt;Using Small Caps &amp;amp; Text Figures on the Web&lt;/a&gt;: Chrome, Firefox, IE10+&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t perfect: since IE10/11 don’t implement &lt;code&gt;@supports&lt;/code&gt;, you miss one browser—sort of. At this point, IE is a legacy browser, and Edge has had &lt;code&gt;@supports&lt;/code&gt; available from the start. Thus, this gets you most of the way there, and it should be future-facing: this should progressively enhance the site nicely. The normal (bad, but functional) small caps are displayed in the meantime, and when browsers eventually get around to using OpenType small caps by default for &lt;code&gt;font-variant: small-caps&lt;/code&gt;, this will continue to work just fine. It’s “progressive enhancement” and it’ll work nicely for most purposes.&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="typeface-subsetting" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Typeface subsetting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, one can create a subset of the typeface that includes only small capitals. This is what I have done for the small caps on this site; see the example in the first paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To pull this off, you’ll need to start by subsetting the typeface. You can do this manually with a font tool, or (the simpler way) you can use FontSquirrel’s custom subsetting tool in their &lt;a href="http://www.fontsquirrel.com/tools/webfont-generator"&gt;webfont generator&lt;/a&gt;. (&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; You &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; check the license and confirm that the typeface in question allows this kind of modification. See below.) In the web font generator, first upload the file you wish to modify. Then choose the &lt;strong&gt;Expert&lt;/strong&gt; radio button. Most of the settings you can leave as they are; they’re good sane defaults. Midway down the page you’ll see &lt;strong&gt;OpenType Flattening&lt;/strong&gt; options. Here, select only “Small Caps”. Run the generator. The result will be a complete replacement of the normal lowercase letters with the small caps set.&lt;a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that case, you can simply apply a style to the elements you want to have small capitals, e.g.:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;.divine-name {
    font-family: &amp;#39;my_typeface_smcp&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;my_typeface&amp;#39;, serif;
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major advantage to this approach is consistency: that typeface is going to display on every browser out there, back to IE5.5, as long as you deliver it correctly using the various hooks required by &lt;code&gt;@font-face&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few disadvantages to this approach, though:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It means delivering another font file. In my case, this would be an acceeptably low size (since I actually only need four characters), but it’s still something to consider in general. It is in any case another HTTP request, which is going to further slow the page load time or at least give you some flash of unstyled text when it reloads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may violate the licenses of the typefaces in question. For at least one of the fonts I used on this project, it &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt;: the license explicitly forbids rebuilding the font using tools like FontSquirrel. (FontSquirrel was the tool I used for this approach before, and it works quite well.) This is a make-or-break issue for using a subset of a typeface to accomplish the goal. That being said, if you have a good reason to do it, you may be able to get support from the vendor (especially if they’re a small shop). For the project that prompted this question, I was able to do just that with a nice email—the designer is a great guy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other major reason not to do it this way is that it has a significantly higher maintenance cost. If at any point you need to change or update the typeface, you have to go through the subsetting process all over again. By contrast, the first option will simply &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt;, though admittedly not as pleasantly as one might hope, and will not only continue to work but will actually improve over time as browsers increase their implementation of the CSS3 standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="conclusion" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I opted for the second solution on HolyBible.com—typography was one of the driving differentiators for the site, so I prioritized it and did the necessary legwork for it. In general, though, the first option should work well for most sites. In any case, both ways work, though the first one is a &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; example of progressive enhancement. And we can all look forward to the day when true small-caps support is available on every browser, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="refs" class="references"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section class="footnotes"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For various reasons (especially see note 2 below), I actually opted for the second approach outlined here, which is the same approach I was trying to avoid. Alas.&lt;a href="#fnref1"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Issues remain: even in the latest Chrome (46 as of the time of this post), using the &lt;code&gt;font-feature-settings: 'smcp'&lt;/code&gt; approach has some issues. For example, if you turn on &lt;code&gt;letter-spacing&lt;/code&gt; (a fairly common &lt;a href="http://practicaltypography.com/letterspacing.html"&gt;recommendation&lt;/a&gt; for small caps), the small caps will revert to normal lowercase letters.&lt;a href="#fnref2"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn3"&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the FontSquirrel blog post that introduced the feature:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a font with OpenType features, you can now flatten some of them into your webfont. For instance, some fonts have small caps built in, but they are completely inaccessible in a web browser. By selecting the “Small Cap” option, the Generator will replace all the lowercase glyphs with the small cap variants, giving you a small cap font. Please note that not all OpenType features are supported and if the font lacks OpenType features, using these options won’t create them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;a href="#fnref3"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;div id="refs" class="references"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chris Krycho</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 19 Oct 2015 08:27:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:www.chriskrycho.com,2015-10-19:2015/2015-10-19-0827.html</guid><category>music</category></item><item><title>Rust and Swift (viii)</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2015/rust-and-swift-viii.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i class="editorial"&gt;I am reading through the Swift book, and comparing it to Rust, which I have also been learning over the past few months. As with the other posts in this series, these are off-the-cuff impressions, which may be inaccurate in various ways. I’d be happy to hear feedback! Note, too, that my preferences are just that: preferences. Your tastes may differ from mine. &lt;a href="/rust-and-swift.html"&gt;(See all parts in the series.)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rust and Swift handle function definition fairly similarly, at least for basic function definitions. In fact, for most basic functions, the only difference between the two is the keyword used to indicate that you’re declaring a function: &lt;code&gt;fn&lt;/code&gt; in Rust and &lt;code&gt;func&lt;/code&gt; in Swift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Likewise, both return an empty tuple, &lt;code&gt;()&lt;/code&gt;, called the &lt;em&gt;unit type&lt;/em&gt; in Rust or &lt;code&gt;Void&lt;/code&gt; in Swift. Note, however, that this unit/&lt;code&gt;Void&lt;/code&gt; type is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; like C(++)’s &lt;code&gt;void&lt;/code&gt; or Java’s &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;: you cannot coerce other types to it; it really is an empty tuple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Type declarations on functions are basically identical for simple cases, though they vary into the details as you get into generics and constraints in generics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have no idea why the Swift team chooses to represent function names like this: &lt;code&gt;function_name(_:second_param:third_param:&amp;lt;etc.&amp;gt;)&lt;/code&gt;. Perhaps it’s a convention from other languages I’m simply unfamiliar with, but it seems both odd and unhelpful: eliding the first parameter name obscures important information. Also, why use colons for the delimiter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; I’m informed via Twitter and App.net that this reflects how function names work in Objective C, and derives ultimately from Smalltalk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being able to name the items in a returned type in Swift is quite handy; it’s something I have often wanted and had to work around with dictionaries or other similar types in Python.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ll see how I feel once I’ve been writing both for a while, but initially I &lt;em&gt;strongly&lt;/em&gt; prefer Rust’s more-obvious (if also somewhat longer) &lt;code&gt;-&amp;gt; Option&amp;lt;i32&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; to return an optional integer to Swift’s &lt;code&gt;-&amp;gt; Int?&lt;/code&gt;. I am quite confident that I’ll miss that trailing &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; somewhere along the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m sure there’s a reason for Swift’s internal and external parameter names and the rules about using &lt;code&gt;_&lt;/code&gt; to elide the need to use keyword arguments (but automatically eliding the first one) and so on… but I really can’t see the utility, overall. It seems like it would be better just to have Python-like args and keyword args.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s doubly so given that Swift’s rules for default-valued parameters map exactly to Python’s: they need to go at the end, after any parameters which don’t have default values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swift’s variadic parameters are nice—though of course limited, since if you have more than one, the compiler may not know how to resolve which destination parameter a given argument belongs with. (I imagine the compiler &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be extended to be able to handle multiple variadic parameters as long as hey we’re all of different types, but that’s probably not worth the work or the potential confusion it would introduce.) In any case, it’s a small nicety that I do wish Rust had.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swift’s variable parameters are… interesting. I can see the utility, sort of, but (probably from years of habit with C and Python and pass-by-reference types), it’s just not a pattern that makes a lot of sense to me right now. No doubt I’ll get used to them in idiomatic Swift, but while Rust doesn’t have a similar feature, I suspect I won’t miss it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In/out parameters—that is, mutable pass-by-reference types—are available in both languages. The syntax is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; different here, as are the semantics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swift has the &lt;code&gt;inout&lt;/code&gt; keyword, supplied before a parameter definition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="swift"&gt;&lt;code&gt;func adds4ToInput(inout num: Int) {
    num += 4;
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rust has instead a variation on every other type definition, declaring the type in this case to be a mutable reference:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="rust"&gt;&lt;code&gt;fn adds_4_to_input(num: &amp;amp;mut i32) {
    num += 4;
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual, in other words, Swift opts to use new syntax (in this case, a dedicated keyword) while Rust opts to use the same syntax used everywhere else to denote a mutable reference. In fairness to Swift, though, this is something of a necessity there. From what I’ve seen so far, Swift generally doesn’t (and perhaps can’t?) do pointers or references explicitly (though of course it’s handling lots of things that way under the covers); arguments to functions are a special case, presumably present primarily for interoperability with Objective-C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swift’s function type definitions, as used in e.g. function parameter definitions, are quite nice, and reminiscent of Haskell in the best way. Rust’s are pretty similar, and add in its &lt;code&gt;trait&lt;/code&gt; usage—because functions types &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;trait&lt;/code&gt;s. Once again, I really appreciate how Rust builds more complicated pieces of functionality on lower-level constructs in the language. (Swift may be doing similar under the covers, but the Swift book doesn’t say.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, though, the downside to Rust’s sophistication is that it sometimes bundles in some complexity. Returning a function in Swift is incredibly straightforward:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="swift"&gt;&lt;code&gt;func getDoubler() -&amp;gt; (Int) -&amp;gt; Int {
    func doubler(number: Int) -&amp;gt; Int {
        return number * 2
    }

    return doubler
}

func main() {
    let doubler = getDoubler()
    println(&amp;quot;\(doubler(14))&amp;quot;)  // -&amp;gt; 28
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing the same in Rust is a bit harder, because—as of the 1.3 stable/1.5 nightly timeframe—it requires you to explicitly heap-allocate the function. Swift just takes care of this for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="rust"&gt;&lt;code&gt;fn get_doubler() -&amp;gt; Box&amp;lt;Fn(i32) -&amp;gt; i32&amp;gt; {
    fn doubler(number: i32) -&amp;gt; i32 {
        number * 2
    }

    Box::new(doubler)
}

fn main() {
    let doubler = get_doubler();
    println!(&amp;quot;{:}&amp;quot;, doubler(14));  // -&amp;gt; 28
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you understand what’s going on under the covers here, this makes sense: Rust normally stack-allocates a function in a scope, and therefore the &lt;code&gt;doubler&lt;/code&gt; function goes out of scope entirely when the &lt;code&gt;get_doubler&lt;/code&gt; function returns if you don’t heap-allocate it with &lt;code&gt;Box::new&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In both languages, closures and “ordinary” functions are variations on the same underlying functionality (as it should be). In Rust’s case, functions and closures both implement the &lt;code&gt;Fn&lt;/code&gt; trait. In Swift’s case, named functions are a special case of closures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Swift syntax for a closure is, well, a bit odd to my eye. The basic form is like this (with the same “doubler” functionality as above):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="swift"&gt;&lt;code&gt;{ (n: Int) -&amp;gt; Int in return n * 2 }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For brevity, this can collapse down to the shorter form with types inferred from context, parentheses dropped and the &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; keyword inferred from the fact that the closure has only a single expression (note that this wouldn’t be valid unless in a context where the type of &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; could be inferred):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="swift"&gt;&lt;code&gt;{ n in n * 2 }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simplicity here is nice, reminiscent in a good way of closures/lambdas in other languages.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The fact that it’s a special case is less to my taste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rust’s closure syntax is fairly similar to Swift’s brief syntax. More importantly, there’s no special handling for closures’ final expressions. Remember: the final expression of &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; block is always returned in Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="rust"&gt;&lt;code&gt;|n| n * 2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we wanted to fully annotate the types, as in the first Swift example, it would be like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="rust"&gt;&lt;code&gt;|n: i32| -&amp;gt; i32 { n * 2 }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are even &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; differences between the two, because of Rust’s ownership notion and the associated need to think about whether a given closure is being borrowed or moved (if the latter, explicitly using the &lt;code&gt;move&lt;/code&gt; keyword).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swift has the notion of shorthand argument names for use with closures.&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The arguments to a closure get the default names &lt;code&gt;$0&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;$1&lt;/code&gt;, etc. This gets you even &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; brevity, and is quite convenient in cases where closures get used a lot (&lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;sort&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;fold&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;reduce&lt;/code&gt;, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="swift"&gt;&lt;code&gt;{ $0 * 2 }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If that weren’t enough, Swift will go so far as to simply reuse operators (which are special syntax for functions) as closures. So a closure call could simply be &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; for a function expecting a closure operating on two numbers; Swift will infer that it needs to map back to the relevant method definition on the appropriate type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The upside to this is that the code can be incredibly brief, and—once you’re used to it, at least—still fairly clear. The downside to this is yet &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; syntax for Swift, and the ever-growing list of things to remember and ways to write the same thing I expect will lead to quite a bit of instability as the community sorts out some expectations for what is idiomatic in any given instance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if that weren’t enough, there is more than one way to supply the body of a closure to a Swift function that expects it: you can supply a block (&lt;code&gt;{ /* closure body */ }&lt;/code&gt;) &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the function which expects it. Yes, this can end up looking nearly identical to the form for declaring a function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="swift"&gt;&lt;code&gt;someFunctionExpectingAnIntegerClosure() { n * 2 }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you can also drop the parentheses if that’s the only argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="swift"&gt;&lt;code&gt;someFunctionExpectingAnIntegerClosure { n * 2 }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of the &lt;em&gt;mechanics&lt;/em&gt; of closures, and not just the syntax, the one significant difference between Rust and Swift is the same one we’ve seen in general between the two languages: Swift handles the memory issues automatically; Rust makes you be explicit about ownership. That is, as noted above about the closures themselves, in Rust you may have to &lt;code&gt;move&lt;/code&gt; ownership to get the expected behavior. Both behave basically like closures in any other language, though; nothing surprising here. Both also automatically copy values, rather than using references, whever it makes sense to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swift autoclosures allow for lazy evaluation, which is neat, but: &lt;em&gt;yet more syntax&lt;/em&gt;! Seriously. But I think all its other closure syntaxes &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; allow for lazy evaluation. The only reason I can see to have the special attribute (&lt;code&gt;@autoclosure&lt;/code&gt;) here is because they added this syntax. And this syntax exists so that you can call functions which take closures as if they &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; take closures, but rather the argument the closure itself takes. But of course, this leads the Swift book to include the following warning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Overusing autoclosures can make your code hard to understand. The context and function name should make it clear that the evaluation is being deferred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, care needed indeed. (Or, perhaps, you could just avoid adding more special syntax that leads to unexpected behaviors?)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good grief. I’m tired now. That’s a half-dozen variants on &lt;em&gt;closure syntax&lt;/em&gt; in Swift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember: there’s still just one way to write and use a closure in Rust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This takes me back to something I noticed &lt;a href="/2015/rust-and-swift-ii.html"&gt;early on&lt;/a&gt; in my analysis of the two languages. In Swift, there’s nearly always more than one way to do things. In Rust, there’s usually one way to do things. Swift prefers brevity. Rust prefers to be explicit. In other words, Swift borrows more of its philosophy from Perl; Rust more from Python.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m a Python guy, through and through. Perl drives me crazy every time I try to learn it. You could guess (even if you hadn’t already seen) where this lands me between Rust and Swift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is incredibly long, but I blame that on the (frankly incredible) number of variants Swift has on the same concept.&lt;/p&gt;

In three weeks, I’ll run my seventh half marathon,&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and I finished my first triathlon last summer. So, yes, I do run a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s still a little strange to me. I came to running late, and in a roundabout way. Many of my friends ran cross country in high school; I played football (and poorly at that) instead. I ran off and on in college in a (mostly failing) attempt to stay in shape and avoid college weight. The only running I did consistently was playing Ultimate on Fridays with some friends. For the first year I was out of college, my routine was much the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then I got mono. I drank after a friend who carries around a particularly virulent strain of it, and was down for the count: a month in bed, and two months of recovery after that. I was, in theory, the captain of a church league Ultimate team that spring. I missed half the games, and even when I was able to attend some of them in the latter half of the season, it left me literally needing a nap just to stand and watch for an hour. In the hopes of being back in good enough shape to play the following fall, I started running as soon as I was cleared by the doctor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That first run on a treadmill in May 2010 was painfully slow. Even when I was furthest out of shape before that, running an 8-minute mile had been doable—painful, perhaps, but doable. That day I ran a 12-minute mile, and was done for the day. The same thing another day that week. And again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But slowly, over time, I built up my endurance. I managed to run two miles outside a few weeks later. By the time Ultimate season rolled around in late August, I could run five miles, and was doing three to five miles four times a week. I was in good enough shape to play Ultimate, and I enjoyed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, I found running hard, and didn’t particularly enjoy it. I ran solely as a means to the end of playing Ultimate. More, five miles was my upper limit if I ran hard (as I always did). When I thought about people who ran half-marathons—still less the full—I simply could not understand how they did it. But I started to &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then I had one simple conversation, which changed my entire approach to running. It set me on a course to this seventh half-marathon, and to being “that runner guy” around here. It led to my being the healthiest I’ve ever been. And, strangest of all, it ended up with my &lt;em&gt;loving&lt;/em&gt; to run—and not because I like pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But more on that next time.&lt;/p&gt;

</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chris Krycho</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 30 Sep 2015 06:29:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:www.chriskrycho.com,2015-09-30:2015/2015-09-30-0629.html</guid><category>family</category><category>kate</category></item><item><title>A Range of Prophets</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2015/a-range-of-prophets.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;N. T. Wright makes it painfully clear that it’s difficult (if not impossible) to understand Jesus fully and rightly without having a deep knowledge of the Old Testament:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equally impressive are the strong hints, throughout the gospels, that Jesus was modelling his ministry not on one figure alone, but on a range of prophets from the Old Testament. Particularly striking is his evocation of the great lonely figure Micaiah ben Imlach (1 Kings 22), who, when asked about the coming battle, predicted the death of Ahab, king of Israel, by saying, ‘I saw all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no sheperd.’ Jesus, looking at the crowds, takes pity on them, because that is what they remind him of: leaderless sheep. Like Ezekiel, Jesus predicts that the temple will be abandoned by the Shekinah, left unprotected to its fate. Like Jeremiah, Jesus constantly runs the risk of being called a traitor to Israel’s national apsirations, while claiming all the time that he nevertheless is the true spokesman for the covenant god. This, as we shall see, lies behind a good part of the story of Jesus’ action in the Temple, and his subsequence ‘trial’: Jesus has predicted the destruction of the Temple and is on trial not least as a false prophet. Jesus replies to earlier critics and questioners with the sign of the prophet Jonah. Jonah was predicting immenent judgment on Nineveh, following his adventure with the fish; Jesus is predicting imminent judgment on Israel, and a similar sign will validate his message too. He is constantly redefining what the coming day will mean for Israel, warning her, like Amos, that it will be a day of darkness, not of light. Like Amos, too, he implies that the people of god are to be judged as the climax of the divine judgment upon all nations. The judgment which he announces upon Israel is sketched with the help of prophetic passages relating to the judgment of Jerusalem by Babylon, and also, more terrifyingly, passages which speak of the divine judgment upon Babylon itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above all, Jesus adopts the style of, and consciously seems to imitate, Elijah. Here we are again in an interesting position &lt;em&gt;vis-à-vis&lt;/em&gt; the sources. It is clear from all three synoptics that they, and presumably with them the early church as a whole, regard John the Baptist as in some sense Elijah &lt;em&gt;redivivus&lt;/em&gt;. They nevertheless portray Jesus as acting in Elijah-like ways, and show that the disciples were thinking of Elijah-typology as giving them a blueprint for his, and their own, activity. Jesus himself, explaining the nature of his work, is portrayed using both Elijah and Elisha as models. Again, it is highly unlikely that the early church, seeing Jesus as the Messiah and hence John as Elija, created this identification out of nothing. However, at the same time, though John himself seems to have thought that Jesus was to be the new Elijah, Jesus actually returned the compliment. We begin here to see both parallel and distinction. Jesus’ ministry is so like that of Elijah that they can be easily confused. He too is announcing to the faithless people of &lt;span class="divine-name tetragrammaton"&gt;YHWH&lt;/span&gt; that their covenant god will come to them in wrath. But at the same time he is also acting out a different message, one of celebration and inauguration, which bursts the mould of the Elijah-model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From all of this it should be clear that Jesus regarded his ministry as in continuity with, and bringing to a climax, the work of the great prophets of the Old Testament, culminating in John the Baptist, whose initiative he had used as his launching-pad.&lt;/p&gt;

As is, all you’re doing is propping up some of the nastiest, most anti-consumer companies in the country and sustaining monopolies and duopolies, supposedly in the name of “free markets”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;N.b. This isn’t intrinsically a partisan issue. It’s become one, but mostly because Republicans have felt compelled to do the bidding of the telecom industry for… reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing worse than a government monopoly is a &lt;em&gt;private&lt;/em&gt; monopoly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Republicans wanted to push for &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local-loop_unbundling"&gt;local loop unbundling&lt;/a&gt; in place of net neutrality, &lt;em&gt;almost everyone&lt;/em&gt; would be for it. (The exception: telecom companies.)&lt;/p&gt;

As with the other posts in this series, these are off-the-cuff impressions, which may be inaccurate in various ways. I’d be happy to hear feedback! Note, too, that my preferences are just that: preferences. Your tastes may differ from mine. &lt;a href="/rust-and-swift.html"&gt;(See all parts in the series.)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Rust and Swift have &lt;em&gt;pattern-matching&lt;/em&gt;, and with what appears to be fairly similar basic behavior. (I touched on this briefly in my &lt;a href="/2015/rust-and-swift-i.html"&gt;first post in the series&lt;/a&gt;.) In Rust this goes under the &lt;code&gt;match&lt;/code&gt; construct, with matches specified like &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;pattern&amp;gt; =&amp;gt; &amp;lt;expression|statement&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, optionally with guards specified with &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; expressions. In Swift, patterns are matched using the &lt;code&gt;switch&lt;/code&gt; construct, with matches specified like &lt;code&gt;case &amp;lt;pattern&amp;gt;: &amp;lt;expression|statement&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, optionally with guards specified with &lt;code&gt;where&lt;/code&gt; expressions. (&lt;code&gt;where&lt;/code&gt; is also used in Rust, but for generic constraints, not pattern match guards.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both languages allow you to bind names to a matched pattern: Swift with &lt;code&gt;case let &amp;lt;name&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and Rust simply by using the name in a normal destructuring expression as part of the match definition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; that’s not &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; right. In Rust, you use the &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt; operator with the variable name you want to bind in the match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit the second:&lt;/strong&gt; I was mixed up, because Rust actually has &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; of those options. You can either match directly, e.g. when getting the value of an &lt;code&gt;Option&lt;/code&gt; type: &lt;code&gt;Some(value)&lt;/code&gt; as the pattern will bind &lt;code&gt;value&lt;/code&gt;. But if you need to bind a specific part of more complicated data structure, the &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt; operator is present to let you do it in a fairly straightforward way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both languages allow for the use of &lt;code&gt;_&lt;/code&gt; as a “wildcard” in match definitions. Since match definitions in Rust use the patterns directly, the equivalent of Swift’s C-like &lt;code&gt;default&lt;/code&gt; is simply a wildcard match pattern (&lt;code&gt;_ =&amp;gt; &amp;lt;-expression|statement&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;One significant difference: like its &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; blocks, Rust’s &lt;code&gt;match&lt;/code&gt; blocks are expressions, so they can be assigned. I.e., you can write this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="rust"&gt;&lt;code&gt;let test = 5u32;
let description = match test {
    0..10 =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;less than ten&amp;quot;,
        _ =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;greater than ten&amp;quot;,
}
println!(&amp;quot;{?:}&amp;quot;);  // &amp;quot;less than ten&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swift doesn’t let you do this; the same thing there would be written like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="swift"&gt;&lt;code&gt;let test: UInt32 = 5
var description: String
switch test {
    case 0..&amp;lt;10:
        description = &amp;quot;less than ten&amp;quot;
    default:
        description = &amp;quot;greater than ten&amp;quot;
}
println(&amp;quot;\(description)&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both languages have &lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt; statements, but in Rust they’re only used in loop constructs, while Swift (like C) uses them to escape &lt;code&gt;case&lt;/code&gt;s as well. The Swift book gives an example of one place they’re necessary in a &lt;code&gt;switch&lt;/code&gt;: to match a case and do nothing there (e.g. &lt;code&gt;default: break&lt;/code&gt;). In Rust, you would simply supply an empty block for that scenario (e.g. &lt;code&gt;_ =&amp;gt; {}&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Correctly, both languages force you to match exhaustively on relevant patterns. If you’re matching an enumerated type, for example, you must handle every enumerated value. You can of course do this with wildcard patterns or with Swift’s &lt;code&gt;default&lt;/code&gt;, but the good thing is that both languages will refuse even to compile if a given pattern isn’t matched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swift’s default behavior around its &lt;code&gt;switch&lt;/code&gt; statements is sane: it does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; automatically fall through into the next statement. It does let you do this, without checking the condition on the next statement (as in C), using the &lt;code&gt;fallthrough&lt;/code&gt; keyword. Rust, by contrast, simply doesn’t allow this at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both languages supply named control statements (loops, etc.), with slightly different syntax for naming them. Rust’s, curiously, shares its syntax with lifetime definitions—more on those in a future post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t believe Rust has anything quite like Swift’s &lt;code&gt;guard&lt;/code&gt;s, which allow you to leave normal or expected control flow in the main body of a block, with a secondary block for cases where the &lt;code&gt;guard&lt;/code&gt; isn’t matched. This isn’t a huge deal, but it does fit as a nice convenience into the typical &lt;code&gt;if let&lt;/code&gt; pattern in Swift. Basically, it just lets you elide an empty &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; block and supply only the &lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt; block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; a friend &lt;a href="https://alpha.app.net/jws/post/64804111"&gt;points out&lt;/a&gt; that Swift &lt;code&gt;guard&lt;/code&gt;s also require you to exit the current scope, so it’s unambiguous what you’re doing if you use them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Note, too, that my preferences are just that: preferences. Your tastes may differ from mine. &lt;a href="/rust-and-swift.html"&gt;(See all parts in the series.)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It kind of feels like this summarizes a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of things about the overall design of Swift:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the two forms are functionally identical, the shorthand form is preferred and is used throughout this guide when referring to the type of an array. —&lt;em&gt;The Swift Programming Language (Swift 2 Prerelease)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The documentation for the various types in Rust’s &lt;code&gt;std::collections&lt;/code&gt; module is hilarious and great. Highly recommended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that jumped out at me reading this chapter of the Swift book (though I don’t think it’s been explicitly discussed yet): Rust doesn’t have named parameters; Swift does. There are good reasons for that in both cases, but I suspect this is one of the small details I’ll miss the most in Rust. I’ve been spoiled by Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swift’s &lt;code&gt;Array&lt;/code&gt; type is analogous to Rust’s &lt;code&gt;Vec&lt;/code&gt; type (usually created with the &lt;code&gt;vec!&lt;/code&gt; macro), &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; its &lt;code&gt;Array&lt;/code&gt; type. Rust &lt;code&gt;Vec&lt;/code&gt;s and Swift &lt;code&gt;Array&lt;/code&gt;s are dynamically sized and created on the heap, whereas Rust’s &lt;code&gt;Array&lt;/code&gt;s are statically sized and created on the stack. Syntax for creating &lt;code&gt;Array&lt;/code&gt;s in both languages is quite similar (though the results are different):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Swift:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed size: &lt;code&gt;let an_array: [Int] = [1, 2, 3]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Variable size: &lt;code&gt;var an_array = [1, 2, 3]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rust:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Array: &lt;code&gt;let an_array: [i32, 3] = [1, 2, 3];&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vector: &lt;code&gt;let a_vector: Vec&amp;lt;i32&amp;gt; = vec![1, 2, 3];&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s the long form, of course; both languages have type inference, so you’d rarely write it like that. The usual form would be with the type in all of those cases:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Swift:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed size: &lt;code&gt;let an_array = [1, 2, 3]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Variable size: &lt;code&gt;var an_array = [1, 2, 3]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rust:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Array: &lt;code&gt;let an_array = [1, 2, 3];&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vector: &lt;code&gt;let a_vector = vec![1, 2, 3];&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rust also adds the concept of “slices,” which provide access to segments of arrays, and are heap-allocated as pointers to a given item in the array and a length (number of elements) included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Array&lt;/code&gt; operations in Swift are all pretty reasonable, and surprisingly descriptive. They remind me in a good way of Python’s &lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt; methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/vec/struct.Vec.html"&gt;ways to interact with &lt;code&gt;Vec&lt;/code&gt;s in Rust&lt;/a&gt;. (That’s not a bad thing.) A bit surprising to me was the absence of an &lt;code&gt;enumerate&lt;/code&gt; method, on &lt;code&gt;Vec&lt;/code&gt; itself, but then I discovered that it exists in the &lt;code&gt;IntoIter&lt;/code&gt; struct in the same module, which fully implements the &lt;code&gt;Iterator&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;trait&lt;/code&gt;. As a result, it has an &lt;code&gt;enumerate&lt;/code&gt; function returning an &lt;code&gt;Enumerate&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt; instance. (Under the covers, I suspect Swift &lt;code&gt;Array&lt;/code&gt;s just implement an &lt;code&gt;Iterable&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;protocol&lt;/code&gt;, which is similar to this approach in some ways.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes a point I’m coming back to fairly often: Rust doesn’t necessarily put everything on a single object definition, but rather into a set of related &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;enum&lt;/code&gt; types and &lt;code&gt;trait&lt;/code&gt;s. This is really powerful, but it’s going to take some mental adjustment. In this way, Swift’s structure and semantics are much more like the languages I’m used to than Rust’s are (but even there, the use of &lt;code&gt;protocols&lt;/code&gt; gives it considerable new flexibility).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that I said &lt;em&gt;semantics&lt;/em&gt;, not syntax. Swift and Rust are a great example of how very similar syntax can mask differences in semantics. (For another such example, compare JavaScript’s syntax and semantics to Java’s: they’re superficially similar syntactically, and light years apart semantically.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swift’s &lt;code&gt;Set&lt;/code&gt; type and Rust’s roughly analogous &lt;code&gt;HashSet&lt;/code&gt; both have a &lt;code&gt;contains&lt;/code&gt; method which behaves much like Python’s &lt;code&gt;in&lt;/code&gt; keyword. Indeed, and perhaps unsurprisingly, the two types implement many of the same methods in general. This is perhaps to be expected given that the language around sets (as a mathematical concept being mapped down into a representation in a program) is quite standardized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of their stricter typing systems, both Rust and Swift require you to specify the types used in their mapping constructs (Rust has &lt;code&gt;HashMap&lt;/code&gt; and Swift has &lt;code&gt;Dictionary&lt;/code&gt;), though of course both can infer this as well in certain cases. At the most basic level, you can’t use arbitrary (hashable) types as keys in mixed fashion like you can in e.g. Python’s &lt;code&gt;dict&lt;/code&gt; type, but in practice this shouldn’t matter, for two reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s generally inadvisable to use different types for keys in the same dictionary anyway. To me, at least, that usually indicates the need to step back and think more carefully about the types and data structures I’m using.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the occasional case where it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; appropriate, I wonder if you could declare the type as generic in either Rust or Swift. I’m putting this down as a TODO item for myself to find out!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really wish that Swift used the Python-style curly-brace delimited syntax (&lt;code&gt;{'key': 'value'}&lt;/code&gt;) for its dictionary literal initializers. I can see, from a syntax reason, why it doesn’t: that would overload the block syntax (which Python can avoid because it’s white-space delimited). But it’s &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; convenient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along similar lines, I can see why the Swift designers chose to make all iterables have literal initializers using braces (&lt;code&gt;[...]&lt;/code&gt;); it makes parsing fairly straightforward. However, the result is that it’s pretty difficult to see at first glance what you’re dealing with. It could quite easily be an &lt;code&gt;Array&lt;/code&gt;, a &lt;code&gt;Set&lt;/code&gt;, or a &lt;code&gt;Dictionary&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This highlights a too-little-appreciated aspect of programming language design: &lt;em&gt;readability&lt;/em&gt;. However much we programmers enjoy writing code, the reality is that we will all spend a great deal of our time—probably even a majority of it—reading it instead. Thus, while we should care about conveniences for writing code, and being overly verbose can be a pain, we should also concern ourselves with the ease of comprehending code when it is read, and the syntax and conventions a language embraces are a big part of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Dictionary&lt;/code&gt; type in Swift is a pretty close analog to Python’s &lt;code&gt;dict&lt;/code&gt;, right down to several of the method names. the same is true of Rust’s &lt;code&gt;HashMap&lt;/code&gt;. That’s not a bad thing by any stretch of the imagination.&lt;/p&gt;

As with the other posts in this series, these are off-the-cuff impressions, which may be inaccurate in various ways. I’d be happy to hear feedback! Note, too, that my preferences are just that: preferences. Your tastes may differ from mine. &lt;a href="/rust-and-swift.html"&gt;(See all parts in the series.)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been working on learning Swift over the past couple weeks, and had spent the month prior to that doing a deep first dive on Rust. This kind of approach, learning two languages basically at the same time, is entirely new to me, and for good reason. Programming languages are not trivial to learn, and to learn them meaningfully one must practice with them a great deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m doing this largely of necessity. I’m hoping to build an application with a very capable, performant cross-platform core language (Rust), but planning to ship a native OS X app (first) when all is said and done. My desire to make the core libraries portable rules out Swift immediately. To be frank, so does the fact that it’s an Apple language: I am happy to use Apple’s tools on its platform, but I don’t want to shackle myself to their choices in the long run. Too, having good Rust experience is likely to be valuable in many other contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I need to learn both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, while I wouldn’t ordinarily recommend this course of action—indeed, unless you already have a fair bit of programming experience and already know several languages, I’d actively recommend against it—I’m finding it enormously profitable. The languages have been designed in roughly the same time frame, cite many of the same influences, and overlap substantially in terms of audience and goals. Yet they are, as this series has already highlighted, quite different languages in many ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning them in parallel is helping me see the trade-offs each one has made, and force me to think about &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; they differ in the ways they do. In particular, I think I have a much better idea what’s going on “under the covers” in each language and therefore know what to expect of them better. This, in turn, has dramatically deepened my grasp of the languages relative to the amount I’ve been looking at them, compared to previous language-learning efforts. (It also helps that I’ve already learned a number of languages, of course, and that I’ve been pushing my brain into the learning-programming-languages space via reading about Haskell, functional patterns in JavaScript, and so on this year.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a long way to go in both languages, of course. Reading on nights and weekends, and the little bit of playing I’ve been able to do with each of them, is no replacement for just sinking my teeth into a project and finding the pain points. Nonetheless, I’m really glad to be learning these two languages &lt;em&gt;together&lt;/em&gt;. If you’re up for a challenge, try it sometime! You’ll be surprised how much you learn.&lt;/p&gt;

It gives you a great deal of expressitivity in the language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s contrast with Python (which I love, for the record). In Python, you can do something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;some_condition = True
if some_condition:
    a_value = &amp;quot;Yeah!&amp;quot;
else:
    a_value = &amp;quot;Oh, sads.&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those are &lt;em&gt;statements&lt;/em&gt; in the body of the &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt; block; you can’t assign the block itself to &lt;code&gt;a_value&lt;/code&gt;. However, like C, C++, Java, etc., Python does provide an &lt;em&gt;expression&lt;/em&gt;-type conditional, a ternary expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you can also do this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;some_condition = True
a_value = &amp;quot;Yeah&amp;quot; if some_condition else &amp;quot;Oh, sads.&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This expression form of the &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; block is what all Rust &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; blocks are. So in Rust, the normal long form is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="rust"&gt;&lt;code&gt;let some_condition = true;
let a_value = if some_condition {
    &amp;quot;Yeah!&amp;quot;
}
else {
    &amp;quot;Oh, sads.&amp;quot;
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(You could also write this with a &lt;code&gt;let mut a_value&lt;/code&gt; and then set its value inside the conditional blocks, but that’s not at all good form in Rust.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course, you can shorten that rather nicely where the expressions are brief enough:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="rust"&gt;&lt;code&gt;let some_condition = true;
let a_value = if some_condition { &amp;quot;Yeah!&amp;quot; } else { &amp;quot;Oh, sads.&amp;quot; }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this gets really nice when you have more complicated work to do in a Rust conditional. It doesn’t matter how many things going on inside an &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; expression; it’s still an expression. As such, you can also write this:&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="rust"&gt;&lt;code&gt;let some_condition = true;
let a_value = if some_condition {
    let the_answer = 42;
    let theme = &amp;quot;Take my love, take my land...&amp;quot;;
    &amp;quot;Yeah!&amp;quot;  // An expression!
}
else {
    let the_question = &amp;quot;What do you get when you multiply six by nine?&amp;quot;;
    let song = &amp;quot;You can&amp;#39;t take the sky from me!&amp;quot;;
    &amp;quot;Oh, sads.&amp;quot;  // An expression!
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously this is totally contrived and silly; the point is that no matter what the internals are, &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; blocks are expressions, and their final expressions can be assigned like any other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a note: I got here because I was originally thinking you couldn’t do a one-liner like you can in Python. As shown above, that’s totally false, and in fact the Rust version is much more capable than Python’s, because you don’t need a dedicated ternary when all &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; blocks are expressions. Rust used to have a C-style ternary (&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;condition&amp;gt; ? &amp;lt;value if true&amp;gt; : &amp;lt;value if false&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;) but it was &lt;a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/1698"&gt;removed&lt;/a&gt; during the lead-up to the 1.0 release—a decision I wholeheartedly affirm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;section class="footnotes"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that under normal conditions the compiler won’t actually accept this because of the unused names.&lt;a href="#fnref1"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

I want to be writing longer-form, narrative poetry, and this has a &lt;em&gt;little&lt;/em&gt; more of that than what I have been doing lately. I need to start using constraining forms (and especially historical forms) once more: that makes for richer, better poetry from me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is significant: we learn how to do certain kinds of creative work (perhaps all creative work!) by closely following the forms and approaches of those who preceded us. This is just as true of composing music as of poetry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An aside: the fact that the final words of the first and third, and second and fourth stanzas of that poem are the is a total coincidence. There is a greater degree of serendipity in art—or at least, in my art—than would boost my ego to let on. But ego-boosting be damned.&lt;/p&gt;

As with the other posts in this series, these are off-the-cuff impressions, which may be inaccurate in various ways. I’d be happy to hear feedback! Note, too, that my preferences are just that: preferences. Your tastes may differ from mine. &lt;a href="/rust-and-swift.html"&gt;(See all parts in the series.)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Swift and Rust directly address the issue of having to worry about memory allocation and safety. They do it in different ways, though: Swift by automatic reference counting, Rust by its concept of ownership. For a lot of day-to-day development, I can see the Swift approach being a win for the same reason a language like Python or Ruby is: having that all handled for you is &lt;em&gt;nice&lt;/em&gt;. Having the power Rust gives you comes at the price of increased cognitive load from having to reason about ownership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put it another way: all programming languages have to make trade offs. Although I like Rust’s better than Swift’s so far, I’ve no doubt I will find any number of things to appreciate about Swift over Rust. You can’t have everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This caught my attention in part because dealing with things like strings (or other pass-by-value types) in Swift is rather more straightforward than in Rust. The outcomes are much the same, but since &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;s in Swift are passed by value (never by reference), you simply don’t have to think about modification—even safe modification!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rust of course had the &lt;code&gt;Copy&lt;/code&gt; trait which lets you do this, but the point is that the “ergonomics” are slightly nicer in Swift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, the string interpolation Swift does is &lt;em&gt;nice&lt;/em&gt;. That’s one thing I really wish Rust had. It’s Python-style string formatting macro is great, but being able to interpolate values (&lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;strings with \(variables)&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; or even &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;embedded expressions like \(2 + 4)&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;) is very nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swift’s approach to strings in general seems well-thought-through and gives appropriate levels of attention to the details which make handling complex or non-Western languages much more manageable. As a typography geek, I appreciate this a great deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, since Swift’s strings &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; handle all those edge cases for Unicode, you lose some standard string access patterns and lose much (maybe all?) insight into the internal structure of the string. That may be good, and may be bad, depending on the circumstance. Like I said: trade-offs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, on reading further, the way Swift handles Unicode strings is pretty nice. It &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; give you insight into those, via specific methods for different representations. I particularly appreciate that it’s you deal with them as the standalone &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; type as well as giving you direct access to the code points—and not just one Unicode code point set, but any of &lt;abbr&gt;UTF8&lt;/abbr&gt;, &lt;abbr&gt;UTF16&lt;/abbr&gt;, or &lt;abbr&gt;UTF32&lt;/abbr&gt; (Unicode scalars). Trust Apple to pay close attention to text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rust’s strings are &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;, but not quite as sophisticated (presumably for simplicity around the memory mapping). All Rust &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;str&lt;/code&gt; instances are composed of &lt;abbr&gt;UTF32&lt;/abbr&gt; Unicode scalars, encoded as &lt;abbr&gt;UTF8&lt;/abbr&gt; sequences. It doesn’t have some of the convenience methods Swift does for getting any of the other representations. That said, I expect this should show up rarely if at all in my ordinary usage. Importantly, the fundamental storage is the same: both use scalars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the first section where it didn’t feel like Rust was just a clear overall “winner” over Swift. Some of the trade offs between the language designs are more apparent here, and I do appreciate the “ergonomics” of Swift in a number of these things.&lt;/p&gt;

Azurdia III spent several decades preaching and pastoring. He was thus well-experienced in the week-to-week work of preparing sermons and the burden of caring for a congregation. During his years of pastoral work, however, he also studied at Westminster Theological Seminary; he was at the time of the book’s publication a professor at Western Seminary. Thus, he also brought to the table academic knowledge helpful for situating his developing understanding of the role of the Holy Spirit in a preaching ministry. Accordingly, Azurdia brings both Scripture and experience to bear in &lt;em&gt;Spirit Empowered Preaching&lt;/em&gt;: the lessons he learned in seminary, he then applied in the context of his ongoing ministry, and was able to filter his experience through careful reflection on the Scriptures. &lt;em&gt;Spirit Empowered Preaching&lt;/em&gt; was published not at the beginning of that career, but after considerable time behind the pulpit of an ordinary church, after he had moved into a teaching role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Azurdia’s aim in &lt;em&gt;Spirit Empowered Preaching&lt;/em&gt; is twofold: to demonstrate the necessity of the Holy Spirit’s work in the preacher for effective preaching, and to describe how the preacher should go about seeking the Spirit’s work in his preaching. He argues in his introduction that “the greatest deficiency in contemporary expositional ministry is powerlessness; in other words, preaching that is devoid of the vitality of the Holy Spirit” (12). That is, although right preaching necessarily entails careful exegesis and attention to the “literal, grammatical, historical, contextual, redemptive” details of a text (11), no amount of mere intellectual study on its own will accomplish God’s purposes for preaching. If the church is to be encouraged, challenged, and built up; and if outsiders are to be convicted, the Holy Spirit must be present and working efficaciously through the preacher. Only the Spirit can change human hearts. This was true for the early church, and it is true today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Azurdia lays out his thesis in a brief introduction. Following that, he does not simply repeat the thesis chapter by chapter, however. Instead, he builds a broader theology of preaching and connects the different elements of the preaching ministry back to the central theme of the text. Thus, in Chapter 1, he starts by arguing that the “greater works” the disciples would do were the advancement of the gospel through the nations, and notes how Christ explicitly tied this to the coming of the promised Holy Spirit. The advance of the gospel was for the disciples, and is for modern preachers, utterly dependent on the work of God. Chapter 2 describes who the Spirit is and what he does in the life of the minister—and what goes wrong in the ministry when the Spirit is neglected. In Chapter 3, Azurdia argues for Christocentric preaching, since the Spirit is &lt;em&gt;Christ’s&lt;/em&gt; Spirit and glorifies him. Chapter 4 carries this theme further: the priority of every preacher must be glorifying Christ, not merely meeting the felt needs of the people. Every topic must be heard in light of the finished work of the Savior, not standing on its own as abstract ethical instruction. In Chapter 5, he argues that the first responsibility of both the minister and the church is preaching—and that, as such, the church should understand when the pastor spends most of his time preparing for sermon delivery, rather than on other concerns. Here he also takes time to critique ministry methodologies which do not align with the gospel, especially those in many seeker-sensitive churches which have run to extremes of entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Chapter 6, Azurdia comes to the core of his message: the preacher must be both generally filled with the Spirit (i.e. regenerate) and specifically filled time and again by the Spirit for preaching. Here he draws upon the frequent language of being “filled with the Holy Spirit” in Acts as well as the affirmations of preachers like Martyn Lloyd Jones. Chapter 7 is an examination of the flip-side of the necessity of the Spirit’s filling: the frustration of the pastor’s own inability. If the work of the Spirit is utterly essential for preaching to have any effect whatsoever, then all the pastor’s efforts may be for naught. This may lead to either despair (for the self-dependent man) or greater faith (for the man who trusts Christ).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Chapter 8, Azurdia turns to the nature and life of a man called to this ministry: he “&lt;em&gt;must devote himself to a consistent pattern of fervent intercession&lt;/em&gt;” (135, emphasis original). That the Spirit must be present for preaching to be effective is not grounds for pastors to abdicate their own responsibility. Rather, it increases their responsibility to pray for the Spirit to work through their preaching. Chapter 9 continues this focus on the life of the preacher. He must be prayerful, diligent in study, and prayerful in his study. He must remember in all this prayer that the Spirit is not a &lt;em&gt;tool&lt;/em&gt; but a &lt;em&gt;person&lt;/em&gt;, someone who can be grieved. The preacher must keep himself holy, and so must his congregation—because either may drive away the Spirit by their unrepentance. Chapter 10 illustrates and emphasizes this necessity of prayer in the life of both preacher and congregation. Finally, Azurdia briefly summarizes his argument: “&lt;em&gt;Spirit empowered preaching is the principle means of advancing the kingdom of God…. will be evangelical in emphasis…. is the responsibility of the church&lt;/em&gt;” (179–181, emphasis original).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is persuasive and thorough, but neither as effective or as persuasive as it might have been. Azurdia’s comments on the “greater ministry” the disciples were to have are perhaps the most helpful material in the book. In general, his attention to the roles the Spirit plays in the life of the church is a helpful corrective both to the neglect the Spirit often receives from non-charismatic churches and the misinterpretations proffered by many in the charismatic movement. Likewise, his call to prayerful as well as well-studied preaching is a helpful reminder especially for preachers tempted to rely on their own intellectual merits. Gladly, and unlike E. M. Bounds’ work on prayer, he does so without ever denigrating the value of intellectual engagement and deep study. Azurdia’s counsel to study hard, pray hard, and pray during the time of study is well-taken. Those who preach should devote meaningful parts of their preparation time not only to exegesis but to fellowship with God by &lt;em&gt;prayerful&lt;/em&gt; interaction with the text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the greatest strength of the book is Azurdia’s emphasis on the nature and person of the Spirit. As noted above, he refuses to indulge in the mistaken charismatic emphases on the miraculous gifts over the more central work of the Spirit: revealing Christ. All the focus on sign gifts can quickly lead people to forget that the Spirit was sent to make Christ known and glorify him. His diagnostic question is extremely helpful (and not only for evaluating charismatics, but for evaluating anyone claiming God’s hand on his ministry): “&lt;em&gt;Does this ministry reveal and glorify Jesus Christ?&lt;/em&gt;” (50, emphasis original). Again, the Spirit is the spirit of truth, sent by the Father to empower the church to know and make known the Son. As such, no ministry which claims the Spirit’s power but focuses on anything other than knowing and proclaiming Christ is legitimate. At the same time, this does not mean the church should shun the Spirit to avoid those missteps—rather, the church should point to a better understanding of the Spirit’s mission, and respond in faith. A church that understands the Spirit’s proclamatory and instructing role will follow Azurdia’s counsel and dedicate itself to prayer, cognizant that apart from the Spirit the church and her pastor can do nothing. Congregations should also learn to ask that same question of &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; sermons and preachers and experiences: does it reveal and glorify Jesus Christ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, weaknesses emerge in a number of areas which substantially lessen the book’s impact. First, Azurdia makes the same move many Reformed and evangelical preachers do, elevating the preaching of the word to the primary (and nearly the sole) responsibility of the preacher. This move seems unwarranted in light of the distinction between ordinary pastors and the apostles on whose actions (in Acts 6) the view is grounded. As such, Azurdia simply passed over the many other responsibilities enjoined of shepherds in the pastoral epistles. To be sure, preaching is a necessity in the life of the church. However, it is only one of the pastor’s responsibilities, and he will find it difficult to carry it out effectively if he is not sharing life with his sheep. Thus, pastors ought to dedicate much of their time to &lt;em&gt;shepherding&lt;/em&gt;: to caring for the ordinary soulish needs of their people and not only for the times of preaching. This is doctrinally necessary, and practically helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More problematic was Azurdia’s conflation of the Spirit’s filling with an experience or sense of that filling. Like Lloyd-Jones and others he cites, Azurdia describes the anointing or unction of the Spirit as a particular sense the preacher and congregation have of the Spirit’s working through him in a unique way. Curiously, Azurdia also affirms that there may be times the Spirit is moving powerfully but the preacher is unaware of it, as in the common case of a man who preached and felt it accomplished nothing but heard later from members of his congregation how the Spirit used it in their lives. Too often in evangelicalism, &lt;em&gt;feeling&lt;/em&gt; is mistaken for &lt;em&gt;reality&lt;/em&gt;. Nowhere in the New Testament is the Spirit’s presence described in terms of a feeling in the preacher. Rather, it is born out by the effects of the preaching. To be sure, the Spirit may graciously grant the pastor a clear sense of his presence and power on some days, and that sense is a blessing. However, the absence of such a sense does not indicate the Spirit’s absence; neither does a strong feeling necessarily indicate his presence in power. In encouraging pastors to think in these terms, Azurdia ultimately plants seeds of discouragement in the lives of those who may preach diligently and prayerfully—and effectively—for many years without that particular experience, which is promised no one. As he notes of many experiences in charismatic circles, “we need to be concerned that the spiritual development of well-meaning Christians can become vulnerable to the law of diminishing returns… Often, the inevitable consequence is spiritual emptiness” (49). This is no less a danger for the preacher expecting a strong internal sense of anointing than for the believer wanting a fresh anointing for speaking in tongues. Preachers should indeed dedicate themselves to prayer and come with an expectation that they can accomplish nothing on their own, but they should reject as unbiblical and unhelpful the idea that their internal sense of the Spirit’s presence is accurate or indicative of his work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, on the whole, Azurdia’s point is well-taken. The church desperately needs the Holy Spirit for her efficacy in ministry. Lives will not change unless God works: sermons will fall on deaf ears, and congregations’ ministries may produce physically helpful outcomes while leaving sinners damned. Preachers and their people must recover prayerful dependence on the third person of the Trinity. They must ask constantly of their ministries, “Does this show Christ clearly and make him look glorious?” They must plead for the Spirit to come and work. But (contra Azurdia) they must never mistake their perceived experience of the Spirit for the actual work of the Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

As with the other posts in this series, these are off-the-cuff impressions, which may be inaccurate in various ways. I’d be happy to hear feedback! Note, too, that my preferences are just that: preferences. Your tastes may differ from mine. &lt;a href="/rust-and-swift.html"&gt;(See all parts in the series.)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just hit operators in the Swift book. First question: are operators special syntax, or are they sugar for &lt;code&gt;protocol&lt;/code&gt;s? (Every modern language I use or even have played with handles them as sugar for another language construct—Python, Ruby, Io, Elixir, and Rust, to name just a few ranging over a substantial variety of ages and styles.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh. I did the requisite digging, and operators are functions (which is okay) defined in the &lt;del&gt;global namespace (&lt;em&gt;:sigh:&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/del&gt; Swift module.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I say “okay” rather than good because the justification offered is that this is the only way to make the operators work as binary operators between existing instances of types. But that elides the fact that, if that’s the case, it is so because of other language design decisions. This seems like a perfect place to use a &lt;code&gt;protocol&lt;/code&gt;, but perhaps (unlike Rust’s &lt;code&gt;trait&lt;/code&gt;) they’re not sufficiently capable to handle this? That’s an open question; I have no idea about the answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, Rust has several fewer operators than Swift, even apart from those mentioned in my &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2015/rust-and-swift-ii.html"&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;. It drops the pre- and post-increment operators entirely (as does Python), since their results can always be accomplished in other ways with less potential for confusion. Swift keeps them, no doubt in part because most (Objective) C programs are deeply familiar with them and with idioms associated with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned a few new things about Rust’s operators as well: the Boolean &lt;code&gt;||&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; operators and its bitwise &lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; operators differ not only in that the former are &lt;em&gt;short-circuit&lt;/em&gt; operators and the latter are not. Obviously you can also do things like bit-wise flag operations with the latter, but the reference emphasizes the short-circuiting behavior. This makes perfect sense, but it wasn’t something I’d ever considered explicitly before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no ternary operator in Rust, because of how it handles the relationship between expressions and statements. Swift keeps it. That’s an interesting reflection of differences in design: Rust dropped it because &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; blocks are expressions, so it’s redundant, and they have had a goal of removing unnecessary features. (See the discussion on dropping the ternary operator—with an interesting aside from Brendan Eich on JavaScript—&lt;a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/1698"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Note that this is not a criticism of Swift, just an observation, though I do really like Rust’s expression-driven approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;??&lt;/code&gt; “nil coalescing operator”, on the other hand, I actively dislike. This seems like shorthand for the sake of shorthand, partly necessitated by the existing drive toward shorthand with optional types in Swift. Sometimes brevity can lead to decreased clarity. Eliding too much, or subsuming it into shorthand, makes the language harder to hold in your head and requires you to slow down more for parsing each line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing surprising (or different) between the standard boolean operators in the two languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder how many times the word “concise” (or synonyms of it) appear in the Swift book? It’s increasingly clear to me reading that brevity is one of the primary design goals. Maybe it’s just me, but that actually seems a little weird. Brevity is good so far as it goes, but &lt;em&gt;legibility&lt;/em&gt; is much better.&lt;/p&gt;

Note, too, that my preferences are just that: preferences. Your tastes may differ from mine. &lt;a href="/rust-and-swift.html"&gt;(See all parts in the series.)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first blush, I find the extra syntax around optionals in Swift more confusing than helpful. I think this comes down to my preference for a more Python-like approach: “Explicit is better than implicit” and “There should be one– and preferably only one –obvious way to do it” both militate against the multiple different ways you can handle optional values in Swift. &lt;code&gt;Optional&lt;/code&gt; types are created in one of two ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;with the &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; operator on a type definition, creating an explicitly wrapped type which must be checked in some way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;with the &lt;code&gt;!&lt;/code&gt; operator on a type definition, creating an “implicitly unwrapped optional” by forcibly unwrapping it (and creating a runtime error if the optional is empty)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After creating an optional, you can get at its contents by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;using the &lt;code&gt;if let&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;while let&lt;/code&gt; constructs to bind the optional value’s non-&lt;code&gt;nil&lt;/code&gt; value for a block&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;using the &lt;code&gt;!&lt;/code&gt; operator on a variable name, explicitly unwrapping it (and creating a runtime error if the optional is empty)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contrast, in Rust you always have to explicitly unwrap the item, using the &lt;code&gt;unwrap&lt;/code&gt; method or pattern matching. There are no implicitly unwrapped types. Moreover, there is no special syntax around creating optional types in Rust: you just declare them with an &lt;code&gt;Option&lt;/code&gt; type or another type that &lt;code&gt;impl&lt;/code&gt;s the &lt;code&gt;Option&lt;/code&gt; behavior. The “shortcut” behavior around error handling, &lt;code&gt;try!&lt;/code&gt;, isn’t special syntax, but application of another standard language construct (in this case, a macro).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discussion of &lt;code&gt;assert&lt;/code&gt; in the Swift book re-raises the question about the global namespace:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You write an assertion by calling the global &lt;code&gt;assert(_:_:)&lt;/code&gt; function.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This continues to suggest strongly that Swift does in fact have a true global namespace, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; an automatically-imported prelude. That can make a big difference for applications in certain spaces (e.g. systems programming), when you might have good reason to want to replace the standard library’s approach with a different one. (See Rust’s &lt;a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/no-stdlib.html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;#[no_std]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; docs and the &lt;a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1184-stabilize-no_std.md"&gt;related RFC&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; “strongly suggests” or no, I have now been &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jckarter/status/708765262309228544" title="Tweet by one of the Swift developers"&gt;reliably informed&lt;/a&gt; that I was mistaken—and am happy to have been wrong here. As in Haskell, these functions are implicitly imported and belong to the &lt;code&gt;Swift&lt;/code&gt; module.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Rust, &lt;code&gt;assert!&lt;/code&gt; is a macro, not a function, which is an interesting but perhaps not &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; important distinction in this particular case. (It might be, though; I’d have to see the implementation of each to see how they play out differently.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, this also highlights another large difference between the two: testing is &lt;a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/testing.html"&gt;front and center&lt;/a&gt; in Rust, and barely receives a mention so far in the Swift book (and isn’t in the table of contents). Having language-level support for testing is a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Language tour and first chapter of the language guide down, my sense is that Swift is a substantially better language than C or C++ (and presumably than Objective C, but since I don’t know that language I can’t speak to it) for app design, but that Rust is a better language yet. Both a far more modern than their predecessors, but they approach the same problems in surprisingly different ways, relatively similar syntax notwithstanding. So far, I like the Rust approach better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, more syntax is not my preferred way to tackle these things. Providing good language constructs and primitives on which to build seems better in &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It substantially reduces the cognitive load for the developer, by keeping the number of constructs small and simply varying how they are applied.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It increases the quality of those primitives, because it forces the language deadness to make sure they actually address the full problem space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It lets developers approach the same problem in ways the language design team may not have anticipated, and over time the community may find shared conventions that improve on the &lt;code&gt;std&lt;/code&gt; approach, and nothing has to change in the language spec (or the compiler!) to adopt those changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In general, then, it makes change much easier to manage, and change can be community-driven rather than requiring the language design team to manage it.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

I realized after a bit that it would make a better blog post than chat room content, so here we are. This is all entirely off-the-cuff: me just thinking out loud as I read; this is by no means expert opinion.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i class=editorial&gt;I later turned this into the first part of a whole &lt;a href="/rust-and-swift.html"&gt;series&lt;/a&gt; comparing Rust and Swift!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;..&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt; – seriously?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That has to be one of the most annoying operators I’ve ever seen. It ends up with cognitive noise because &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;name&lt;/code&gt; initially processes as “starting a generic” and you have to re-parse it visually and mentally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the first chapter of the Swift book, my impression is “a poor man’s Rust”; my gut feel based on that first pass and everything I’ve seen and read about Swift over the past two years is that it’s roughly what you would get if you took Rust’s syntax and replaced Rust’s hard safety goals with the aim of mapping to ObjC semantics. (To be fair to Apple, that interoperability was probably necessary.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;An example that jumps out at me as immediately illustrative of the difference in approach the languages take is the way you pass structures by reference vs. copy. In Swift, that’s done via two completely distinct language constructs, &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt;s and &lt;code&gt;class&lt;/code&gt;es respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Rust, there is just the &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt; type to handle both of those. They’re immutable unless you declare them with &lt;code&gt;mut&lt;/code&gt;, and you can pass them via copy simply by implementing the &lt;code&gt;Copy&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;trait&lt;/code&gt; (which seems roughly analogous to Swift’s &lt;code&gt;protocol&lt;/code&gt;, but I’ve not yet dig deeply enough to see how they differ). Those things aren’t baked into the language, but use simpler language building blocks to define behavior into he library.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I saw someone do a write up a while back arguing that Go isn’t a &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; language, it just isn’t a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; language. My first impression of Swift, after having spent the last month with Rust, is very much along those lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huh. Here’s something that I appreciate about Rust, Haskell, and others now that I didn’t before: there’s a difference between implicitly/automatically importing a prelude or a given set of standard library functions, and having actually global functions. Does Swift actually have functions like &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt; in a global namespace, as the book seems to imply, or they being imported automatically &lt;em&gt;a la&lt;/em&gt; Rust/Haskell/etc.?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; it appears Swift does likewise, but that you can’t access the relevant module directly. Which is halfway there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hmm. Why have &lt;code&gt;Double&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;Float&lt;/code&gt;—just for ObjC interop, I guess?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; follow-up from a conversation with a friend: it’s because you have 32- and 64-bit architectures out there; sometimes you don’t want 64 bits of floating point precision for that reason. Note that Rust &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; has this distinction; you can declare things as &lt;code&gt;f32&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;f64&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extending the above note on &lt;code&gt;class&lt;/code&gt;es and &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt;s and &lt;code&gt;protocol&lt;/code&gt;s vs. Rust’s approach: the same thing is true about &lt;code&gt;extension&lt;/code&gt;, which is a distinct concept from implementing a &lt;code&gt;protocol&lt;/code&gt;; again, in Rust these are both just handled with a single language construct, &lt;code&gt;impl&lt;/code&gt;. That’s not because &lt;code&gt;impl&lt;/code&gt; is overloaded, but rather because the underlying language machinery is the same for the two things. (edited)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;(I’ve a feeling learning Swift is going to turn me into even more of a Rust fanboy.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reading the two books in close sequence like this is proving really productive mentally for thinking about how the two handle the same issues. I’ve never done anything quite like this before, and it’s fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have an increased appreciation for Rust’s use of semi-colons to turn expressions into statements, and thereby to distinguish clearly between the two (among other things, allowing for implicit return of anything that’s an expression).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another interesting comparison: Rust’s &lt;code&gt;match&lt;/code&gt; and Swift’s &lt;code&gt;switch&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;case&lt;/code&gt; fill the same role of pattern matching. I’m curious to see how they differ. Does Swift do matching on arbitrary expressions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I see where the syntax choices came from in both, and while I slightly prefer Rust’s, I think both make reasonably good sense; Swift’s will understandably be more familiar to C and ObjC programmers, and that’s a perfectly defensible approach. Seen that way, it is expanding on the C-style construct (even if it’s actually doing something substantially more sophisticated than that under the hood by being a form of actual pattern matching).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

While he’s &lt;a href="http://text-patterns.thenewatlantis.com/2015/08/podcasts-redux.html"&gt;since acknowledged&lt;/a&gt; that part of his challenge with podcasts is that his bar is extremely high, I think his original piece bears quoting and responding to briefly, including a few thoughts about how Stephen and I handle &lt;a href="http://www.winningslowly.org"&gt;Winning Slowly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From his piece:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Podcasts, overall, are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;People struggling to articulate for you stuff you could find out by looking it up on Wikipedia (e.g. In Our Time);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;People using old-timey radio tricks to fool you into thinking that a boring and inconsequential story is fascinating (e.g. Serial);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;People leveraging their celebrity in a given field as permission to ramble incoherently about whatever happens to come to their minds (e.g. The Talk Show); or&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;People using pointless audio-production tricks to make a pedestrian story seem cutting-edge (e.g. Radiolab).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually happen to basically agree with those critiques. However, one category he left out is: &lt;em&gt;people podcasting the way people blog&lt;/em&gt;. And this is where many of the most interesting podcasts I listen to come in. It’s also basically where Winning Slowly fits: you can think of our show like an audio version of a blog post. It’s not as carefully considered or edited as a long-form magazine piece (or, in its respective medium, a professionally produced radio show). But like blog posts, the fact that it’s a bit more off the cuff and that it’s &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the incredibly tight work that you find in a magazine can actually be attractive at times. Many of my favorite podcasts are very conversational and not heavily produced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But—and here I think Jacobs is absolutely correct—all of the shows I really enjoy make a point to edit their shows. They clean up the audio from artifacts, they cut segments that were off topic, they make sure the levels are good between the different members of the podcast, and so on. And while you don’t have to do those things to have a podcast, any more than you need to edit the things you write to have a blog, you do need to do them if you want to have a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; show. Sadly, this is where a number of shows I otherwise might enjoy show themselves to the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a reason Stephen and I spent a whole &lt;a href="http://www.winningslowly.org/season-0.html"&gt;“beta” season&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://www.winningslowly.org"&gt;Winning Slowly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; working not only on what we wanted the show to be about, but finding its voice and tone, the structure of the episodes, and the quality of our audio. We wrestled with the audio output from mediocre microphones and adopted seemingly silly practices like putting blankets over our heads and microphones and laptops while recording so that we can get better sound spaces. We have taken the time to learn about compression and limiting and other audio editing techniques, and work hard to get the mix between our intro and outro music and our own voices correct. And we cut things mercilessly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, here is the blooper reel from &lt;a href="http://www.winningslowly.org/3.05/"&gt;3.05&lt;/a&gt;, which consists of only the &lt;em&gt;funny&lt;/em&gt; parts of what I cut from the show (there was probably as much again that I just removed and didn’t include):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;audio class="media-embed" title="3.05 Bloopers" controls preload="metadata"&gt;
&lt;source src="http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.m4a/cdn.winningslowly.org/3.05-bloopers.m4a"&gt; &lt;source src="http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/cdn.winningslowly.org/3.05-bloopers.mp3"&gt;
&lt;/audio&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That doesn’t begin to touch all the “umms” and long pauses and overly heavy breathing and do-overs we cut out (though, because this was a particularly rough episode, it does give you an idea). The result, as I think most of our listeners would agree, is a show that’s pretty tight as far as the audio goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of content, different shows will have a different feel, of course. Some will require more planning. &lt;a href="http://www.newrustacean.com/"&gt;New Rustacean&lt;/a&gt;, a new show on learning Rust I’m hoping to launch later this week or early next week, requires a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of planning. &lt;a href="http://www.sap-py.com/"&gt;Sap.py&lt;/a&gt;, the fun little show my wife and I are about to launch, about her adventures in learning Python, requires basically &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; planning. Winning Slowly doesn’t require a lot of formal planning, but it does require Stephen and me to keep a good eye on ongoing stories in our fields of technology, religion, ethics, and art, and to discuss big-picture ideas regularly and actively. Some episodes, we outline carefully (like the one we recorded today, which will come out next Tuesday). For others, we can basically just wing it (like the one we recorded a week ago and which comes out tomorrow). But if our podcast is good, and I really do think it is, it is because we take the time to work at making it good. Just like you have to do on a blog, or really anything else in life.&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="refs" class="references"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;section class="footnotes"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;13 published episodes, and one we dropped entirely!&lt;a href="#fnref1"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One big difference between a podcast and a blog is that it actually takes a lot &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; work to make a good podcast than a good blog post. Audio editing is much more involved than editing writing, and speaking intelligently for any length of time—whether off the cuff, with a detailed outline, or as an interviewer—is much harder to get right than writing, where you can polish to your heart’s content.&lt;a href="#fnref2"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

One is whether something has manual memory management or is garbage collected, reference counted, or otherwise manages memory itself. This is what people often mean when they talk about C, C++, etc. as being “low-level” and languages like Python or Ruby or C♯ being high-level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then you toss in a language like &lt;a href="https://www.rust-lang.org"&gt;Rust&lt;/a&gt;, and things start to get a little more complicated. Rust can do the same kind of direct memory management that makes C or C++ a good language for things like writing operating system kernels. [&lt;a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture_of_Windows_NT"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="http://www.opensource.apple.com/source/xnu/xnu-2782.10.72/"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;] But it is also memory-safe, at least in ordinary usage. Like C♯, you have to be explicit about any unsafe code, with the &lt;code&gt;unsafe&lt;/code&gt; keyword on any blocks that do memory management that isn’t safe. And the vast majority of Rust code &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than that, though, Rust &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; like a high-level language. It gives you higher-kinded functions, generics, traits-based composition of types, hygienic macros, and the implementation of many important parts the essentials of the language in the library. If you need to patch something, or extend something, you can do that in a straightforward way. In short, it gives you lots of good abstractions like you would expect in a high-level language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rust is low-level in that you can write (and people are writing) systems-level programs in it. It is high-level in that it lets you express things in ways normally associated with languages like Haskell or OCaml or Python or Ruby. To put it simply: it’s &lt;em&gt;low-level&lt;/em&gt; in its ability to address the computer, and &lt;em&gt;high-level&lt;/em&gt; in the abstractions it hands to a programmer. That’s a powerful combination, and I hope more languages embrace it in the years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve been writing all of my papers in Markdown ever since I got here, and haven’t regretted any part of that… except that managing references and footnotes has been painful at times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Footnotes in Markdown look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="markdown"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Here is some text.[^fn]

[^fn]: And the footnote!&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This poses no problems at all for normal footnotes. Academic writing introduces a few wrinkles, though, which means that this has always been the main pain point of my use of Markdown for writing papers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many academic citation styles (including the Chicago Manual of Style, on which our seminary’s &lt;a href="http://www.press.uchicago.edu/books/turabian/turabian_citationguide.html"&gt;style guide&lt;/a&gt; is based) tend to have a long version of the footnote appear first, followed by short versions later. Nearly &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; academic citations styles make free use of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibid."&gt;“ibid.”&lt;/a&gt; abbreviation for repeated references to save space, time, and energy. Here is how that might look in manually-written footnotes, citing the very paper in which I sorted this all out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="markdown"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Some text in which I cite an author.[^fn1]

More text. Another citation.[^fn2]

What is this? Yet *another* citation?[^fn3]

[^fn1]: So Chris Krycho, &amp;quot;Not Exactly a Millennium,&amp;quot; chriskrycho.com, July 22,
    2015, http://www.chriskrycho.com/2015/not-exactly-a-millennium.html
    (accessed July 25, 2015), ¶6.

[^fn2]: Contra Krycho, ¶15, who has everything *quite* wrong.

[^fn3]: ibid.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seems straightforward enough, though it is a bit of work to get the format right for each different kind of citation (articles, books, ebooks, electronic references to articles…). Things &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; get complicated in the editing process, though. For example, what if I needed to flip the order of some of these notes because it became clear that the paragraphs needed to move around? This happens &lt;em&gt;frequently&lt;/em&gt; during the editorial process. It becomes particularly painful when dealing with the “ibid.”-type references, because if I insert a new reference between two existing references, I have to go back in and manually add all that the reference content again myself.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter Pandoc and &lt;span class="tex"&gt;BibT&lt;span class="texE"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;X&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="managing-citations" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Managing Citations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of plain-text solutions to academic writing is not especially new; only the application of Markdown to it is—and that, only relatively. People have been doing this, and &lt;a href="http://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2014/01/23/plain-text/"&gt;documenting their approaches&lt;/a&gt;, for quite a while. Moreover, tools for managing references and citations have existed for quite some time as well; the entire &lt;a href="http://www.latex-project.org"&gt;L&lt;span class="texA"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;T&lt;span class="texE"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;X&lt;/a&gt; toolchain is largely driven by the concerns of academic publishing, and as such there are tools in the &lt;span class="tex"&gt;L&lt;span class="texA"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;T&lt;span class="texE"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;X&lt;/span&gt; ecosystem which address many of these problems.&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One such is &lt;span class="tex"&gt;BibT&lt;span class="texE"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;X&lt;/span&gt;, and the later (more capable) &lt;span class="tex"&gt;BibL&lt;span class="texA"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;T&lt;span class="texE"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;X&lt;/span&gt;: tools for managing bibliographies in &lt;span class="tex"&gt;L&lt;span class="texA"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;T&lt;span class="texE"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;X&lt;/span&gt; documents. The &lt;span class="tex"&gt;BibT&lt;span class="texE"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;X&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="tex"&gt;BibL&lt;span class="texA"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;T&lt;span class="texE"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;X&lt;/span&gt; approach to managing citations in a document is the use of the &lt;code&gt;\cite&lt;/code&gt; command, with the use of “keys” which map to specific documents: &lt;code&gt;\cite{krycho:2015aa}&lt;/code&gt;, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not Markdown, of course. But other folks who have an interest in Markdown and academic writing have put their minds to the problem already. Folks such as Jon MacFarlane, the originator and lead developer of &lt;a href="http://pandoc.org"&gt;Pandoc&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps the single most capable text-conversion tool in existence. As it turns out, Pandoc Markdown supports a &lt;a href="http://pandoc.org/README.html#citations"&gt;citation extension&lt;/a&gt; to the basic markup. It’s just a variant on the &lt;span class="tex"&gt;BibT&lt;span class="texE"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;X&lt;/span&gt; citation style that feels more at home in Markdown: a pair of braces and an &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt;, plus the citation key, like &lt;code&gt;[@krycho]&lt;/code&gt;. Moreover, Pandoc knows how to use &lt;span class="tex"&gt;BibT&lt;span class="texE"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;X&lt;/span&gt; libraries, as well as many others, and &lt;a href="http://citationstyles.org"&gt;Citation Style Languages&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;abbr&gt;CSL&lt;/abbr&gt;s) to generate markup in &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; the format needed for any given citation style.&lt;a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of writing out all those citations details by hand, then, I can just format my footnotes like this (assuming the citekey I had set up for the article was &lt;code&gt;krycho:revelation:2015&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="markdown"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Some text in which I cite an author.[^fn1]

More text. Another citation.[^fn2]

What is this? Yet *another* citation?[^fn3]

[^fn1]: [@krycho:revelation:2015], ¶6.

[^fn2]: Contra [@krycho:revelation:2015], ¶15, who has everything *quite* wrong.

[^fn3]: [@krycho:revelation:2015].&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is much simpler and, importantly, has the exact same form for each citation. Pandoc will take care of making sure that the first reference is in the long form, later references are in the short form, and repeated references are in the “ibid.” form as appropriate. It even renders a properly sorted and structured Works Cited section.&lt;a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The slightly complex command I used to generate a Word document from a Markdown file with citations (using my own &lt;span class="tex"&gt;BibT&lt;span class="texE"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;X&lt;/span&gt; library and the Chicago Manual of Style &lt;abbr&gt;CSL&lt;/abbr&gt;) on the command line is:&lt;a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="bash"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ pandoc revelation.md --smart --standalone \
--bibliography /Users/chris/Dropbox/writing/library.bib \
--csl=/Users/chris/Dropbox/writing/chicago.csl -o revelation.docx&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see an extended sample of this kind of usage in practice, take a look at the &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2015/not-exactly-a-millennium.txt"&gt;Markdown source&lt;/a&gt; for the paper I wrote last week, using exactly this approach. Every footnote that references a specific source simply has a cite key of this variety. The header metadata includes a path to the bibliography file and a &lt;abbr&gt;CSL&lt;/abbr&gt;. (These could be configured globally, as well, but I chose to specify them on a per-file basis so that if I want or need to use &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; styles or a separate library for another file at a later time, I can do so with a minimum of fuss. More on this below.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/downloads/revelation.docx"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is the rendered result. You can see that it automatically generated everything right down to the “ibid.”-style footnotes. I made a few, fairly minimal tweaks (replacing the search &lt;abbr&gt;URL&lt;/abbr&gt; with an &lt;abbr&gt;ATLA&lt;/abbr&gt; database catalog reference and inserting a section break before the Works Cited list), and turned the paper in—confident, for the first time since I started seminary, that all of the references were in the right order and the right format. With carefully formatted reference documents (with their own style sets),&lt;a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I was able to generate an actually &lt;em&gt;nice&lt;/em&gt; &lt;abbr&gt;&lt;a href="/downloads/revelation-pretty.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/abbr&gt; version of the paper from another Word document, as well.&lt;a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, better yet, you don’t even have to put citations in footnotes. As &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/anjdunning"&gt;@anjdunning&lt;/a&gt; pointed out in a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/anjdunning/status/625415216575197184"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; response to the original version of this post:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.twitter.com/chriskrycho"&gt;@chriskrycho&lt;/a&gt; Don’t put citekeys in a footnote: write everything as inline citations and it will also generate notes when asked by CSL def.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/anjdunning/status/625415216575197184"&gt;∞&lt;/a&gt; July 26, 2015 17:19&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my standard example from above, then, you could simply do this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="markdown"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Some text in which I cite an author.[@krycho:revelation:2015, ¶6]

More text. Another citation.[Contra @krycho:revelation:2015, ¶15, who has
everything *quite* wrong.]

What is this? Yet *another* citation?[@krycho:revelation:2015]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will generate the same markup for my purposes here; and as &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/anjdunning"&gt;@anjdunning&lt;/a&gt; noted, it goes one step further and does what’s appropriate for the &lt;abbr&gt;CSL&lt;/abbr&gt;. This might be handy if, for example, you wanted to use the Chicago notes-bibliography style in one format, but switch to a simpler parenthetical citation style for a different medium—or even if you had a paper to submit to different journals with different standards. Having the citations inline thus has many advantages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, there are still times when you might want to split those out into distinct footnotes, of course. That second one is a good candidate, at least for the way I tend to structure my plain-text source. I find it useful in the case of &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; footnote content—i.e. text that I’m intentionally leaving aside from the main text, even with reference to other authors—to split it out from the main flow of the paragraph, so that someone reading the plain text source gets a similar effect to someone reading the web or Word or &lt;abbr&gt;PDF&lt;/abbr&gt; versions, with the text removed from the flow of thought. In any case, it’s quite nice that Pandoc has the power and flexibility such that you don’t &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, you don’t actually &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; the brackets around the citekey, depending on how you’re using the reference. If you wanted to cite the relevant author inline, you can—and it will properly display both the inline name and a reference (footnote, parenthetical, etc.) in line with the &lt;abbr&gt;CSL&lt;/abbr&gt; you’ve chosen. If I were going to quote myself in a paper, I would do something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="markdown"&gt;&lt;code&gt;As @krycho:revelation:2015 comments:

&amp;gt; This was a hard paper to write.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; powerful, and while I didn’t take advantage of it in my first paper using these tools, you can bet I will be in every future paper I write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="all-those-references" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;All those references&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, as is probably apparent, managing a &lt;span class="tex"&gt;BibT&lt;span class="texE"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;X&lt;/span&gt; library by hand is no joke. Entries tend to look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="tex"&gt;&lt;code&gt;@book{beale:revelation:2015,
        Date-Added = {2015-07-20 21:16:02 +0000},
        Date-Modified = {2015-07-20 21:21:05 +0000},
        Editor = {G. K. Beale and David H. Campbell},
        Publisher = {William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company},
        Title = {Revelation: A Shorter Commentary},
        Year = {2015}}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there is a lot of utility in having that data available in text, on disk, no one wants to &lt;em&gt;edit&lt;/em&gt; that by hand.&lt;a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Gladly, editing it by hand is not necessary. For this project, I used the freely available &lt;a href="http://bibdesk.sourceforge.net"&gt;BibDesk&lt;/a&gt; tool, which is a workable (albeit not very pretty and not &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; capable) manager for &lt;span class="tex"&gt;BibT&lt;span class="texE"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;X&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="//cdn.chriskrycho.com/images/bibdesk.png" title="Not very pretty, but it does work" alt="BibDesk – open to the library for my Revelation paper" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;BibDesk – open to the library for my Revelation paper&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I filled in the details for each item and set a citekey for it, I was ready to go: BibDesk just stores the files in a standard &lt;code&gt;.bib&lt;/code&gt; file on the disk, which I specified per the Pandoc command above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BibDesk gets the job done alright, but only alright. Using a citation and reference management tool was a big win, though, and I fully intend to use one for every remaining project while in seminary—and, quite possibly, for other projects as well. Whether that tool is BibDesk or something else is a different matter entirely. (More on this below.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="to-the-web" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;To the web!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted something more out of this process, if I could get it. One of the reasons I use plain text as a source is because from it, I can generate Word documents, &lt;abbr&gt;PDF&lt;/abbr&gt;s, and &lt;em&gt;this website&lt;/em&gt; with equal ease. However, Python Markdown knows nothing of &lt;span class="tex"&gt;BibT&lt;span class="texE"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;X&lt;/span&gt; or citekeys, to my knowledge—and since I render everything for school with Pandoc, I have long wanted to configure &lt;a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.6.0/"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt; to use Pandoc as its Markdown engine instead of Python Markdown anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it happens, I actually set this up about a month ago. The process was pretty simple:&lt;a href="#fn9" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref9"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I installed the &lt;a href="https://github.com/jstvz/pelican-pandoc-reader"&gt;pandoc-reader&lt;/a&gt; Pelican extension.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I set the plugin path in my Pelican configuration file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I specified the arguments to Pelican I wanted to use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only additional tweaks necessary to get citation support were calling it with the &lt;code&gt;'--filter pandoc-citeproc'&lt;/code&gt; arguments, which lets it process any bibliography data supplied in the header metadata for the files. Calling Pandoc with &lt;code&gt;--bibliography &amp;lt;path to bibliography&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; (as in my example above) is a &lt;a href="http://pandoc.org/README.html#citation-rendering"&gt;shortcut&lt;/a&gt; for calling it with &lt;code&gt;--metadata &amp;lt;path to bibliography&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the &lt;code&gt;--filter pandoc-citeproc&lt;/code&gt; arguments. I could just supply the bibliography directly in the call from Pelican, but this would limit me to using a single bibliography file for &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of my posts—something I’d rather not limit myself to, since it might make sense to build up bibliographies around specific subjects, or even to have smaller bibliographies associated with each project (exported from the main bibliography), which could then be freely available along with the contents of the paper itself.&lt;a href="#fn10" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref10"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (On this idea, see a bit more below under &lt;strong&gt;The Future&lt;/strong&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One word of warning: Pandoc is much slower to generate &lt;abbr&gt;HTML&lt;/abbr&gt; with &lt;code&gt;--filter pandoc-citeproc&lt;/code&gt; than &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; the filter, and the larger your site, the more you will feel this. (The time to generate the site from scratch jumped from about 10s to about 30s for me, with 270 articles, 17 drafts, 2 pages, and 1 hidden page, according to Pelican.) Pandoc has to process &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; article to check for citations, and that’s no small task. However, if you have Pelican’s content caching turned on, this is a one-time event. After that, it will only be processing any new content with it; total generation time is back down where it was before for me: the effort is all in generating the large indexes I use to display the content for the landing pages and for category and tag archives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the result: that same paper, rendered to &lt;abbr&gt;HTML&lt;/abbr&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2015/not-exactly-a-millennium.html"&gt;on my website&lt;/a&gt;, with citations and works cited, generated automatically and beautifully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="other-site-generators" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Other site generators&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know the situation around using Pandoc itself in other generators, including Jekyll—I simply haven’t looked. I do know, however, that there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; some tooling for Jekyll specifically to allow a similar workflow. If you’re using Jekyll, it looks like your best bet is to check out &lt;a href="https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar"&gt;jekyll-scholar&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://github.com/inukshuk/citeproc-ruby"&gt;citeproc-ruby&lt;/a&gt; project, which (like pandoc-citeproc) enables you to embed citations and filter them through &lt;abbr&gt;CSL&lt;/abbr&gt;s to generate references automatically. As a note: you should definitely be able to get those working on your own deployment sites, but I have no idea whether it’s possible to do them with the GitHub Pages variant of Jekyll. (If anyone who reads this knows the answer to that, let me know on Twitter or App.net, and I’ll update the post accordingly.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="the-future" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to continuing to use &lt;span class="tex"&gt;BibT&lt;span class="texE"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;X&lt;/span&gt; with BibDesk as a way of managing my citations in the short term, I’m thinking about other ways to improve this workflow. One possibility is integrating with &lt;a href="http://scholdoc.scholarlymarkdown.com"&gt;Scholdoc&lt;/a&gt; as it matures, instead of &lt;a href="http://pandoc.org"&gt;pandoc&lt;/a&gt;, and maybe (hopefully, albeit unlikely) even contributing to it somewhat. I’m also open to using other citation library tools, though my early explorations with Mendeley and Zotero did not particularly impress me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are substantial advantages for the applications (and thus for most users) to maintaining the data in an application-specific format (e.g. an SQLite database) rather than on the file system—but the latter has the advantage of making it much easier to integrate with other tools. However, Zotero and Mendeley both natively export to &lt;span class="tex"&gt;BibT&lt;span class="texE"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;X&lt;/span&gt; format, and Mendeley natively supports &lt;a href="http://blog.mendeley.com/tipstricks/howto-use-mendeley-to-create-citations-using-latex-and-bibtex/"&gt;sync&lt;/a&gt; to a &lt;span class="tex"&gt;BibT&lt;span class="texE"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;X&lt;/span&gt; library (Zotero can do the same, but via third-party &lt;a href="https://zoteromusings.wordpress.com/tag/bibtex/"&gt;plugins&lt;/a&gt;), so those remain viable options, which I may use for future projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also want to look at making my library of resources available publicly, perhaps (a) as a standalone library associated with each project, so that anyone who wants to can download it along with the Markdown source to play with as an example and (b) as a general library covering my various reading and research interests, which will certainly be irrelevant to most people but might nonetheless provide some value to someone along the way. I’m a big fan of making this kind of data open wherever possible, because people come up with neat things to do with it that the original creators never expect. Not &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; should be open—but lots of things should, and this might be among them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="summary" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m pretty happy with the current state of affairs, the aforementioned interest in other reference managers notwithstanding:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can set up the citations &lt;em&gt;once&lt;/em&gt;, in a tool designed to manage references, instead of multiple times in multiple places.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can use Pandoc and a &lt;abbr&gt;CSL&lt;/abbr&gt; to get the citations formatted correctly throughout a paper, including generating the bibliography automatically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can use the same tooling, integrated into my static site generator, to build a web version of the content—with no extra effort, once I configured it properly the first time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most importantly, this helps me meet one of my major goals for all my writing: to have a single canonical &lt;em&gt;source&lt;/em&gt; for the content, which I will be able to access in the future regardless of what operating system I am using or what publishing systems come and go. Simple plain text files—Markdown—get me there. Now I’ve put good tools around that process, and I love it even more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="refs" class="references"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section class="footnotes"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coming up with names for footnotes in Markdown can be painful in general for long documents. If you try to name them manually, like I do for posts on my website, you will very quickly end up wasting time on the names. If you try to number them, they will end up out of order in a hurry. My own &lt;a href="http://2012-2013.chriskrycho.com/web/markdown-and-academic-writing/"&gt;previous solution&lt;/a&gt; to this problem quickly became unwieldy for larger papers, and required a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of hand-editing. Gladly, I no longer deal with that manually. Instead, I do all my drafting in &lt;a href="http://www.ulyssesapp.com"&gt;Ulysses&lt;/a&gt;, where you just type &lt;code&gt;(fn)&lt;/code&gt; and it creates a footnote automatically, and will move that footnote &lt;em&gt;object&lt;/em&gt; around transparently as you edit, handling all the number-setting, etc. on its own.&lt;a href="#fnref1"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The irony of site for software which boasts that it is “a high-quality typesetting system” and looks like &lt;a href="http://www.latex-project.org"&gt;&lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is not lost on me…&lt;a href="#fnref2"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn3"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you used the installers on Pandoc’s website, &lt;code&gt;pandoc-citeproc&lt;/code&gt; comes with it. If you installed it via a package manager (e.g. by running &lt;code&gt;brew install pandoc&lt;/code&gt;), it may not have, so you’ll need to install it manually yourself (e.g. &lt;code&gt;brew install pandoc-citeproc&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;a href="#fnref3"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn4"&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the content, including the rendered footnotes and the bibliography, has sensible content types set on it: headers are headers, body text is body text, etc. You can then customize to match the specifications of your style guide. I have a Chicago/Turabian style set set up with the formatting rules to match.&lt;a href="#fnref4"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actually, it was even hairier than this, because I also had a &lt;code&gt;--reference-docx path/to/template.docx&lt;/code&gt; specified. If you think it’s perhaps a bit too complex, well, I agree. I plan to turn that into a command line alias in pretty short order, because remembering it every time is just not going to happen.&lt;a href="#fnref5"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using the &lt;code&gt;--reference-docx&lt;/code&gt; argument to Pandoc, you can hand it a document that already uses your desired style set, so you don’t have to go in and apply it manually.&lt;a href="#fnref6"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn7"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I could have done that with Pandoc’s &lt;span class="tex"&gt;L&lt;span class="texA"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;T&lt;span class="texE"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;X&lt;/span&gt; &lt;abbr&gt;PDF&lt;/abbr&gt; tools, as well, but didn’t really feel like taking the time to tweak the &lt;span class="tex"&gt;L&lt;span class="texA"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;T&lt;span class="texE"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;X&lt;/span&gt; template for it.&lt;a href="#fnref7"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Probably someone does, but not me, and not most people!&lt;a href="#fnref8"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn9"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re using Pelican, you can take a look at my Pelican configuration file &lt;a href="https://github.com/chriskrycho/chriskrycho.com/blob/ef3ecbca1765750392086355aeae026c1159d4b9/pelicanconf.py#L109"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the full configuration for using Pandoc this way.&lt;a href="#fnref9"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn10"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Optimally, I’d really just prefer to be able to set &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of these arguments at a per-file level—i.e., not use &lt;code&gt;--filter pandoc cite-proc&lt;/code&gt; unless the file actually specifies a bibliography. And I could hack Pelican to do that; I’ve actually already &lt;a href="https://github.com/liob/pandoc_reader/pull/5"&gt;messed around&lt;/a&gt; with other, semi-related bits regarding Pelican and Pandoc’s shared handling of &lt;abbr&gt;YAML&lt;/abbr&gt; metadata. But I’d prefer to keep my installation as “vanilla” as possible to minimize the cost of setting things up again on a new machine or after a crash, etc.&lt;a href="#fnref10"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

I’m delighted at the result. In the next few days, I’ll write up a short post on how I did it, because it’s &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; handy for academics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="refs" class="references"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chris Krycho</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jul 2015 22:03:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:www.chriskrycho.com,2015-07-22:2015/2015-07-22-2203.html</guid></item><item><title>Not Exactly a Millennium</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2015/not-exactly-a-millennium.html</link><description>&lt;section id="introduction" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few books are as perplexing to modern readers as Revelation, and few matters within it as controversial as the nature of the millennium. As one commentator put it, “Judging from the amount of attention given by many writers to the first ten verses of chapter 20, one would think they were the single most important section of the book of Revelation.”&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The three major millennial readings—pre-, a-, and postmillennial—divide on how to read the sequence. Both amillennial and postmillennial interpretations affirm that Christ will return at the end of the millennium and that there will be a single resurrection, whereas the premillennial interpretation anticipates Christ returning to &lt;em&gt;inaugurate&lt;/em&gt; the millennium, raising (some or all of) the saints at that time and then raising all who remain at the end of the millennium for final judgment. This paper will argue that John did not in fact intend to establish a totally new doctrine of a millennium (of any sort) in this much-debated sequence, but rather intended to succor his audience with the hope of God’s faithfulness to his promises. That is: the millennial passage indicates not a duration of time—not even an indeterminate sequence as in some idealist or historicist readings—but rather depicts symbolically and numerologically the fulfillment of the promises made to the saints elsewhere in Revelation and the rest of Scripture. In particular, he draws on imagery and the recapitulatory pattern established in Ezekiel 37–48,&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; presenting the same conflict multiple times from different angles to emphasize the sovereignty of God and the surety of his salvation and vindication of his saints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="context" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Context&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revelation was most likely written by John the Apostle from exile on the island of Patmos in the early-to-mid-90s A.D., though it is impossible to be certain of either authorship or provenance.&lt;a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The churches which constituted John’s audience—the seven addressees of the letters that opened the book—were facing a history of persecution and the threat of future persecution. As early as the 60s A.D., the church had faced serious persecution under Nero, and it continued to face varying degrees of opposition in the years that followed. The book served then—and has served the church ever since—as an exhortation to endure and an encouragement that whatever trials come, God will accomplish justice in the end and vindicate his saints.&lt;a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the purpose of the book is thus relatively clear, it remains difficult to interpret because of outstanding questions regarding its genre and structure. The book opens and closes in epistolary fashion; it declares itself to be a prophecy; and it is explicitly titled an apocalypse and bears all the hallmarks of the genre.&lt;a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; As with many apocalypses, and like the Old Testament prophecies on which it is modeled and from which it draws, the book functions not merely as revelation, but also (and perhaps primarily) as exhortation—thus the epistolary frame and the consistent thematic warning against idolatry.&lt;a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; As with apocalyptic literature in general, the book is heavy on imagery, metaphor, and symbolic representations. As such, it conveys its message at the three distinct levels of &lt;em&gt;visionary&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;historical&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;referential&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;symbolic&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Leaping directly from the visionary to the referential level without considering the symbolic meanings will certainly lead to misinterpretation within the genre. Indeed, the book itself indicates that it conveys its message primarily through symbols.&lt;a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Thus, right interpretation of the text must respect literary convention and take care not to leap from the content of John’s vision to a proposed referent without considering how symbolism may be at play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="exegesis" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Exegesis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The millennial passage does not stand alone, but is part of the final, conclusive judgment cycle, beginning in 19:11 and concluding at the end of chapter 20. The sequence is comprised of five “And I saw…”&lt;a href="#fn9" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref9"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; sequences, which begin in 19:11, 19:17, 20:1, 20:4, and 20:11. The millennium itself is introduced in 20:2–3 and discussion of the millennium carries on through the final defeat of Satan after his release “when the thousand years are ended” (20:7).&lt;a href="#fn10" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref10"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; After God’s final crushing victory over Satan, the scene turns to eternal judgment at the great white throne. Throughout the entire final sequence, he draws heavily on the narrative, language, and imagery of Ezekiel 37–48. Thus, John’s cycle of judgment passages leads directly into a discussion of the new Jerusalem, just as Ezekiel’s judgment sequence leads into his lengthy treatment of the future, eschatological temple.&lt;a href="#fn11" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref11"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Finally, John synthesizes these images from both Ezekiel with eschatological language from Isaiah, combining the two great visions into a unified whole. This pattern, and the imagery layered throughout, should both caution the reader from interpreting the sequence in strict chronological fashion—Ezekiel’s treatment is expressly recapitulatory&lt;a href="#fn12" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref12"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—and suggest that John’s intent may be comment and synthesis rather than the formulation of a wholly new doctrine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="a-climactic-battle-with-the-beast-and-the-false-prophet" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;19:11–21: A Climactic Battle with the Beast and the False Prophet&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John opens this final section of the book with two visions. The first (19:11–16) is an image of Christ as the divine warrior, the Word of God, whose word destroys the enemies of God. The second (19:17–21) is of the defeat of those enemies and a horrifying feast—the dreadful inverse of the wedding supper of the Lamb.&lt;a href="#fn13" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref13"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Here is the first of several significant clues that the millennial passage that follows &lt;em&gt;recapitulates&lt;/em&gt; rather than &lt;em&gt;follows&lt;/em&gt; this battle. Throughout the book, with the sole exception of the appearance of nations in glory in the conclusion, “the nations” (τὰ ἐθνῆ) appear to the rebellious nations in contrast with the saints&lt;a href="#fn14" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref14"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—and the nations are &lt;em&gt;completely&lt;/em&gt; destroyed here. The beast and false prophet are thrown into the lake of fire (19:20), and “the rest were slain by the sword that came from the mouth of him who was sitting on the horse” (19:21). The deceived nations that join Satan in Satan in his post-millennial war must be understood in light of this destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="the-millenniumsatan-bound-saints-reigning-with-christ" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;20:1–6: The Millennium—Satan Bound, Saints Reigning with Christ&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 20:1–3, John describes an angel binding Satan and locking him in an abyss for a thousand years. In vv. 4–6, he describes the “first resurrection” and the thousand-year reign of the martyrs-and-saints with Christ.&lt;a href="#fn15" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref15"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; On the one hand, the language used here for binding Satan seems fairly strong: the angel binds him, then shuts him in the Abyss and seals and locks it.&lt;a href="#fn16" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref16"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; On the other hand, this is not the first place where the New Testament speaks of Satan’s being bound (cf. especially Mark 3:27 and the parallel in Matt. 12:29, Luke 19:17–18, John 12:31, Col. 2:15).&lt;a href="#fn17" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref17"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Nor is it the first place where angelic forces defeat Satan and restrain his power (cf. Rev. 12).&lt;a href="#fn18" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref18"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The angel binds Satan, and the point seems to be the &lt;em&gt;effect&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;efficacy&lt;/em&gt; rather than the &lt;em&gt;extent&lt;/em&gt; of the binding: to prevent Satan from deceiving the nations and from assaulting the saints, until the climactic final battle.&lt;a href="#fn19" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref19"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; It also establishes God’s rule: Satan is powerless to resist.&lt;a href="#fn20" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref20"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After describing Satan’s binding, John turns his attention (another “and I saw”) to saints sharing in the first resurrection. Notably, these saints are seated on thrones, and John has used the language of martyr-saints and thrones before (see 6:9ff).&lt;a href="#fn21" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref21"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The word “throne” appears some forty-seven times in the book, and apart from references to Satan’s or the beast’s rule, all of them (save perhaps these) unambiguously refer to heaven, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; earth.&lt;a href="#fn22" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref22"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The link strongly suggests that the scene is not the earth in some future age, but heaven, and reinforces the notion that John is recapitulating material he has covered before, rather than continuing sequentially from what preceded in the text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John’s language of the “first resurrection” (20:6) and the ingressive use of preterite ζάω, “They came to life…” and “the rest… did not come to life” (20:4–5) are perhaps the strongest arguments in favor of a premillennial reading of the passage. The language suggests bodily resurrection, and indeed it is unusual for the same word to be used first of spiritual and then of physical resurrection only a few phrases apart.&lt;a href="#fn23" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref23"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; However, there are reasons within the text itself to think this is not John’s point. The first resurrection here includes all of, but only, the righteous; and the second all of, but only, the unrighteous.&lt;a href="#fn24" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref24"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Similarly, and more conclusively, the &lt;em&gt;second death&lt;/em&gt; that parallels the (implied but never mentioned!) second resurrection&lt;a href="#fn25" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref25"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is at least primarily spiritual, while the first is clearly physical; it is therefore possible the inverse is true of the resurrections.&lt;a href="#fn26" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref26"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The kind of “coming to life” on display here is thus not &lt;em&gt;necessarily&lt;/em&gt; final resurrection, but spiritual life in the interval between Christ’s comings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More broadly, the literary tenor of the passage warrants caution beyond even that already suggested by the apocalyptic setting. The passage is saturated in symbolism and imagery: “chain,” “key,” “Abyss,” “dragon,” “ancient serpent,” “locked,” and “sealed” are all certainly images representing realities, rather than literal depictions of those realities.&lt;a href="#fn27" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref27"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Given ten’s association with completeness or perfection, the use of its third power is clearly symbolic as well.&lt;a href="#fn28" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref28"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Moreover, John here draws on imagery that was already prevalent in the apocalyptic literature that formed the context of his audience’s expectation. The notion of a Messianic millennium was not his invention, though he did bring it to bear in a unique context within the Christian canon.&lt;a href="#fn29" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref29"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; To suggest, then, that these “thousand years” &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be taken as a literal depiction of time, regardless of how often John repeats it, is to mistake the literary context and John’s intended meaning.&lt;a href="#fn30" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref30"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;All&lt;/em&gt; the numbers in Revelation appear to have a figurative rather than literal referent.&lt;a href="#fn31" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref31"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Indeed, any directly literal approach to the millennium is necessarily “an incredible way to treat numbers in an apocalypse!”&lt;a href="#fn32" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref32"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, a symbolic reading of the thousand years seems best—and not only in the sense that the time period in view is not literally one thousand years, but also in the sense that it points to something other than a physical reign of the martyr-saints on earth entirely. One of the functions of the millennium, on any reading, is to demonstrate both Satan’s and the nations’ lack of repentance. Neither does a thousand years of being restrained chasten Satan whatsoever, nor does that interval where Satan is restrained change the hearts of rebellious men and women.&lt;a href="#fn33" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref33"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Both Satan and rebellious humanity vindicate God’s judgment against them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="a-climactic-battle-with-satan" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;20:7–10: A Climactic Battle with Satan&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not itself a distinct section,&lt;a href="#fn34" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref34"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the final war with Satan recapitulates material already covered in Revelation 16–19, and also links back to both of the immediately preceding “and I saw” sections.&lt;a href="#fn35" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref35"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;35&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Here is one of the major clues that John is not building a theology of the millennium: the climactic defeat of Satan here directly echoes the previous defeat at Armageddon (16:14) and the defeat of the beast and false prophet (see above).&lt;a href="#fn36" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref36"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Indeed “the war” (ὁ πόλεμος) appears only here, at 16:14, and 19:19 in the book, further tying them together.&lt;a href="#fn37" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref37"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;37&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; As noted above, the nations were utterly destroyed in the battle in 19:17–21, yet appear again here as Satan’s pawns only to be destroyed completely again. Even commentators who suppose a basically premillennial outlook therefore grant that the sequence of events with the nations here is difficult to make chronological sense of in premillennial terms.&lt;a href="#fn38" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref38"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;38&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; This is the same battle, with the same enemies, and the same outcome. John is indeed following Ezekiel’s outline; like the prophet, he retells the same battle from two angles. Just as the beast and false prophet deceived the nations and led them to destruction, Satan deceives the nations only to lead them to destruction. Indeed, this serves as the conclusion to a large-scale chiasm running from the beginning of ch. 12. John introduces Satan, the beast and the false prophet, and Babylon, and in turn God judges Babylon, the beast and the false prophet, and finally Satan.&lt;a href="#fn39" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref39"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;39&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This outcome is as expected, in light of the rest of the book and especially the preceding section it so clearly echoes. There, Christ defeated the Beast and the false prophet utterly; here God defeats Satan utterly. No actual battle appears in either case: God’s and Christ’s victory is immediate and without contest.&lt;a href="#fn40" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref40"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Satan’s deception comes to an end once and for all, every one of his tools (whether the harlot, the false prophet and the beast, or the rebellious nations of the earth) unable to stand before God.&lt;a href="#fn41" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref41"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;41&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; As in Ezekiel, the rebellious nations are destroyed in the first telling with a sword, in the second telling with fire.&lt;a href="#fn42" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref42"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;42&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Likewise, the end of Satan’s deceptions of the nations culminates in his being thrown into the lake of fire, just as were the other deceivers in ch. 19.&lt;a href="#fn43" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref43"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;43&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The millennium is not a sequence &lt;em&gt;following&lt;/em&gt; the war against the saints, but a second image of the time that &lt;em&gt;leads up to&lt;/em&gt; that final confrontation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="after-judgment-then-consummation" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;After: Judgment, Then Consummation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Satan’s defeat, the living and the dead are judged, and those whose names are not found in the book of life are subjected to the second death—this one spiritual, joining the beast, the false prophet, and Satan in the lake of fire. Notably, the dead who are judged have not gone previously to the lake of fire here—unlike the rest of the New Testament’s expectation that the dead will be judged immediately at Christ’s return.&lt;a href="#fn44" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref44"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;44&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; At the last, Death and Hades join them (just as in 1 Cor. 15:26).&lt;a href="#fn45" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref45"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;45&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Again: these are symbolic images; the visionary content cannot be translated into future-historical referents directly and without interpretation. These conclusive events &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; help resolve the point of the millennium itself, though: they align all the final judgments together, synchronize John’s telling with the Ezekiel narration he is interpreting. Thus, John turns immediately after the judgment to the final vision of the book: the New Jerusalem, and the new Heavens and new Earth, and the descent of God to dwell with humanity forever. As in Ezekiel, the focus is on the shape of the future temple, as a symbol of the perfect restoration of God’s place of fellowship with humanity—only magnified manifold even beyond Ezekiel’s vision. Further, John’s integration of Isaianic imagery here into the new Jerusalem/heaven and earth strongly militates against interpreting Isaiah 65 as pointing to a millennial age.&lt;a href="#fn46" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref46"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;46&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The turn to this massively perfect garden-city-temple emphasizes the finality of God’s eschatological work. It also further demonstrates that John’s concern, unlike so many commentators, was not the establishment of a doctrine of a millennium. Rather, John sought to make clear that God’s victory would be final and complete, that justice would be done in the world, and that the saints would have the reward he promised them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="concern" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Concern&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The church may err—indeed, &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; erred—in several ways in its interpretation of the Apocalypse. One the one hand, she may swerve into the kind of sensuousness attributed to Papias and others early in the history of the church, prompting Origin and Augustine to take a purely spiritual reading of the millennium, with the Reformers following them. On the other hand, the church has sometimes carried this idealized reading into spiritualizing away Christ’s return. Neither of these are good. John’s millennium is not a literal thousand years, nor even an unspecified-but-lengthy period of time when the former saints reign in resurrected bodies on a still-fallen earth, with sin yet-unjudged, over others who are still mortal and can reject salvation.&lt;a href="#fn47" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref47"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;47&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; But it is not a throwaway idea, and it should not lead the church to mischaracterize &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; elements of John’s eschatology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John uses this language not to outline a new eschatological doctrine, but to shine light on an old one: God’s work overthrowing the powers of the present age in his Messiah’s incarnation, life, death, resurrection, and ascension. He reiterates what he and others have already said: Satan’s power to deceive the nations has been broken, because the strong man came and bound him.&lt;a href="#fn48" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref48"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Christ is reigning &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt; (Hebrews 1:3–4), though there is a greater reign yet to come. Moreover, the broader context of the book makes clear that John’s point here is not to suggest some future half-way stop between fall and glory. Rather, he assures saints that even now, Satan’s hatred and lies are restrained—however fierce they may seem at times. As such, the saints can stand fast in the face of whatever trials they face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two major implications of this reading for the life of the church. First, and foundational for the second, Revelation as a book and this passage specifically have something to say to the church &lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt;. These are not merely vague notions about an unknown future, which confuse rather than comfort. Instead, they are a symbolic (but for that no less &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt;) proclamation of the reign of Jesus Christ, the Ancient of Days, the King of Kings and Lord of Lords who will one day let Satan loose only to destroy him and his evil utterly. Secondly, therefore, the church should &lt;em&gt;preach&lt;/em&gt; this book, and regularly. John’s promises about the future will lead the church now to stand fast when the surrounding world calls for compromise and the temptation to idolatry rears its head, as it does in every generation. Satan is bound; Christ reigns &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;, and the saints with him; and someday Christ will come again, judge the living and the dead once for all, and consummate his kingdom. “Here is a call for the endurance of the saints, those who keep the commandments of God and their faith in Jesus” (Rev. 14:12). The indicative—Christ reigns, Satan is bound—prompts an imperative: life as if this is so!&lt;a href="#fn49" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref49"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;49&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Come temptations to materialism, or the worship of ancestors, or nationalism, or any other idolatry, Christians proclaim Christ alone is Lord.&lt;/p&gt;

Div.</category><category>papers</category></item><item><title>Tweets on Psych Medication</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2015/tweets-on-psych-medication.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday evening, I saw Peter Leithart (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PLeithart"&gt;@PLeithart&lt;/a&gt;) retweet this from the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_Theopolis"&gt;@_Theopolis&lt;/a&gt; account:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psych meds are a lobotomy in a bottle. -Rich Bledsoe&lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_Theopolis/status/623671327447248896"&gt;∞&lt;/a&gt; July 21, 2015 21:50&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I responded, because I’m a theologically conservative Christian with a high view of the value of spiritual work on our psyches, and therefore agree with much of the &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; of this critique—but also a Christian with a robust anthropology (of the sort I would expect Leithart to have!) which undercuts &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; kind of response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it is simply that I am more attuned to these things because my wife deals with clinical depression, but in any case this kind of thinking is &lt;em&gt;profoundly&lt;/em&gt; destructive, and all-too common in the church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My response:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_Theopolis"&gt;@_Theopolis&lt;/a&gt; No. This is a horrifyingly misguided and indeed misanthropic way of stating what may be a useful critique. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PLeithart"&gt;@PLeithart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chriskrycho/status/623672572551561220"&gt;∞&lt;/a&gt; July 21, 2015 21:55&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_Theopolis"&gt;@_Theopolis&lt;/a&gt; It is one thing to say that we overmedicate—we do. It is another to say that psych meds lobotomize us—they do not. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PLeithart"&gt;@PLeithart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chriskrycho/status/623672684434599936"&gt;∞&lt;/a&gt; July 21, 2015 21:55&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_Theopolis"&gt;@_Theopolis&lt;/a&gt; To put it in these terms &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt; is to mistake at the most fundamental level our embodied, fallen, human nature. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PLeithart"&gt;@PLeithart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chriskrycho/status/623672770069680128"&gt;∞&lt;/a&gt; July 21, 2015 21:55&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_Theopolis"&gt;@_Theopolis&lt;/a&gt; We must say “No” to the captivity of self-medication &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; rejecting the gift of medicine for broken bodies. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PLeithart"&gt;@PLeithart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chriskrycho/status/623673129072762880"&gt;∞&lt;/a&gt; July 21, 2015 21:57&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_Theopolis"&gt;@_Theopolis&lt;/a&gt; And our bodies include our brains; we are not conveniently separable entities, with psyches untrammeled from flesh. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PLeithart"&gt;@PLeithart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chriskrycho/status/623673258840354816"&gt;∞&lt;/a&gt; July 21, 2015 21:57&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_Theopolis"&gt;@_Theopolis&lt;/a&gt; So by all means, proceed with a critique of cultural folly. But do so with pastoral sensitivity to damaged sheep. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PLeithart"&gt;@PLeithart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chriskrycho/status/623673467259518976"&gt;∞&lt;/a&gt; July 21, 2015 21:58&lt;/p&gt;

While this division is tragic, it does rightly reflect the importance of the issue, reflecting as it does on central issues including a church’s or denomination’s Christology, pneumatology, and ecclesiology. It is both important enough to divide over, and central enough to warrant ongoing effort to reconcile over. However, to either rightly divide or rightly reunite, believers must have a clear understanding of the issues at stake in the discussion, as well as the Biblical, theological, reasonable, and traditional bases for those reasons.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three major questions confront the church regarding the Lord’s Supper: &lt;em&gt;What is it?&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Who may administer it?&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Who may receive it?&lt;/em&gt; The first question is a matter of Christology and sacramentology; the second and third questions are ecclesiological, but depend on the first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="christology-and-sacramentology" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Christology and sacramentology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The classic Catholic view, &lt;em&gt;transubstantiation&lt;/em&gt; is the idea that in the Lord’s Supper, the body and blood of Christ become truly, physically present in the elements—not in their physical makeup, but in their ontological reality.&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Protestants have frequently characterized this view as a &lt;em&gt;re-sacrifice&lt;/em&gt; of Christ, in which the priest sacrifices Christ again. The actual Roman Catholic view is not a &lt;em&gt;re-offering of Christ&lt;/em&gt;, however, but a &lt;em&gt;re-presentation of Christ’s offering&lt;/em&gt;. Put another way, when the priest offers the sacrament, the congregation mystically participates in the once-for-all action that Christ accomplished at the cross in time and space.&lt;a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Granting that the Protestant characterization accurately reflects popular Catholic piety regarding the Mass—but just as Protestants would not wish to be judged on the worst excesses of their own traditions’ popular piety, so they should interact with the best of Catholic thought and not only its worst extremes.) Catholics further believe that God provides grace to aid the believer in life and to save from the power of sin by taking the mass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lutheran concept of the Table is different from the Catholic position, but nearer it than most other Protestant views. Luther rejected many elements of Roman Catholic &lt;em&gt;practice&lt;/em&gt; of the mass, along with the Catholic doctrines of transubstantiation and re-presentation.&lt;a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; However, he insisted that Christ’s body and blood were nonetheless physically present in the bread and wine. In support of this view, he leaned heavily on the language of the words of institution, “This is my body… this is my blood…” The simple declaration he took to be a clear indication of &lt;em&gt;reality&lt;/em&gt;, rather than &lt;em&gt;sign&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;signified&lt;/em&gt; (as Zwingli argued in their debates). That is: “the body and blood of Christ are received through the acts of eating and drink… the consecrated bread &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; his body and the consecrated wine &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; his blood.”&lt;a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Many) Lutherans are thus inclined to take the Reformed view (see below) as of an “&lt;em&gt;unreal, fictitious&lt;/em&gt; presence” in contrast with a real, “&lt;em&gt;corporeal&lt;/em&gt; presence.”&lt;a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are variations in the Reformed tradition, most prominently Zwingli’s memorial view and Calvin’s “real” or “spiritual” presence view. Of these, Calvin’s is the most distinctive and the most widely practiced apart from Zwingli’s view, and is the dominant view among orthodox/Westminster Presbyterians. Calvin argued that Supper is a gift from God the Father, which points to Jesus Christ, as the Holy Spirit makes Christ really present to believers.&lt;a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; He took the words of institution to indicate that Jesus really is present with believers in the feast—“the incarnate, risen and ascended Jesus Christ along with the grace that God promises.”&lt;a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; For Calvin and his successors, the bread and wine are really bread and wine, and these untransformed elements are themselves part of God’s gift.&lt;a href="#fn9" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref9"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; At the same time, this view takes the words of institution as more than mere sign-language; it affirms that through the Spirit believers are truly partaking of Christ himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably the dominant view among Western evangelicals is that the Supper is symbolic or memorial only. First articulated by Zwingli and championed by the Anabaptists and Baptists in the centuries that followed, this approach has its adherents among nearly all present-day free-church denominations and non-denominational churches, including the majority of Baptists and charismatics (of all “waves”). There is no single view among Baptists or other low-church evangelicals (Pentecostals or other charismatics included), since they have no single binding authority, whether ecclesiastical or confessional.&lt;a href="#fn10" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref10"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Nonetheless, some standard contours do emerge: baptist theologians tend to emphasize that the grace of God is specially present, but only in the same ways it is specially present in preaching, fellowship, or other normal means of grace. On the other hand, common piety regards the supper as purely symbolic, having no gracious content whatsoever.&lt;a href="#fn11" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref11"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Popular views among charismatics may modify this somewhat, however, by including the idea of healing at the Table, as an act of the Spirit for the gathered church.&lt;a href="#fn12" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref12"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="ecclesiological-practice" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ecclesiological Practice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly all major traditions partake of the Lord’s Supper as gathered churches—not in individual or family settings (though there are of course exceptions). While some denominations and organizations also practice the Eucharist in parachurch contexts, this is the exception rather than the rule.&lt;a href="#fn13" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref13"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The Catholic church offers the Mass daily: as the supreme sacrament and primary means of grace in the life of a Catholic believer, it must be taken frequently. Lutherans, most Reformed churches, Anglicans, and Methodists generally take the Supper weekly, usually as the climax of the Sunday service. By contrast, most other low-church evangelicals—whether denominationally affiliated or not, and whether charismatic or not—come to the table much less frequently. There is no typical pattern among such groups. Taking the supper as rarely as once or twice a year is not unheard-of, taking it weekly is rare, and monthly or quarterly perhaps the most common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various demoninations’ restrictions on the Table vary significantly. The Catholic and Orthodox generally restrict the Table to those in communion with their traditions. Some (though by no means all) Lutherans and Reformed similarly bar from the Supper those who do not share their particular confessional stances.&lt;a href="#fn14" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref14"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Among the free church traditions, practices vary widely. On the one hand, many modern baptistic churches practice fully open communion&lt;a href="#fn15" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref15"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—a practice that has deep roots in the tradition, dating at least to the practice of John Newton’s church. On the other hand, the majority of Baptists historically and many today argue for closed communion, where only believers baptized &lt;em&gt;as believers&lt;/em&gt; (and usually by immersion) may take communion.&lt;a href="#fn16" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref16"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Across all traditions, advocates of more “open” communion emphasize that it is a universal church institution that emphasizes Christ’s work on behalf of &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; believers, while those in favor of “closed” communion emphasize the importance of the elements that do separate the denominations—not least their Christology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="spiritual-presence-practiced-regularly" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Spiritual Presence, Practiced Regularly&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the Roman Catholic and Lutheran traditions are commendable for their attentiveness to the words of institution, there remain substantial problems with both their views. The Roman Catholic emphasis on priestly mediation of the mass obscures Christ’s all-sufficiency as mediator; likewise, the language of re-presentation of Christ’s sacrifice obscures the finality of Christ’s act on the cross. The Lutheran view recognizes no distinction whatsoever between sign and thing signified, and it hangs on the interpretation of the crucial “is” in the words of institution, ironically without regard for how language (sign) may convey something other than than bare sense (signified). Meanwhile, purely symbolic/memorial views fail to give due attention to either the seriousness of Christ’s words at institution or the ways in which God has always mediated his grace through physical signs and symbols. The language of both Old and New Testament ordinances is more than merely figurative: God really did something in the sacrifice of sheep and goats, and he really does something in baptism, church discipline, and the Eucharist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calvin’s “real presence” view seems the best of the options. It maintains the immensity of Christ’s proclamation of his presence, but without insisting on a view of that presence that diminishes his corporeal ascension. It maintains a truly sacramental view of the material elements, thereby claiming the goodness of the created order and God’s right to use his created world in particular and spiritual ways, but without embracing an &lt;em&gt;ex opere operato&lt;/em&gt; interpretation of his grace along the way. Finally, it both maintains the actual presence of Christ himself and is beautifully Trinitarian, understanding that presence as effected by the Spirit, who both catches the believer up to heaven and mediates the Savior to his people in their fellowship, as believers partake of the free gift of the Father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lord’s Supper is a demonstration of the unity of Christ’s people, and as such it should be extended as widely as possible. On the one hand, it is important to offer the Supper only to those who are professing believers in Christ. On the other, refusing communion to those who worship the Trinitarian God in the risen Lord Jesus proclaims division in the very practice meant to display the church’s unity. Against the practice of “closed” communion, churches should welcome to the table any who trust in Christ. “It is a meal of remembrance for Jesus’ sacrifice that brought us forgiveness from sins. As such it is solely a meal for disciples…. Therefore our communion is open to all who profess to be followers and disciples of Christ.”&lt;a href="#fn17" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref17"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As to frequency, Scripture is silent, and so it behooves Christians today not to press any position too strongly. Yet it still seems fair to say that if indeed the ordinance is a place of special meeting between Christ and his people, then his people should be eager to meet with him often. In that light, weekly communion seems best. However, this does not necessarily entail partaking of the Table in every service (though it may). Churches might also opt to leave it at its current monthly or quarterly frequency for corporate gatherings, but make it a part of the weekly gathering of small groups, for example, thus emphasizing both the broader community of the church and the particular unity of the communities within it.&lt;a href="#fn18" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref18"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="conclusion" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many believers are tempted to dismiss these sorts of details as of little importance—secondary issues that do not or should not affect them or the life of their church. However, because the church’s practice of the Lord’s Supper has implications in so much of the church’s life, her doctrine and practice at the Table are in fact quite important. Rightly understood and practiced, the Table teaches the church about Christology, the communion of the saints, the work of the Spirit, the goodness of the created order, and the relationship between Christ’s work and God’s grace. These are not light matters; they are foundational in the life of the church. The high-church traditions certainly have this much right, then: the liturgies and practices of the church matter. Indeed, in many ways, the &lt;em&gt;practices&lt;/em&gt; of a community may be as profound a force in shaping her people as the &lt;em&gt;proclamations&lt;/em&gt; of her leaders.&lt;a href="#fn19" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref19"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Any Christian community with deficient views or practices of communion will &lt;em&gt;necessarily&lt;/em&gt; be lacking in its worship and fellowship. Christians are called to unity, and it is around the table that their unity is most deeply proclaimed. If there is any place for ecumenism among Christian denominations, it is at the Table. Likewise, Christians are called to worship not just Christ-the-idea, but Christ-the-man, whose body and blood they spiritually receive for the nourishment of their souls: the good gift of the Father, worked in them by the Spirit. Christ the Lord is seated in heaven, and is spiritually present everywhere, but he is spiritually present &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; at the Table,&lt;a href="#fn20" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref20"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and this is a great comfort to saints in the midst of trials and woes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wesleyan Quadrilateral is a helpful framework for all theological work, and perhaps especially for any sort of ecumenical work, so long as the centrality and final authority of Scripture itself over the other criteria is upheld.&lt;a href="#fnref1"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jeffrey Gros, “The Roman Catholic View,” in &lt;em&gt;The Lord’s Supper: Five Views&lt;/em&gt;, ed. Gordon T.

&lt;li id="fn3"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gros, 19–20.&lt;a href="#fnref3"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn4"&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the least, he rejected his understanding of those views, and probably as well the Catholic church’s popular teaching at the item; leaving aside aside the issue of Roman Catholic views on tradition and authority, is is possible either that Luther was mistaken on Catholic dogma or that Catholic teaching has been clarified helpfully in the intervening centuries.&lt;a href="#fnref4"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;John R. Stephenson, “The Lutheran View,” in Smith, 45.&lt;a href="#fnref5"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id="fn15"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So Olson, 37, “Withholding sacramental sharing on the basis of disagreement about the nature of the Lord’s supper seems odd to us… we are not offended by Catholics’ closed Communion, but we find it odd and exclusive”—a sentiment he reiterates on p. 64.&lt;a href="#fnref15"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id="fn18"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This highlights the contextual nature of the practice: while regular Communion is a natural outworking of any sacramental view, the way that works out in practice naturally looks very different in a house church than in a megachurch, and different in Kenya than in Kansas.&lt;a href="#fnref18"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

Today, I set aside my ongoing work on new user-facing functionality and dedicated what working time I had to hunting down the cause of this and fixing it at last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was surprised to find the culprit: the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;base&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag. If you don’t know what the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;base&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag is, you’re not alone. It is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; used all that much in general, and I had never actually seen it on a site before starting on this project last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what went wrong? How do these two things play together?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am using (and reusing) SVG items throughout the HolyBible.com interface, taking advantage of the ability to define symbols and reference them with the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;use&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag, like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;svg version=&amp;quot;1.1&amp;quot; xmlns=&amp;quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&amp;quot; xmlns:xlink=&amp;quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&amp;quot; xmlns:ev=&amp;quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events&amp;quot; style=&amp;quot;display: none&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;symbol id=&amp;quot;logo-shape&amp;quot; viewBox=&amp;quot;0 0 256 256&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;title&amp;gt;Logo&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;desc&amp;gt;The HolyBible.com logo: sunrise breaking over an open book (the Bible).&amp;lt;/desc&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;path id=&amp;quot;logo-light&amp;quot; d=&amp;quot;M172.1 116.3l5.1-4.1-12.5-.5 32-26.3-41.4 18.4 11-20.1L148 96l12.2-37.5L138.8 91l.1-36.2-10.3 34.4L114 36.1l4.3 54.9-22.2-34.9 13 39.9-18.3-12.4 11 20.1-42.5-19.2 32.8 26.9-10.4.8 4.4 3.9c13.1-1.6 27.4-2.7 42.4-2.7 15.4 0 30.1 1.2 43.6 2.9z&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;path id=&amp;quot;logo-book&amp;quot; d=&amp;quot;M199.9 219.9c-47.4-9.8-96.4-9.8-143.8 0-6-28.9-12-57.7-17.9-86.6 59.3-12.3 120.4-12.3 179.7 0-6 28.9-12 57.8-18 86.6z&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/symbol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/svg&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;!-- somewhere else on the page --&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;svg&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;use xlink:href=&amp;quot;#logo-shape&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/use&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/svg&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout all my early prototyping, this worked perfectly across all modern browsers. (For more, see &lt;a href="https://css-tricks.com/svg-sprites-use-better-icon-fonts/"&gt;CSS Tricks&lt;/a&gt;.) Now, when I started moving from the prototype phase into actually building the application in Angular last fall, I learned that you have to set the base URL for the application using the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;base&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag to use the HTML5 Location API with Angular 1.x. If you want URL-based, rather than &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt;-based navigation in an Angular app, you need this. Following the recommendation of whatever documentation and tutorials I found, I set it so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;base href=&amp;quot;/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, this was the recommendation I saw in every bit of documentation and every tutorial, so I assumed it would have no problems. As it turns it, that’s not the case. (This is a &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2015/how-to-build-a-single-page-app-api-right.html"&gt;recurring theme&lt;/a&gt; in my experience with Angular.) In Chrome, Safari, and IE9+, this works exactly as expected. In Firefox, however, it does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;. The use of the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;base&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag changes the behavior of &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt;-based URLs on a page. Specifically, it makes it so that if you’re at a URL that &lt;em&gt;isn’t&lt;/em&gt; the base route, anchor links don’t behave as expected. In order to make the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;use&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag as expected, we would have to use the same URL as the base tag. Among other things, this would require making sure that any place we used the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;use&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag, we would have to set that—not exactly a good idea, given that it would entail an awful lot of changes if the base URL were ever changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if, instead, we did this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;document.write(&amp;#39;&amp;lt;base href=&amp;quot;&amp;#39; + document.location.origin + &amp;#39;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&amp;#39;);&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This way, when the page renders, it writes the document location based on the &lt;em&gt;current&lt;/em&gt; location. The URL history still behaves as expected with Angular, but the relative URLs for IDs behave as expected in Firefox again, while not breaking the behavior in any other browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But… then you’ll navigate to another page, and Firefox will be back to not working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/8934#issuecomment-56568466"&gt;solution&lt;/a&gt;, it turns out, only came into being after I’d done the initial implementation, and I have no idea how much later it found its way into the Angular docs. However, even though it now &lt;em&gt;exists&lt;/em&gt; in the docs, it’s by no means obvious why you should do it this way, and certainly no mention of SVG! This might not seem odd to you… but it should, given that the only reason that Angular introduced this API change was to account for &lt;em&gt;exactly this issue&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the Angular docs note, leaving out the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;base&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag means all your URLs have to be absolute if you want to use HTML5 location and the &lt;code&gt;$locationProvider&lt;/code&gt;. If you want to use SVGs with &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;use&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and Firefox, though, that’s what you have to do (and therefore that’s what I’m doing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fun times, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="refs" class="references"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;section class="footnotes"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The closest it gets is this reference:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Links that only contain a hash fragment (e.g. &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;#target&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;) will only change &lt;code&gt;$location.hash()&lt;/code&gt; and not modify the url otherwise. This is useful for scrolling to anchors on the same page without needing to know on which page the user currently is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even this, however, only &lt;em&gt;hints&lt;/em&gt; at the root of the SVG issue.&lt;a href="#fnref1"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

I’ll blame it on a lack of self-discipline… or perhaps on the presence thereof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every day, we face choices about where to spend our time. In this particular season of life, that has often meant not writing, even things I &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to write. I have a family to care for, a church to serve, work to do, and schoolwork to accomplish. Family is a daily endeavor, work and school nearly so, and church regular if not quite daily. In the midst of that, I have to decide: &lt;em&gt;What will I do today?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our culture tends to put the question in terms of balance; my friend and pastor Ashok Nachnani suggested to me a while back that it is better to think in terms of &lt;em&gt;faithfulness&lt;/em&gt;. “Balance” suggests holding all these things in equal proportion, juggling them against each other. “Faithfulness” suggests fulfilling the responsibilities as best we can, with the time we are given. The actual day-to-day outcome may not look particularly different, but it is an important shift in the way we think nonetheless. To be faithful may mean letting some desireable things go, and it may mean doing some things in a different way or to a lesser degree than we might like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; writing. I like keeping a public record for my friends and family to see how my life is. I enjoy stretching my mental muscles in the way that writing requires. I enjoy thinking through pen or keyboard. But faithfulness to the responsibilities God has given me right now means &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; trying to balance those desires against each other, and instead doing what is best for my family and my church. For the most part, right now that means not writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I put it to Jaimie a while back, at this point in life I have time for one hobby—and only one. That hobby, at this point, is fitness. I run half marathons, and now I do triathlons (first one coming up in 10 days!). That takes up a non-trivial amount of time every week. It helps me in the other areas of my life, to be sure: it helps me be less physically tired, improves my focus in school and work, and serves to maintain my health. Nonetheless, it is hobby-like and it takes a substantial amount of time every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So right now, I write a great deal less than I want, and a great deal less than I did in college or early in our marriage. I miss the days when I had time to work on poetry for hours at a stretch, or simply to muse for a few thousand words. But it is far more important for me to spend time with Ellie and Kate than it is to write poetry, or to compose music, right now. Lord willing, I have 55–60 years ahead of me. Of those years, they will be close only another 15–20, and they will be the age they are today &lt;em&gt;only for today&lt;/em&gt;. As much as writing and composing and hobby programming all look appealing to me, and as much as those really are good expressions of the ways God has gifted me, focusing on them would not be the most &lt;em&gt;faithful&lt;/em&gt; use of my time—not today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that writing and composing and developing interesting software are not important. Rather: they &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; good and valuable things. But they are things to focus on at other times in life. As fast as this life goes, and I am increasingly aware that it goes quickly indeed, I can expect in the ordinary course of things to have &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; years available for those things. I can exercise my gifts faithfully in the right time and season. Today, I can learn to love my little girls well, invest deeply in their lives, and savor moments that will never come back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of all, I must remind myself that teaching and shaping them is easily the most significant thing I will ever do. Should I write an essay that persuaded a thousand people to change their views on the arts, or to adopt a better view of the church, still my impact on two little lives would be more important. If I can point them faithfully to Christ and help them learn to walk faithfully with him as healthy members of his body, that will be a good life to have lived. Everything else is icing on the cake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Icing is good, for the record. Sometimes, in these sorts of posts, we can mistake &lt;em&gt;relative importance&lt;/em&gt; for &lt;em&gt;absolute importance&lt;/em&gt;. I should, at various times in my life, make sure to exercise the good gifts God has given me in ways appropriate to that time and context. Right now, that means continuing to write, but less frequently. In the future, it will mean something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And all of this must stand in the context of resurrection hope. Too often, I live—too often, we &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; live—as though the next 60 years are all we may expect, the only time for writing and composing and so on. But it is not. I look forward to endless ages of creativity, exercising those gifts &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; fully than I am able now. So: Lord Jesus, come soon. And in the meantime, may I be faithful in each season to do as well as I can.&lt;/p&gt;

Barber and Robert A. Peterson’s &lt;em&gt;Life Everlasting&lt;/em&gt; is an introductory look at the Biblical picture of heaven and eschatological hope. The authors, noting the prevalence of near-death experience accounts, the fascination many Christians evince with life after death, and the many misunderstandings about heaven and Christian hope that are prevalent among both Christians and non-Christians, aim to reset the focus of the discussion on what the Bible has to say about these matters. After a brief introduction, they examine in turn the ideas of Creation, Rest, Kingdom, Presence, and Glory through the lens of a Creation-Fall-Redemption-Restoration reading of Scripture. For each major idea they survey, they supply a chapter examining how how things are meant to be (Creation), how they have been distorted (Fall), how Christ’s work ushers in renewal (Redemption), and how believers may expect and hope them to turn out in the end (Restoration). In each pair of chapters, they spend the bulk of their time surveying (albeit very briefly) some of the biblical material on the topic under consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barber and Peterson open with a section on Creation in order to argue that central and essential to Christian hope—and too often overlooked or misunderstood—is the idea of physical resurrection. In their opening section, they trace out this idea effectively and substantively. However, though they continue to give nods to the idea of the resurrection’s importance through the remainder of the book, they largely fall prey to one of the traps they decry in their intro: they focus almost entirely on &lt;em&gt;spiritual&lt;/em&gt; realities to the exclusion of &lt;em&gt;physical&lt;/em&gt; realities. As a result their analysis of the ideas of rest, kingdom, and presence are all substantially impoverished in various ways, and even their (better) treatment of Glory leaves a bit to be desired. It is not that what they say is incorrect; they present the Biblical picture of those spiritual elements of future hope well and fairly compellingly (albeit a bit blandly). Rather, it is that in each case, they simply fail to address key and essential repercussions of the embodied nature of Christian hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their discussion of rest, the authors repeatedly emphasize their view that the Christian’s hope of rest is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; in fact physical, but rather is simply a matter of experiencing fellowship with God. They note that Christians will rest from their labors, and give a token nod to the idea that they may continuing doing something or other in the new heavens and new earth, but spend no time whatsoever considering how that informs believers’ view of vocation in the present. Though they acknowledge that labor in the Garden was good, they say little about the continuing goodness of work, and skip almost entirely over the prospect of the restoration of work to a human &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; in the coming age. Besides failing to account for the full biblical narrative, this has significant pastoral consequences. The fallen world alternately presents believers with the two dangers of resenting all work or of idolizing it. The answer to these solutions is not to look to a merely spiritual hope of rest, but rather to recognize that the shape of work must be understood in light of its creation and its promised eschatological renewal. Christians today are members of an outpost of the eschatological age in the here and now; believers are citizens of the future age, attempting to live out the realities of the age to come even as the world around remains broken and unrestored. Christians’ approach to their work, then, should reflect the inherent goodness of generative activity, the hope that their labors will produce real reward in the age to come, and a God-honoring delight in the goodness of that work. Barber and Peterson neatly lay the groundwork for this, but fail to do anything with that groundwork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They similarly focus entirely on spiritualized visions of &lt;em&gt;kingdom&lt;/em&gt;. While they acknowledge that the kingdom will be in the new heavens and new earth, they spend no time whatsoever on the implications of this for justice, reconciliation, or the healing of the nations—despite the fact that these are all clearly taught, and at great length, in the pages of Scripture. The consummation of God’s reign in his human agents (and specifically Jesus Christ) does have enormous spiritual implications, and Barber and Peterson’s point that Satan and his forces will be defeated and the kingdom at peace at last is well-taken. However, the Biblical pictures of the kingdom include far more than the end of deception and death; it entails the kingdoms of the world having become the kingdom of Christ, and the nations living in harmony with each other. It includes ethnic reconciliation, peace and harmony throughout the earth, the end of economic oppression, and true justice for everyone. These are not merely the concerns of this generation; they are themes that run throughout the pages of the Bible, from Jeremianic condemnations of Israelite failure to practice justice to Paul’s rebuke of ethnic divisions in the early church. No picture of the coming kingdom that misses these elements is either Biblically faithful or pastorally appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addressing &lt;em&gt;presence&lt;/em&gt;, Barber and Peterson once again do good preparatory work but then fail to capitalize on it. Their discussion of how God’s people originally experienced his presence nicely captures the reality that God would come and walk in the Garden of Eden: he was in some mysterious way physically present with them. However, as in the other sections, Barber and Peterson turn primarily to spiritual concerns after their introduction, and their discussion of restoration never even mentions on the reality of Christ’s everlasting incarnation. Still less does it derive from that one of the great hopes of the Christian life: that believers will &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; God. Christians will be able to converse with the incarnate Son, and his humanity will forever be paradigmatic for all other resurrected saints. The resurrected Messiah figures centrally in the New Testament and especially John’s vision; it is astounding that he should be set aside for a spiritualizing discussion that minimizes the physical reality of the new Jerusalem (even if that discussion is largely accurate in its description of the intent of the “new Jerusalem” sequence in Revelation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gladly, the authors’ treatment of &lt;em&gt;glory&lt;/em&gt; does a little better, as they devote some time to the goodness and attributes of the resurrected body. Unsurprisingly, though, given the trajectory of the rest of the book, that discussion is soon set aside for a discussion about the nature of heavenly rewards (one that ultimately concludes that there are no tangible heavenly rewards whatsoever!). This seems a fitting summary of the book’s weaknesses in this area: when the authors &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; address the resurrection directly, it is largely on target—but they too rarely address the resurrection; even more rarely do they trace out its implications for future hope, and still less its impact on life in the time between the times. This failure to consider or apply the promise of physical resurrection and cosmic restoration in areas that are both Biblically significant and pastorally urgent makes the book much less valuable than it might otherwise be.&lt;/p&gt;

I came up with a &lt;em&gt;working&lt;/em&gt; solution, and the site performs all right, most of the time. However, our goal as developers shouldn’t be “all right, most of the time.” It should be “really well, all the time.” A big part of what I did wrong came from the bad advice I found in reading up on the issue along the way. This is my shot at helping you, dear reader, avoid making the same mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="the-challenge" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The challenge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When building a client-side application, we need to get the data for each view so that we can render it. In the case of HolyBible.com, that means everything from actual Bible text to study Bible notes, about pages, etc. The question is &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to do this: we need to be able to load an actual page from our server, and we need a way to request data (rather than whole pages) from the server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(More experienced developers already know where this is going: that last sentence there has the key to this whole thing. I know. But the internet &lt;em&gt;doesn’t.&lt;/em&gt; I learned this the hard way.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="the-mistake" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The mistake&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the mistake I made: I built the Bible data API as (essentially) a &lt;em&gt;single&lt;/em&gt; endpoint. When I went looking for advice on how to build this in Angular and Node/Express, every single tutorial or blog post I found outlined the same basic solution: routes for your data endpoints, and catch-all route that returns the basic frame page for everything else. So, for HolyBible.com, that would come out with route matchers for e.g. &lt;code&gt;/data/gen.1.1&lt;/code&gt;, and for any other specific routes needed (for other views, static resources, etc.), with a default behavior of just dropping a static, basically empty template at the catchall &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; route. Then, once the application has loaded, it can inspect the URL and load the relevant data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This works. It’s exactly what I did on HolyBible.com, in fact. But it’s &lt;em&gt;slow&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong: the time until the initial page load is actually relatively quick (though I plan to improve it substantially over the next couple months). The real problem is that the initial page load &lt;em&gt;doesn’t include any content&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;hate&lt;/em&gt; this. That’s why people are on the site: not to see my neat skills with JavaScript, just to read the Bible. And they have to wait, because once the page &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; load, Angular has to spin up the full application, see what content &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; have been loaded, and request it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="the-solution" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The solution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t write &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; API. Write &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt;. They should be structured nearly identically, but one of them will be a &lt;em&gt;page&lt;/em&gt; API endpoint, and one will be a &lt;em&gt;data&lt;/em&gt; API endpoint. In the context of HolyBible.com, here’s how that would play out.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; One endpoint would be based purely on the standard URL, something like &lt;code&gt;holybible.com/jhn.3.16&lt;/code&gt;. The other would be to retrieve a set of &lt;em&gt;data&lt;/em&gt; associated with a given address, like &lt;code&gt;holybible.com/data/jhn.3.16&lt;/code&gt;. This is only a little different from the approach suggested above, but that small difference matters—in fact, it matters a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of having the &lt;code&gt;/jhn.3.16&lt;/code&gt; route get handled by a catchall &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; route on the back end, it gets its own API endpoint, which looks for URLS of this shape and hands back a full page. That API endpoint is responsible to actually render the content of the page appropriately—in this case, with something like the whole chapter of John 3.&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;That&lt;/em&gt; gets handed back to the browser, so the very first thing the user sees is not a blank page while the JavaScript framework spins up and requests data, but rather &lt;em&gt;the Bible text they asked for in the first place&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the JavaScript framework &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; spin up, and load any required session data, etc. and start managing the UI like normal. Once we get to this point, the framework can go ahead and request a data payload from the &lt;code&gt;/data/&amp;lt;reference&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; endpoint. So, for example, if there is a navigation control on the page (as on HolyBible.com and indeed most sites), clicking to navigate to Job 14 could, instead of requesting &lt;code&gt;/job.14.4&lt;/code&gt;, fetch the data from the other endpoint by running an AJAX request to &lt;code&gt;/data/job.14.4&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The backend thus supplies &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; a &lt;code&gt;/&amp;lt;resource&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;code&gt;/data/&amp;lt;resource&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; route. This might seem redundant, but we’ve just seen why it isn’t, Moreover, if you have any logic that needs to be in place—in our example here, a Bible reference parser, for example, to decide what content should be supplied—you can easily reuse it between the two routes. The differences is simply in the form of the data returned: is it a fully-rendered template, or just the data?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="so-what" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So what?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach has two big advantages over the catch-all approach that was frequently recommended in e.g. Angular SPA tutorials I read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s &lt;em&gt;progressive enhancement&lt;/em&gt;. If the JavaScript fails, or the user has it disabled, or it fails to load because it’s loaded asynchronously, the user still gets the page they asked for. Moreover, as long as the page content is build carefully (links built appropriately for other content, and so on), the entire application could continue to work even if the JavaScript &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; becomes available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s &lt;em&gt;performant&lt;/em&gt;. Loading the content this way will be &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; faster than the standard approach recommended for single-page apps. As noted above, it gets the content to the user immediately, then lets the JavaScript UI bits come into play. Since future page loads can take advantage of both caching and smaller data payloads, the whole thing can actually be faster than either a pure client-side &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; a pure server-side approach. That is, once the client-side application is running, it can just update its views with data delivered via AJAX, rather than reloading the whole page. But &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; that, the user doesn’t have to wait to see something useful until the JavaScript framework spins up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not often an approach gives you progressive enhancement and actually increases the performance of an application, but this one does. Better yet, you can apply this in just about any framework: it’s equally applicable to AngularJS with ExpressJS, Backbone with Rails, Ember with Django, Aurelia with Phoenix, or any other combination you come up with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="refs" class="references"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section class="footnotes"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note: this is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the actual API structure of HolyBible.com, or even particularly close to it. Remember, I learned everything I’m writing here by doing it &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;a href="#fnref1"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or possibly a section which constitutes a semantic block of data. I have some thoughts on chunking Bible data semantically rather than by chapter and verse for this kind of thing. That’s another post for another day, though.&lt;a href="#fnref2"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I broadly agree with the critique of the libertarian/TP angle on government as essentially an appendage to business. I am &lt;em&gt;by no means&lt;/em&gt; hostile to the government in general or in principle, nor even to &lt;em&gt;spying&lt;/em&gt;, nor even to warranted (double entendre intended) use of data for law enforcement. The idea that all government is bad is woefully incorrect; it is better to speak of &lt;em&gt;abuses&lt;/em&gt;, either of government or of business or indeed of any sphere exceeding its right domain or acting inappropriately within its domain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a profound and important difference between corporate data collection and federal government data collection: one of them, people accede to directly (though see below); the other they accede to (at best!) indirectly through elected representatives, with whom they may profoundly disagree and against whom they have no recourse (unlike the case of, say, Google or Facebook—one &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; simply stop dealing with them). Whatever information I have granted to a corporation, I have chosen to grant them, and I can stop doing so with future information at any time. I &lt;em&gt;cannot&lt;/em&gt; do so with the NSA, FBI, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;That distinction may be relatively meaningless for most people in practice, given that the terms, means, and consequences of the data collection carried about by corporations are often obscure to the point of incomprehensibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As such, a serious reformation ought to occur in the realm of business and the way that people’s information is handled. Treating information about customers as the primary point of transactional value has significantly deleterious costs on any number of things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this reason, I consistently advocate for and (where possible) choose to use services which are supported by direct payment, rather than by advertising, and so on. This is not always possible, but where it is, we should consider taking that path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, because of the government’s power of coercion—a power not held by corporations, though to be sure they can exercise significant force of a certain sort through legal machinery/chicanery—the collection of metadata by the government does pose a more potent and long-term threat to liberty than that by corporations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As such, people are &lt;em&gt;absolutely right&lt;/em&gt; to be more tolerant of corporate data collection than of federal data collection. That they ought to be less tolerant of corporate data collection by no means suggests that their hostility to unwarranted governmental data collection should be diminished: quite the contrary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, while some of the criticism of the government’s data collection may well be driven by the sorts of corporate interests he suggests, and while much of the opposition from companies like Facebook and Google is indeed hypocritical, the criticism is still warranted. The NSA has clearly and repeatedly overstepped even the extremely wide bounds granted it by the Patriot Act, and the Patriot Act itself licensed behavior that should be horrifying to people concerned with the long-term effects of mass surveillance on governance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

I got stuck and confused for quite a while on getting the interface to a given function to build correctly, and along the way had to try to understand the &lt;code&gt;from_param&lt;/code&gt; class method. The official docs are… fine… but the examples provided don’t cover the most common/basic use case: defining a simple, &lt;em&gt;non-ctypes&lt;/em&gt; data type as an argument to a DLL-exported function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s say you have a C function exported from a DLL; for convenience we’ll make it something rather silly but easy to understand:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="c"&gt;&lt;code&gt;/** my_exported.h */
#include &amp;quot;exports.h&amp;quot;

typedef enum {
    ZERO,
    ONE,
    TWO
} MyEnum;

MY_API int getAnEnumValue(MyEnum anEnum);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implementation just gives back the integer value of the function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="c"&gt;&lt;code&gt;int getAnEnumValue(MyEnum anEnum) {
    return (int)anEnum;
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said, a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; silly example. Note that you don’t technically need the &lt;code&gt;(int)&lt;/code&gt; cast there; I’ve just put it in to be explicit about what we’re doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How would we use this from Python? Assuming we have a DLL named &lt;code&gt;my_dll&lt;/code&gt; which exports the &lt;code&gt;getAnEnumValue&lt;/code&gt; function, we’d load it up roughly like this:&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;import ctypes as c

my_dll = c.cdll.LoadLibrary(&amp;#39;my_dll&amp;#39;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, we bind to the function like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;get_an_enum_value = my_dll.getAnEnumValue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, when you do this, you usually also supply the &lt;code&gt;argtypes&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;restype&lt;/code&gt; values for these functions. If you’re like me, you’d think, “Oh, an enum—a perfect opportunity to use the &lt;code&gt;Enum&lt;/code&gt; type in Python 3.4+!” and then you’d do something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;import ctypes as c
from enum import IntEnum

class MyEnum(IntEnum):
    ZERO = 0
    ONE = 1
    TWO = 2

my_dll = c.cdll.LoadLibrary(&amp;#39;my_dll&amp;#39;)
get_an_enum_value = my_dll.getAnEnumValue
get_an_enum_value.argtypes = [MyEnum]
get_an_enum_value.restype = c.c_int&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That seems sensible enough, but as it is, it won’t work: you’ll get an error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;TypeError: item 1 in _argtypes_ has no from_param method&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is because &lt;code&gt;argtypes&lt;/code&gt; values &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to be either existing &lt;code&gt;ctypes&lt;/code&gt; types&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or supply either:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a &lt;code&gt;from_param&lt;/code&gt; classmethod, or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an &lt;code&gt;_as_parameter_&lt;/code&gt; attribute&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use &lt;code&gt;ctypes.Structure&lt;/code&gt; subclasses natively that way, because the &lt;code&gt;Structure&lt;/code&gt; class supplies its &lt;code&gt;from_param&lt;/code&gt; classmethod. The same is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; true of our custom enum class, though. As the docs put it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have defined your own classes which you pass to function calls, you have to implement a &lt;code&gt;from_param()&lt;/code&gt; class method for them to be able to use them in the argtypes sequence. The &lt;code&gt;from_param()&lt;/code&gt; class method receives the Python object passed to the function call, it should do a typecheck or whatever is needed to make sure this object is acceptable, and then return the object itself, its &lt;code&gt;_as_parameter_&lt;/code&gt; attribute, or whatever you want to pass as the C function argument in this case. Again, the result should be an integer, string, bytes, a &lt;code&gt;ctypes&lt;/code&gt; instance, or an object with an &lt;code&gt;_as_parameter_&lt;/code&gt; attribute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, to make the enum type work, we need to add a &lt;code&gt;from_param&lt;/code&gt; class method or an &lt;code&gt;_as_parameter_&lt;/code&gt; attribute to it. Thus, either of these options will work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;class MyEnum(IntEnum):
    ZERO = 0
    ONE = 1
    TWO = 2

    # Option 1: set the _as_parameter value at construction.
    def __init__(self, value):
        self._as_parameter = int(value)

    # Option 2: define the class method `from_param`.
    @classmethod
    def from_param(cls, obj):
        return int(obj)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the constructor-based option, the &lt;code&gt;value&lt;/code&gt; argument to the constructor is the value of the &lt;code&gt;Enum&lt;/code&gt; instance. Since the value of anan &lt;code&gt;IntEnum&lt;/code&gt; is always the same as the integer to whcih it is bound, we can just return &lt;code&gt;int(value)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;from_param&lt;/code&gt; approach works a little differently, but with the same results. The &lt;code&gt;obj&lt;/code&gt; argument to the &lt;code&gt;from_param&lt;/code&gt; method is the object instance, in this case the enumerated value itself. &lt;em&gt;Any&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;Enum&lt;/code&gt; with an integer value can be directly cast to &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; (though it is possible for &lt;code&gt;Enum&lt;/code&gt; instances to have other values, so be careful), and since we have an &lt;code&gt;IntEnum&lt;/code&gt; here, we can again just return &lt;code&gt;int(obj)&lt;/code&gt; directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s say we want to apply this pattern to more than a single &lt;code&gt;IntEnum&lt;/code&gt; class, because our C code defines more than one enumeration. Extracting it to be common functionality is simple enough: just create a class that implements the class method, and inherit from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;class CtypesEnum(IntEnum):
    &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;A ctypes-compatible IntEnum superclass.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;
    @classmethod
    def from_param(cls, obj):
        return int(obj)


class MyEnum(CtypesEnum):
    ZERO = 0
    ONE = 1
    TWO = 2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our final (working!) Python code, then, would be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Import the standard library dependencies
import ctypes as c
from enum import IntEnum


# Define the types we need.
class CtypesEnum(IntEnum):
    &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;A ctypes-compatible IntEnum superclass.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;
    @classmethod
    def from_param(cls, obj):
        return int(obj)


class MyEnum(CtypesEnum):
    ZERO = 0
    ONE = 1
    TWO = 2


# Load the DLL and configure the function call.
my_dll = c.cdll.LoadLibrary(&amp;#39;my_dll&amp;#39;)
get_an_enum_value = my_dll.getAnEnumValue
get_an_enum_value.argtypes = [MyEnum]
get_an_enum_value.restype = c.c_int

# Demonstrate that it works.
print(get_an_enum_value(MyEnum.TWO))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The output will be &lt;code&gt;2&lt;/code&gt;, just as you’d expect!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important note: The type definition we’ve provided here will work for &lt;code&gt;argtypes&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;restype&lt;/code&gt; assignments, but &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; as one of the members of a custom &lt;code&gt;ctypes.Structure&lt;/code&gt; type’s &lt;code&gt;_fields_&lt;/code&gt; value. (Discussing how you’d go about doing that is beyond the scope of this post; the most direct approach is just to use a &lt;code&gt;ctypes.c_int&lt;/code&gt; and note that it is intended to be used with a given &lt;code&gt;IntEnum&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;CtypesEnum&lt;/code&gt; type.)&lt;/p&gt;

Hellerman argues that the health of the church depends on embracing what he describes as a strong-group culture mentality. Based on insights from sociology, he maintains that the “family” language of Scripture, and especially that of the New Testament, should lead believers to embrace the same kind of cultural norms that characterized families in the ancient Mediterranean world where the Bible was written. He first explains how that strong-group culture works, contrasting it with the individualistic (or “weak-group”) culture of the west: individual desires are sublimated to those of the group, and decisions are made both within the context of the group and with the good of the group foremost. He then defends the idea that this was how the New Testament church community was structured, before turning to a general discussion of how the practice of the Western church might need to change to accommodate this kind of cultural shift. In this practical turn, Hellerman considers a number of cases studies for how this has played out in his experience, as well as the implications for leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Hellerman’s argument has much to recommend it on the whole, his treatment of the Bible’s relationship to strong- and weak-group cultures leaves a great deal to be desired. Granted that the Bible clearly rejects the kind of radical individualism that characterizes contemporary evangelicalism, and granted further that Hellerman rightly emphasizes the communal and familial language of the New Testament in particular, nonetheless he substantially overstates the case for “strong-group” communities, and in doing so partly undermines an otherwise strong and helpful book. Hellerman repeatedly argues that the Bible clearly and unabashedly appropriates and affirms the strong-group culture of the surrounding world. This is the thesis with which he opens the book, and he dedicates the first half of the book to defending it from the pages of Scripture and the early years of church history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Hellerman’s thesis cannot be sustained—at least, not as he presents it. Scripture does appropriate at times from the strong-group ideas of the surrounding culture at times, but it never does so unreservedly, and it often corrects those ideas. First, while Hellerman argues repeatedly and at great length that the dominant understanding of group identity and especially family from the surrounding culture presented patrilineal family groups as primary, and sibling identity as trumping all others, including those from marriage, God rejects that approach to the family itself from the earliest pages of Scripture. Very much &lt;em&gt;unlike&lt;/em&gt; the culture Hellerman praises, with its prioritizing of blood families over a spouse, Genesis clarifies that the pattern for God’s people is that the new relationship formed in marriage takes first place (Gen. 2:24; cf. Eph. 5:31). Likewise, many of the very passages that Hellerman cites as evidence for the strength of the new community Jesus formed among his followers—and especially the most challenging passages where Jesus speaks of hating father and mother and siblings for his sake—implicitly undermine the surrounding culture’s understanding of community and systems. Hellerman rightly sees that these passages emphasized the commitment the new Christ-followers were to have to the eschatological community; he misses the inherent critique of the existing structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same pattern plays out in Hellerman’s readings of Acts, the Epistles, and early church history. Regarding Acts, for example, he asserts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The radical discipline Ananias and Sapphira experienced at the hand of God demonstrates that the collectivist ‘group comes first’ conviction constitutes a central principle for New Testament social ethics. To lie about this aspect of discipleship is to undermine the very foundation for the community God is building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, as the passage itself makes clear, their sin was &lt;em&gt;lying to the Holy Spirit&lt;/em&gt;. The issue of communal responsibility was irrelevant—except, perhaps, insofar as it provoked them to act in a way that would garner group approval. In his treatment of the Epistles, Hellerman asserts but does not demonstrate that the writers approved of their culture’s view of family. Yes, the early Christians called each other brother and sister; no, they did not necessarily therefore affirm everything their culture meant in that. That the church constitutes a family is clear; that that family should behave in line with the honor-driven, insular fashion of the New Testament world is not. Ancient Mediterranean families would cut off those who stumbled and shamed them; the church gave succor to just those people. Similarly, he takes the consistent testimony to Christian love in the history of the early church as evidence for his theme. In fact, many of the examples he cites serve to demonstrate just how broken the surrounding strong-group cultures were, and how the church thrived by forging a &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; way. In all of this, Hellerman repeatedly fails to acknowledge how thoroughly the work of God has been a work of &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; the group and the individual. Both Old or New Testament resound with stories of personal success and failure side by side with those of God’s people. The Biblical picture is &lt;em&gt;both-and&lt;/em&gt;: individuals mutually serving each other and giving themselves up for each other, but not in the process losing their individuality or the unique insight and vision God has given them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it is clear that Hellerman’s thesis drives his exegesis—he never even considers evidence that might right contrary to his thesis. This is too bad. Hellerman’s claim that the Western church needs a healthy dose of strong-group thinking does not stand or fall with the idea that strong-group culture is God’s preferred culture. Indeed, his argument would have been much stronger had he acknowledged the ways that God’s new culture takes the best of strong-group culture (as it does the best of weak-group culture!) and forms it into something new and better. Indeed, the Western church &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; need to retreat from its comfort in highly individualistic, weak-group cultures. American evangelicals have a great deal to learn from strong-group cultures—whether those in the pages of the New Testament, or those of many Majority World cultures. Recovery of the kinds of values Hellerman outlines, and their practical application, will indeed be necessary for thriving and healthy churches. But Hellerman’s approach fails to take seriously the ways in which &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; human cultures are broken, strong- and weak-group alike. Hellerman knows the weaknesses of weak-group cultures quite well; whether he has ever seen the failings of strong-group cultures up close seems doubtful given his lavish praise of those cultures and how little good he has to say of weak-group cultures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do we need to model the world using abstractions invented for pencil and paper? Can we solve quantitative problems &lt;strong&gt;without manipulating symbols&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Answer: exploring new approaches like this is &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt;—but throwing out patterns that have worked for millennia is… unwise.&lt;/p&gt;

What I found was not only a bunch of interesting content—though there was certainly plenty of that, and props to the Logos/Faithlife people for putting on a great event—but also an awful lot of people &lt;em&gt;a lot like me&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those of you who know me well know this is rare. Finding people who share &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; of my primary interests &lt;em&gt;and approach it the same way I do&lt;/em&gt; is relatively rare. Finding people who share an interest is not especially hard, but that qualification is extraordinarily important: I know lots of people interested in programming, and lots of people interested in theology, and not many at all who approach either the same way I do. Finding people who are interested in both software &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; theology (still less also music and linguistics and so on) has been so rare as to be a point of quiet but significant and ongoing frustration in my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then I went to BibleTech, and met a lot of amazing people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was reflecting on the experience today—thinking about why I’ve so deeply enjoyed not only the conference itself but &lt;a href="//bibletechnology-slack.herokuapp.com/"&gt;the community&lt;/a&gt; that has sprung out of it—I realized: &lt;em&gt;These are my people.&lt;/em&gt; They share a passion for software development, theology, linguistics, and in many cases even music. There may not be many of us in the world, but a substantial number were assembled in Seattle April 30–May 1, 2015. That’s no small thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no idea what the future holds for me—whether it will continue to include writing software for the Bible specifically or not—but I &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; say that this phase of my life has been enormously beneficial in this one way if in no others. It is nice to find kindred spirits in the world, and to know that, even if I am pretty strange, there are other strange people out there, too, and that we can keep working in our strange ways to make the Word of God more available and more useful to people every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good work, BibleTech.&lt;/p&gt;

As such, I’ve experimented off and on over the last few years with the best workflow, and have settled down with a set of tools that is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; effective and efficient for me. I’m sure I’m not the only one who’s had to wrestle with some of the issues particular to this toolchain, and I know that information like this can be valuable especially for people just starting off, so I thought I would document it all in one place.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: when talking about a given program, I will italicize it, like &lt;em&gt;brew&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;git&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;python&lt;/em&gt;. When talking about things to type, I will make them a code block like &lt;code&gt;git clone &amp;lt;a repository&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. For any extended samples, I will make them full-on code blocks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;import re

def a_neat_function():
    my_string = &amp;quot;Isn&amp;#39;t it cool?&amp;quot;
    if re.match(r&amp;quot;i\w+&amp;quot;, my_string, flags=re.I):
        print(my_string)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main tools I use are: a good text editor (I like all of &lt;a href="//www.sublimetext.com"&gt;Sublime Text&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="//atom.io"&gt;Atom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="//github.com/textmate/textmate"&gt;TextMate&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="//chocolatapp.com"&gt;Chocolat&lt;/a&gt;; each has its own strengths and weaknesses) or sometimes &lt;a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/"&gt;a full IDE&lt;/a&gt;, version control software (I appreciate and use both &lt;a href="http://www.git-scm.com"&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com"&gt;Mercurial&lt;/a&gt;), and three dedicated tools to which the rest of this post is devoted: &lt;em&gt;pyenv&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;pip&lt;/em&gt;, and virtual environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone is going to have their own preferences for version control tools and an editor; but the recommendations I make regarding Python installations, package management, and workspaces/virtual environments should be fairly standard for anyone doing Python development on a Unix-like system in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="python-proper" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Python Proper&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First up: Python itself. OS X ships with a built-in copy of Python 2; in the latest version of Yosemite, it’s running Python 2.7.6. The latest version of Python 2 is 2.7.9, so that isn’t &lt;em&gt;terribly&lt;/em&gt; far behind—but it is still behind. Moreover, OS X does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; ship with Python 3, and since I do all of my development in Python 3&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I need to install it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="homebrew" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Homebrew&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a long time, I managed all my Python installations with &lt;a href="http://brew.sh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;homebrew&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re not familiar with it, &lt;em&gt;homebrew&lt;/em&gt; is a package manager that lets you installed tools on the command line, similar to what you get from &lt;em&gt;aptitude&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;yum&lt;/em&gt; on Ubuntu or Fedora respectively.&lt;a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; If you’re not using &lt;em&gt;homebrew&lt;/em&gt; yet, I highly recommend it for installing command-line tools. (If you’re not using command-line tools yet, then the rest of this post will either bore you to death, or prove extremely enlightening!) If you haven’t started yet, now’s a good time: &lt;a href="http://brew.sh"&gt;go install it!&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While &lt;em&gt;homebrew&lt;/em&gt; is great for installing and managing packages in general, I can’t say this loud enough: &lt;em&gt;don’t manage Python with homebrew&lt;/em&gt;. It’s finicky, and really isn’t meant for all the things you have to do to manage more than one version of Python at a time.&lt;a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (There’s a reason there’s a whole &lt;a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/share/doc/homebrew/Homebrew-and-Python.md"&gt;troubleshooting section&lt;/a&gt; devoted to it.) If you think it’s crazy that I might want more than one copy of Python installed a time, well… let’s just say I suspect you’ll change your mind after doing a bit more development. (At the most basic, most people will end up wanting both Python 2 and 3 installed, and will want to upgrade them as bug fixes and the like come out.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="pyenv" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;pyenv&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of installing via &lt;em&gt;homebrew&lt;/em&gt;, use it to install &lt;a href="https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv"&gt;&lt;em&gt;pyenv&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and use that to manage your installations. &lt;em&gt;pyenv&lt;/em&gt; is a dedicated tool for managing your “Python environment,” and it excels at that. If you were on a Mac with &lt;em&gt;homebrew&lt;/em&gt; installed, your setup process to add the latest version of Python might look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ brew install pyenv
$ echo &amp;#39;eval &amp;quot;$(pyenv init -)&amp;quot;&amp;#39; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ~.profile
$ source ~/.profile
$ pyenv install 3.4.3&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Line by line, that (a) installs &lt;em&gt;pyenv&lt;/em&gt;, (b) adds a hook to your shell profile,&lt;a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (c) updates your current session using the updated profile, and (d) installs the latest version of Python (as of the time I’m writing this). Now you have a full version of Python 3.4.3 alongside the system install of Python 2.7.6. If you wanted to install 2.7.9, or 2.2.3, or the development version of PyPy3, you could easily do that as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, &lt;em&gt;pyenv&lt;/em&gt; lets you specify which version to use globally (&lt;code&gt;pyenv global &amp;lt;name&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;) and which version to use in a given directory structure (&lt;code&gt;pyenv local &amp;lt;name&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;). So if you prefer to use Python 3 in general, but need to use Python 2 on one project, you can just navigate to the root of that project and set it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ pyenv global 3.4.3
$ cd path/to/my/project
$ pyenv local 2.7.9&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will create a simple plain text file, &lt;code&gt;.python-version&lt;/code&gt;, whose contents will be just &lt;code&gt;2.7.9&lt;/code&gt;—but for everything under &lt;code&gt;path/to/my/project&lt;/code&gt;, typing &lt;code&gt;python&lt;/code&gt; will launch Python 2.7.9, while typing it &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt; that folder will launch Python 3.4.3. (If you want, you can just create the &lt;code&gt;.python-version&lt;/code&gt; file yourself manually and give it the name of a version. There’s nothing special about it all; it’s just the place &lt;code&gt;pyenv&lt;/code&gt; looks to know which Python version to use.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="managing-python-packages" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Managing Python Packages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are four basic approaches to managing Python packages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;installing them manually&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;using a system-level package manager like &lt;em&gt;homebrew&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;yum&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;aptitude&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;using &lt;em&gt;easy_install&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;using &lt;em&gt;pip&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of the time, the right choice is using &lt;em&gt;pip&lt;/em&gt;. Over the last few years, &lt;em&gt;pip&lt;/em&gt; has become the default install tool for Python packages and it now ships natively with it on every platform. Suffice it to say: if you need to install a package, do not install it not with &lt;em&gt;homebrew&lt;/em&gt; (or &lt;em&gt;aptitude&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;yum&lt;/em&gt;). Install it with &lt;em&gt;pip&lt;/em&gt;. It integrates with Python better, it always has access both to the latest versions of Python packages (including those only available in e.g. development repositories on GitHub or Bitbucket or wherever else) and to all previously released versions, and it’s the community’s main tool for the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, occasionally it makes sense to install packages manually by downloading them and running &lt;code&gt;python setup.py install&lt;/code&gt; or to use a system-level package manager. On the other hand, given &lt;em&gt;pip&lt;/em&gt;’s ability to do everything &lt;em&gt;easy_install&lt;/em&gt; does, and its ability to do quite a few more things as well, there really isn’t a time to use &lt;em&gt;easy_install&lt;/em&gt;. Using the language-supplied tools keeps everything playing nicely together. Perhaps just as importantly, it is the only way to make sure everything behaves the way it should when you start using…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="virtual-environments" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Virtual Environments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When working with a variety of different clients, or simply on different projects, it is common not only to end up with different versions of Python but also with different sets of packages or—tricker still!—different versions of the same package required for different projects. Virtual environments provide a solution: they reuse the main Python executable (by creating links on the file system to it), but create isolated “workspaces” for the various packages you might install.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That way, in one workspace, you might have version 1.2 of a package installed, and in another you might have version 3.3 installed—because those are the required dependencies for something &lt;em&gt;else&lt;/em&gt; you’re doing. This isn’t a hypothetical situation. For quite a while with one of my clients, we had pinned a particular version of the Python documentation package we use because it broke our use case after an update—but I still wanted to have the latest version of that tool in my &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; projects. Setting up virtual environments neatly solves that problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="venv-and-virtualenv" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;venv and virtualenv&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have Python 3.3 or later, you have a built-in tool for this called &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;pyvenv&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; if you have Python 3.4 or later, it supports &lt;em&gt;pip&lt;/em&gt; right out of the gate so you don’t have to install it yourself. If you’re on older versions, you can install &lt;a href="https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;virtualenv&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;code&gt;pip install virtualenv&lt;/code&gt;) and get the same basic tooling: &lt;em&gt;pyvenv&lt;/em&gt; was inspired by &lt;em&gt;virtualenv&lt;/em&gt;. Then you can create virtual environments with the &lt;code&gt;pyvenv&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;virtualenv&lt;/code&gt; commands, and use those to isolate different setups from each other. If you haven’t started using virtual environments yet, start now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="pyenv-with-virtualenv" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;pyenv with virtualenv&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know, the similarity of names for &lt;em&gt;pyenv&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;pyvenv&lt;/em&gt; is unfortunate. If it helps, you can call the latter as &lt;code&gt;venv&lt;/code&gt; rather than &lt;code&gt;pyvenv&lt;/code&gt;. But, more importantly, one of the areas &lt;em&gt;pyenv&lt;/em&gt; is much better than &lt;em&gt;homebrew&lt;/em&gt; is its support for managing virtual environments. Install &lt;a href="https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv-virtualenv"&gt;&lt;em&gt;pyenv-virtualenv&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ brew install pyenv-virtualenv
$ echo &amp;#39;eval &amp;quot;$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)&amp;quot;&amp;#39; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ~/.profile&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you’re off to the races: you’ll never have to type &lt;code&gt;pyvenv &amp;lt;path to a virtual environment&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, because instead you can just type &lt;code&gt;pyenv virtualenv &amp;lt;version&amp;gt; &amp;lt;name&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;em&gt;pyenv&lt;/em&gt; will take care of setting it up for you. Even better: all the nice tricks I listed above about setting directory-specific and global preferences for which Python version to use work equally well with virtual environments managed via &lt;em&gt;pyenv&lt;/em&gt;. In other words, you can do something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ pyenv install 2.7.9
$ pyenv install 3.4.3
$ pyenv global 3.4.3
$ pyenv virtualenv 2.7.9 my-virtual-environment
$ cd path/to/my/project
$ pyenv local my-virtual-environment&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;.python-version&lt;/code&gt; file will contain &lt;code&gt;my-virtual-environment&lt;/code&gt;. The Python version will be 2.7.9. The environment will be isolated, just as if you had run &lt;code&gt;pyvenv&lt;/code&gt; to set up a virtual environment. Everything works together beautifully! Moreover, you can easily reuse virtual environments this way, because you can set the &lt;code&gt;local&lt;/code&gt; value in more than one place. For example, I use the same virtual environment for this site and &lt;a href="//www.winningslowly.org/" title="A podcast: taking the long view on technology, religion, ethics, and art."&gt;Winning Slowly&lt;/a&gt;, because they have slightly different site configurations but all the same Python dependencies. Creating it was simple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ pyenv install 3.4.3
$ pyenv virtualenv 3.4.3 pelican
$ cd ~/Sites/chriskrycho.com
$ pyenv local pelican
$ cd ~/Sites/winningslowly.org
$ pyenv local pelican&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I named the virtual environment after &lt;a href="//docs.getpelican.com/"&gt;the tool I use to generate the sites&lt;/a&gt;, and reused it in both sites. Both now have a &lt;code&gt;.python-version&lt;/code&gt; file that reads &lt;code&gt;pelican&lt;/code&gt;. Now, anytime I’m working anywhere under &lt;code&gt;~/Sites/chriskrycho.com&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;~/Sites/winningslowly.org&lt;/code&gt;, I have the same tooling in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="summary" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combination of &lt;em&gt;pip&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;pyenv&lt;/em&gt; and virtual environments makes for a very simple, straightforward process to manage Python environments these days:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install Python versions with &lt;em&gt;pyenv&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install Python packages with &lt;em&gt;pip&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set up virtual environments with &lt;em&gt;pyenv-virtualenv&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you stick to those basic rules, Python itself shouldn’t give you any trouble at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="refs" class="references"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section class="footnotes"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the usual caveats apply, of course: this may or may not work well for you; it’s just what works for me, and I make no claim or warranty on the tools below—they’re working well for &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;, but I don’t maintain them, so if they break, please tell the people who maintain them! Also, because I do nearly all my development on a Mac (I test on Windows, but that’s it), the following is necessarily &lt;em&gt;fairly&lt;/em&gt; specific to OS X. You can readily adapt most of it to Linux, though, or even to a &lt;a href="https://www.cygwin.com"&gt;Cygwin&lt;/a&gt; install on Windows—I do just that when I have cause. But my main tool is a Mac, so that’s what I’ve specialized for.&lt;a href="#fnref1"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lucky me, I know!&lt;a href="#fnref2"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn3"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, I know that those are wrappers around Debian and Arch, and I know about &lt;em&gt;apt-get&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;rpm&lt;/em&gt;. No, that information isn’t especially relevant for the rest of this post.&lt;a href="#fnref3"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn4"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, if you upgrade your Python installation using homebrew and then cleanup the old version (e.g., by running the typical &lt;code&gt;brew update &amp;amp;&amp;amp; brew upgrade &amp;amp;&amp;amp; brew cleanup&lt;/code&gt; sequence)—say, from 3.4.2 to 3.4.3—and you have virtual environments which depended on 3.4.2… well, you’re in a bad spot now. A &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; bad spot. Have fun getting back to a working state!&lt;a href="#fnref4"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can of course drop it directly in &lt;code&gt;.zshrc&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;.bash_profile&lt;/code&gt; or wherever else. &lt;a href="//github.com/chriskrycho/profile"&gt;My setup&lt;/a&gt; puts all common handling in &lt;code&gt;.profile&lt;/code&gt; and runs &lt;code&gt;source .profile&lt;/code&gt; as the first action in any other shell configurations.&lt;a href="#fnref5"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poetry, as I have been arguing throughout this study, is not just a set of techniques for saying impressively what could he said otherwise. Rather, it is a particular way of imagining the world—particular in the double sense that poetry as such has its own logic, its own ways of making connections and engendering implications, and because each system of poetry has certain distinctive semantic thrusts that follow the momentum of its formal dispositions and habits of expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I would like to suggest about the effect of the language of poetry in this [Isa. 1:2–9] and most other Biblical prophecies is that it tends to lift the utterances to a second power of signification, aligning statements that are addressed to a concrete historical situation with an archetypal horizon. The Judean contemporaries of Isaiah the son of Amoz become the archetypes Sodom and Gomorrah in respect to both their collective destiny and their moral character. If one considers, as the metaphors of the poem require one to consider, how God has treated them as beloved sons, then their exploitation of the poor and the helpless in their midst (1:23 and elsewhere), in flagrant violation of God’s commands, becomes a paradigmatic instance of treachery, of man’s… capacity for self-destructive perverseness. In this fashion, a set of messages framed for a particular audience of the eighth century B.C.E. Is not just the transcription of a historical document but continues to speak age after age, inviting members of otherwise very different audiences to read themselves into the text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This essay will demonstrate that the concluding section of Lamentations 3, running from v. 40 to v. 66, constitutes an open-ended, multivocal answer to the question posed in Lamentations 3:39: “Why should a person complain, / a living man concerning his sins?” The poet did not believe Yahweh demanded silence of his people, even in the face of his judgment. Rather, his people were to trust him deeply enough to call out to him, even when all evidence suggested he would not answer. The point will be demonstrated by a close analysis of the structure, verbs, and poetic devices employed throughout the text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="authorship" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Authorship&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lamentations has traditionally been attributed to Jeremiah, but the poems themselves make no claim to authorship whatsoever.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Jeremianic authorship is possible, and a few commentators continue to argue for it as a reasonable assumption.&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; However, while there are commonalities in style and vocabulary between the books of Jeremiah and Lamentations,&lt;a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and no outright contradictions between the two books,&lt;a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; there are also significant differences between them. Jeremiah predicted the destruction of the city and the temple while the author of Lamentations seems surprised by it, and Jeremiah strongly emphasizes the sins of the people while the author of Lamentations hardly mentions them.&lt;a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; These differences in perspective might be the result of the prophet’s experience of the fall of Jerusalem as opposed to merely the anticipation thereof, but more likely whoever composed the book “was familiar with the book of Jeremiah, but had his own vocabulary to express grief over the fall of Jerusalem.”&lt;a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some commentators argue not only against Jeremianic authorship but for multiple authorship.&lt;a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Such a reading is hardly required, however. The suggestion that variation in perspective or even poetic style can &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; be explained by multiple authorship badly underestimates the range of human artistry.&lt;a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Poetic voice is not the same as &lt;em&gt;authorial&lt;/em&gt; voice;&lt;a href="#fn9" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref9"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the multiple voices which appear throughout the book are “poetic vehicles through which the poet speaks throughout”&lt;a href="#fn10" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref10"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; rather than multiple authors arguing for differing theologies. Even if Lamentations is the product of multiple poets, the poems ultimately represent continuity of thought and theology, both individually and collectively.&lt;a href="#fn11" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref11"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Together, they present a multivocal but coherent expression of grief in the face of horrific tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="context" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Context&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;section id="geographical-and-cultural" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Geographical and Cultural&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lamentations was composed in response to the Babylonian destruction of Jerusalem and its temple and the deportation of Judean leadership in 595–587 B.C. However, it is not clear how long after the fall of Jerusalem the poems were composed, nor whether they were composed simultaneously or with some gaps between them. The book was probably composed prior to the rebuilding of the temple in 515 B.C., since the text includes no hint of such a hopeful turn of events,&lt;a href="#fn12" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref12"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; but the author’s imaginative and lyrical skill count for more than his proximity to the events he describes.&lt;a href="#fn13" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref13"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; In any case, the date of composition is largely irrelevant to the interpretation of the text.&lt;a href="#fn14" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref14"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the rest of the Hebrew Bible, Lamentations adopts from but freely adapts genres from the surrounding cultures. Accordingly, it includes elements of Ancient Near East city laments, communal laments, and communal dirges.&lt;a href="#fn15" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref15"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Records of city laments in the greater Mesopotamian region date to the beginning of the second millennium B.C., and the author of Lamentations joined various prophetic writers in the Old Testament in repurposing the form for his theological purposes.&lt;a href="#fn16" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref16"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Whereas most city-laments appear to have been created for rededications of temples and thus include the imagery of a god’s return to the temple, Yahweh is conspicuously absent and his temple in ruins throughout Lamentations.&lt;a href="#fn17" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref17"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Moreover, the theology of Lamentations differs significantly from the city-laments. Though the poet gives full voice to doubt and anger towards Yahweh throughout the book, he ultimately places moral responsibility not on Yahweh but on the sinning people of Jerusalem, very much unlike the anti-theodic bent of other city laments.&lt;a href="#fn18" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref18"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The text mingles “penitence &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; protest, confession &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; lament.”&lt;a href="#fn19" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref19"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="literary" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Literary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book consists of five poems, each sharing the same basic acrostic structure. Chapters 1, 2, and 4 each have twenty-two multi-line verses, each beginning with a consecutive letter of the Hebrew alphabet.&lt;a href="#fn20" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref20"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Chapter 3 changes the pattern, devoting three single-line verses to each letter. Finally, chapter 5 consists of another twenty-two verses of poetry, but does not include the acrostic lettering scheme. The acrostics draw the reader forward through the text&lt;a href="#fn21" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref21"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and express a sense of completion at their conclusion: grief has been fully sounded and emotional and theological catharsis experienced.&lt;a href="#fn22" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref22"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The poet &lt;em&gt;imposes&lt;/em&gt; order on a world in chaos by choosing to “express the inexpressible… [in poems] whose controlling structural device is the very letters that signify and give shape to language.”&lt;a href="#fn23" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref23"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Moreover, the repetition of letters, as of words and ideas throughout the poem, “introduces the indispensable element of &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt;: reflection and re-reflection on the meaning of the aesthetic message.”&lt;a href="#fn24" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref24"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; At the same time, the frequent use of enjambment both works with the acrostic to propel the reader forward through the text&lt;a href="#fn25" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref25"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and undermines the poetry’s regularity, allowing the poet to control the pace of the poem “without relying on emplottment [sic] or even strong characterization.”&lt;a href="#fn26" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref26"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; These large-scale poetic devices together shape not only the structure but also the message of the poetry: lines give different senses when read alone than when read in their acrostic strophe, and different again when read in the full sequence.&lt;a href="#fn27" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref27"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; They ultimately “draw the reader into a variety of responses… [not] one particular response.”&lt;a href="#fn28" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref28"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lamentations 3 is the theological and poetic center of the book.&lt;a href="#fn29" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref29"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Although some modern commentators hesitate to affirm the centrality of the chapter because of a tendency to downplay the lament elsewhere in the book,&lt;a href="#fn30" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref30"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; there are good reasons to take this view. Structurally, the center is often important to Hebrew poetry, and while that importance can be overstated, the placement of the poem here should not be ignored—especially when its poetry and content differ from the others in such a notable way.&lt;a href="#fn31" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref31"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The increased repetition heightens the effect and draws attention to the content of the poetry.&lt;a href="#fn32" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref32"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The shorter lines are visually and aurally arresting. The chapter includes theodic content and, at times, a hopeful tone—kinds of content absent in the rest of the poems. It is also the only poem in which words are attributed to Yahweh.&lt;a href="#fn33" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref33"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The literary and theological emphasis the poet placed on this chapter is not a reason to ignore the message of the other chapters, but neither should it be ignored in interpreting them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chapter has three major sections, though commentators divide them in slightly different ways; the exegesis below analysis assumes the following division. In the first section (vv. 1–18), “the man who has seen affliction” (3:1) laments his individual suffering at God’s hands. The second section (vv. 19–39) emphasizes Yahweh’s covenant love, trustworthy character, and hatred of injustice; it is the most hopeful and theodic passage in the book. In the third section (vv. 40–66), the speaker responds to the theodic ideas outlined in the second with a complex mix of complaint, lament, hope, and imprecation. This concluding turn has led some commentators to suggest the speaker ultimately could not believe the ethical/theodic message,&lt;a href="#fn34" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref34"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or that he was angrily determined to “speak in the face of Yahweh’s silence;”&lt;a href="#fn35" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref35"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;35&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; it has led others to suggest competing authors (see above). But “[the] speaker is not schizophrenic.”&lt;a href="#fn36" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref36"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The same person may simultaneously recognize his own sinful responsibility, trust God, and yet remain long for deliverance from and be troubled by his suffering.&lt;a href="#fn37" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref37"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;37&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Though all of these themes appear scattered throughout the book, Lamentations 3 alone draws them together in a single poem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final section begins in v. 40. Although there are later topical and vocal shifts (especially in v. 42; see below), none are as strong as the one leading the נ-strophe, which is doubly marked. The speaker shifts from general statements about Yahweh to exhortation of the listening community precisely at the transition from the מ-strophe to the נ-strophe. Indeed, given the enjambment across strophe boundaries typical of the final section of the poem,&lt;a href="#fn38" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref38"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;38&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the alignment here clearly indicates a major transition in the poem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="exegesis" class="level1"&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Exegesis&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;section id="we-repent-but-god-has-not-forgiven-us-4051" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;We Repent but God Has Not Forgiven Us (40–51)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speaker has finished his discourse on who Yahweh is and how he acts; now it is time to respond. In light of the preceding declaration of Yahweh’s covenant love and justice, and its “emphasis on confession and penitence”&lt;a href="#fn39" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref39"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;39&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the speaker urges his people to turn and repent. He turns almost immediately to a lengthy lament, however: God has not forgiven. Indeed, the divine warrior has struck down his own people.&lt;a href="#fn40" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref40"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Things seems hopeless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="let-us-repent-4042a" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Let us repent! (40–42a)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Yahweh’s covenant love may be trusted and he judges rightly, and if his people have sinned, they ought to repent. The speaker employs the language of (especially Jeremianic) prophetic exhortation, calling the people to search out and examine their ways and return to Yahweh.&lt;a href="#fn41" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref41"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;41&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Unlike in Jeremiah, though, the speaker includes himself in the call to repentance. The opening verbs of the section are not imperatives but cohortatives (נַחְפְּשָׂ֤ה, נַחְקֹ֔רָה, נָשׁ֖וּבָה). The speaker thus affirms that his and his people’s sin has led to their current condition; they must repent. The imperfect that follows (נִשָּׂ֤א) picks up the force of the preceding cohortatives and continues the exhortation. The language of “hearts with hands” reminds the reader that the repentance required is an act of the whole person: neither merely internal nor merely external.&lt;a href="#fn42" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref42"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;42&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The reference to “God in heaven” does double duty: it marks his authority to forgive, but it also suggests his absence from Zion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="god-is-still-hidden-42b44" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God is still hidden (42b–44)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the following verses, the author begins by confessing sin, then addresses Yahweh, who has not forgiven his people, and who has instead opposed them and hidden himself from their prayers. Israel’s divine warrior-God has now become her enemy.&lt;a href="#fn43" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref43"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;43&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The God whose presence with his people was so often manifest as a cloud&lt;a href="#fn44" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref44"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;44&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has now removed his presence from them with a cloud.&lt;a href="#fn45" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref45"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;45&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The people may confess, but unless Yahweh hears their prayers and answers them, they will remain destitute and hopeless.&lt;a href="#fn46" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref46"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;46&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; In light of the speaker’s confession and the hope expressed in the preceding major section, that Yahweh has not forgiven comes as a surprise, and one intensified dramatically by the poetry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the poetry here is enjambed twice, making it one of the more prominent of the many instances of the poetic device throughout this section of the poem.&lt;a href="#fn47" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref47"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;47&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; First, the poet introduces the address to Yahweh at the end of the נ-strophe instead of at beginning of the ס-strophe. Second, the poet splits the line itself. The first verset continues the thought of the preceding two lines: the people’s repentance before God, in the form of confession: “we have transgressed and rebelled.” The second verset indicates God’s response: “—you have not forgiven!” There is no transition, not even a disjunctive-ו to mark the shift—just a terse pair of statements. Indeed, the effect is so jarring, especially as it leads into the next strophe, that it is tempting to read the entire rest of the poem as accusation against and anger against God.&lt;a href="#fn48" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref48"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Understandable as this reading is—especially as a backlash against the inappropriate suppression of lament among Christians—it is mistaken, as will become clear.&lt;a href="#fn49" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref49"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;49&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The speaker &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; complain here and in what follows, but that is not all he does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the tonal shift between v. 42a and v. 42b, it is possible to read this as the break between the second and third major sections of the book. As noted above, the major discourse boundary is between vv. 39 and 40 instead, where the speaker transitions from exposition to response. There &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a segue here, as the speaker turns his attention from his community to Yahweh, and begins a speech section that runs through v. 47, but this transition is within rather than between sections—from one kind of response to another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="we-are-devastated-by-our-enemies-4547" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;We are devastated by our enemies (45–47)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, the poet employs enjambment to drive the reader into the speaker’s experience of suffering. The transition between the ס- and פ-strophes occurs in v. 46, but already in v. 45 the speaker returns to a theme expressed in the beginning of the chapter as well as in the preceding poems: enemies attacking the people of God. Not only is Yahweh absent from Zion, but he has made her like refuse and waste&lt;a href="#fn50" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref50"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;50&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the midst of the peoples. The tribes he had chosen to be a blessing to the nations (Gen. 12:3; 18:17–19) and set apart as a kingdom of priests (Exod. 19:6; Deut. 17:18) were defilement—things to be thrown out of the camp (cf. Exod. 29:14). Moreover, rather than delivering from enemies, God has brought them against his people.&lt;a href="#fn51" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref51"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;51&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; They have “opened their mouths” against God’s people, an image used in the Wisdom literature both of speaking against someone and of devouring them (Job 29:23; Ps. 5:9; 22:13; 35:21). The climax of the quotation comes in verse 47, a chiasm on two pairs of words which rhyme almost completely.&lt;a href="#fn52" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref52"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;52&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; “Dread and death, devastation and ruination”—this is what Yahweh has accomplished in bringing these enemies against his people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This judgment may not have been unexpected—everything that happened to Jerusalem was expressly the result of a covenant curse—but the circumstances were no less horrific for that. That the judgment was deserved did not lessen the urgency of the speaker’s cry for relief.&lt;a href="#fn53" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref53"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The speaker’s complaint raises the poem’s tension by pitting this lament against the theodic material which precedes it.&lt;a href="#fn54" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref54"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;54&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The speaker may not be shaking his fist at the heavens, but he is certainly complaining loudly and questioning insistently. If Yahweh is loving, faithful, and just, is this judgment not too harsh? At this point, the ethical vision expressed in vv. 19–39 seems lost. Indeed, Miriam Bier and F. W. Dobbs-Allsopp both suggest that the poet &lt;em&gt;wants&lt;/em&gt; to embrace the ethical vision, but that this and the section following demonstrate his inability to do so.&lt;a href="#fn55" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref55"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;55&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Were this the final note of the poem, this analysis would be basically correct. It is not, but things get worse before they get better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="sight-and-salvation-4851" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Sight and salvation (48–51)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speaker echoes the end of v. 47 at the end of v. 48, tying the two together, but shifts in person (from “we” to “I”).&lt;a href="#fn56" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref56"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;56&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The identity of the speaker shifts slightly as a result: he spoke first for himself alone, then exhorted his community, and now stands in solidarity with the community of Zion.&lt;a href="#fn57" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref57"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;57&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The poet connects these verses, from the last line of the פ-strophe through the whole ע-strophe, with the idea of eyes and sight. The poet’s eyes pour out channels of water and flow without ceasing or respite, until Yahweh looks and sees. The poet and his people desperately need Yahweh’s deliverance—and Yahweh remains enthroned in heaven. The poet carefully reiterates the idea suggested in the נ-strophe, delaying the subject of v. 50 to the second half of the line to match the structure of v. 41. The inclusio emphasizes both Yahweh’s sovereignty and his distance from his people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until Yahweh sees—until he stops shrouding himself from his people’s prayers and hears their cries as he did in Exodus 1—the poet’s eyes continue to torment him because of the sad state of the women of the city (v. 51). The final line is curiously expressive: the speaker’s eyes are harsh to his soul—a phrase that has been taken to mean that his eyes literally ache from his crying and that the things he sees torment him.&lt;a href="#fn58" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref58"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;58&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; In fact, the terse language suggests both: in the immediate context, the speaker’s weeping wears him out; more broadly, soul-distressing suffering is nearly omnipresent in these poems. Although he clearly hopes for change, he is no longer addressing Yahweh as of v. 48. He simply states how things are and will remain until God acts: these horrors demand grief. And perhaps Yahweh will hear these tears, even if he seems to have heard nothing else (though nothing in the context or language here suggests these tears are meant to &lt;em&gt;manipulate&lt;/em&gt; God into responding).&lt;a href="#fn59" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref59"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;59&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The section closes without any such response, though; all hope seems lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="deliver-me-from-my-enemies-5266" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Deliver me from my enemies! (52–66)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concluding section is like an individual psalm of lament.&lt;a href="#fn60" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref60"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; It continues the shift begun in v. 19. The chapter (as well as the book) opens with the image of God as a divine warrior fighting against his people, but it concludes with a plea for God to act in line with his character.&lt;a href="#fn61" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref61"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;61&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The speaker hopes that Yahweh will restore his people to covenant unity with him and defend them from their enemies, but refuses to collapse the tension between hope and lament that characterizes the whole poem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="excursus-verb-tense-and-meaning-in-poetry" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Excursus: Verb Tense and Meaning in Poetry&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The verb tense throughout the final section of the poem is a subject of much debate. Commentators differ especially on how to take the mix of perfects and imperfects in vv. 56–58, but significant differences appear beginning as early as v. 52. Some take the verbs to be a mix of past statement and present need or imperative,&lt;a href="#fn62" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref62"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;62&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; but this does not account for the ongoing nature of the speaker’s distress (as indicated by the imperatives in the following section).&lt;a href="#fn63" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref63"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;63&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Others read both the perfects and imperfects as a series of present-tense declarations of faith.&lt;a href="#fn64" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref64"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;64&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; This view rightly captures the sense of present distress, but does not account for the perfect-imperfect alternation and has no basis for distinguishing between these “present-tense” perfects and the ordinary past-tense perfects that precede them. Thus, some suggest that the perfects carry a precative sense, with the imperfects then naturally reading as more imperatives.&lt;a href="#fn65" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref65"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;65&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; In addition to being an unusual and debated syntactical stance, however, this also fails to answer why the poet did not use simple imperatives (as in vv. 59, 63). Even if these verbs simply represent the poet shifting to the perfect-imperfect alternation common to poetry,&lt;a href="#fn66" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref66"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;66&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; this is the only place in the entire final section of the poem where the pattern appears. At the least, it marks the sequence by distinction with the surrounding verses. Thus, none of the proposals satisfactorily account for all the features of the text, though perfect-as-precative is not unreasonable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is possible, of course, that this ambiguity is a function only of modern scholars’ relative ignorance of the language—that native speakers readily took in the meaning of the poetry when Lamentations was written. It is equally plausible, however, that the poet &lt;em&gt;intended&lt;/em&gt; the meaning to remain elusive. This is one of the functions of poetry: to push the boundaries of what language can express and thereby convey feeling and sense beyond the merely literal. The poet in Lamentations employs a wide array of tools to this end in this final section of the poem, including structure (the acrostic), enjambment, rhythm, rhyme and assonance, ellipsis, and allusion. Perhaps the poet wanted audience to wonder: has Yahweh delivered already, spoken already, judged the enemies already—or is the speaker still waiting for Yahweh to hear his prayers? In the world of faith, the answer may be &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt;: the believer may be fully confident that Yahweh’s answer is assured, and still feel no less keenly the fact that experience does not yet bear out that answer. The text is open; it not only allows for but actively invites both readings.&lt;a href="#fn67" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref67"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;67&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; “[Both] past and future signify the ongoing present. The suffering in Lamentations is timeless, and the expression of timelessness seems to have been one of the poet’s goals.”&lt;a href="#fn68" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref68"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;68&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="my-enemies-despair-and-pleading-5255" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;My enemies! Despair and pleading (52–55)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The צ-strophe opens with a stereotyped image of the beleaguered servant of God: the person hunted like a bird (cf. Prov. 6:5; Pss. 11:1, 124:7, 140:5) by those who hated him for no reason (cf. 1 Sam. 19:15, 25:31; Ps. 35:7, 69:5). The strophe continues with a description of the enemies’ depredations. The circuitous language (literally, they put an end to his life, with the action occurring in a pit) conveys the idea of people seeking to end his life by throwing him into a pit and hurling stones at him (cf. Pss. 18:41, 73:27, 94:23).&lt;a href="#fn69" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref69"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;69&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The image is not a dry pit like the ones Joseph and Jeremiah were thrown into (Gen. 38:24; Jer. 38:6). Instead, water went up over the speaker’s head (cf. Ps: 69:1–2). Besides being yet more stock lament imagery,&lt;a href="#fn70" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref70"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;70&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the water language connects this sequence back to the preceding one, even as the focus has changed. So likewise with the “pit” language, whose implied metaphorical use as a substitute for death or the grave&lt;a href="#fn71" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref71"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;71&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is heightened by proximity to v. 47, where it is used precisely that way. The poetry is also enjambed again much as it was at the end of the נ-strophe. The first half of the line in v. 54 continues the complaint theme of the preceding verses, but the latter half begins a recitation of speech to and interaction with Yahweh. The poet carries this theme further as he begins the ק-strophe (v. 55) with the speaker’s having cried out Yahweh’s name from the “deepest pit,” a phrase suggestive of Sheol.&lt;a href="#fn72" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref72"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;72&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing about these verses is particularly striking or unusual next to other laments in the Old Testament, and this is in its own way significant. The speaker has made a small but meaningful change in his language and tone: Yahweh is no longer the enemy but instead the one who might deliver &lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt; the enemies.&lt;a href="#fn73" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref73"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;73&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The turn to traditional, even stereotyped, language of lament and petition signals the speaker’s self-conscious identification with Israel’s history of trusting Yahweh for deliverance. This does not mark the resolution of the trial, but it does undercut the idea that the end of the poem is unrelentingly pessimistic—especially when coupled with the verses that follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="yahweh-hearsmay-yahweh-hear-5658" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Yahweh hears/May Yahweh hear (56–58)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next sequence (continuing the ק-strophe and running into the first line of the ר-strophe) is a striking sequence and is key to understanding the poet’s intent in the final section of the poem. The speaker proclaims Yahweh’s response to his call for help from the edge of death. Per the discussion above, this section is best read as holding together the tensions of past-and-future, actual-and-desired: “you heard my voice” and “hear my voice” (v. 56); “you came on the day I called” and “come on the day I call,” “you said to me” and “say to me” (v. 57); “you strove for my life” and “strive for my life” (v. 58). This is the climax of the final section, the place where the poet’s pleas climax and, more significantly, the only place in the entire book where Yahweh speaks. The words the poet attributes to Yahweh are simple—אַל־תִּירָֽא, “do not fear”—but pack depths into their brief syllables. For the canonically attentive reader, these words immediately call to mind all the places Yahweh tells his people not to fear, and where he inevitably promised his presence and his aid to his people against their enemies.&lt;a href="#fn74" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref74"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;74&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Yet the poet elides the second part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is impossible to take the poet’s intended sense without paying attention to “the way in which the sequence as a whole coheres and interacts, and even to how the poet articulates theological interests.”&lt;a href="#fn75" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref75"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;75&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; This allusion grounds the final segment of the poem in a measure of hope. At the same time, by leaving the promise of Yahweh’s presence merely an allusion, rather than stating it straight out, the poet carefully sustains the tension between &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;not-yet&lt;/em&gt; that drives the conclusion of the poem. Turn the phrases one way, and the speaker is pleading for God to comfort his people by making his presence known; turn them the other and the speaker is proclaiming that this is precisely what God has already done. Both perspectives affirm the community’s need for deliverance and for Yahweh’s presence to return; but the poetry hangs between the two, unresolved. The poet has left both readings possible, perhaps even necessary. Complaint remains,&lt;a href="#fn76" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref76"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;76&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; yet Israel’s hope that Yahweh was and would be with them remains, too.&lt;a href="#fn77" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref77"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;77&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="may-yahweh-judge-the-enemies-5966" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;May Yahweh judge the enemies (59–66)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The poem concludes with the resumption of the speaker’s complaint about the enemies, followed by an imprecatory prayer against them; both the complaint and the imprecation echo the imprecatory psalms.&lt;a href="#fn78" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref78"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;78&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The only two imperatives proper in vv. 40–66 appear here: the speaker pleads with God to judge his case (v. 59) and to observe his enemies’ actions (v. 63). In the complaint, which takes up the final line of the ר-strophe and the entire ש-strophe, he lists out his enemies’ offenses. They sought (unwarranted) vengeance on, connived against, reproached, rose up against, slandered, plotted against, and made a mockery of him (cf. 14:16–17, 23:7).&lt;a href="#fn79" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref79"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;79&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The lines are terse and elliptical, with verbs few and far between; the result reads like a list of charges in a court case, crying out for a verdict.&lt;a href="#fn80" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref80"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;80&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The imprecatory prayer comprises the ת-strophe, where a series of imperfects take up an imperatival force. The only unusual item in the list is the phrase translated “obstinate hearts,” מְגִנַּת, a hapax which appears only here and may be derived from מָגֵן, “shield.” Literally, the speaker asks for Yahweh to give them something like “covering-of-heart”—the idea seems to be hard-heartedness (thus “obstinate”)—so that the enemies will receive the judgment they are due (cf. Exo. 7:3,13).&lt;a href="#fn81" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref81"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;81&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; These imprecations are not merely selfish requests for personal vengeance. Rather, they are a plea for Yahweh to execute divine justice, in line with his character as speaker described it in the middle section of the poem.&lt;a href="#fn82" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref82"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;82&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; It is not that the poet thinks that his proclamation of faith resolved everything. Instead, echoing both the Psalms and Jeremiah,&lt;a href="#fn83" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref83"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;83&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the speaker implores Yahweh for deliverance, confident that God &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; help but desperately needing that ability to become action.&lt;a href="#fn84" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref84"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;84&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="conclusion" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The poem ends on an unresolved note, unlike most of the psalms of imprecation or lament (notable exceptions including Pss. 44, 60).&lt;a href="#fn85" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref85"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;85&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; But this is appropriate to the poet’s aims. He presents not a cheery resolve to act as though everything is better in light of the ethical and theodic vision presented in vv. 19–39, but rather an attempt to apply that vision when circumstances remain unchanged.&lt;a href="#fn86" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref86"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;86&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The result is closure, but not resolution. The acrostic is complete, and the speaker’s grief has been expiated to a degree—but until things are right again, pleading and lament remain. Yahweh may be good and his judgments righteous, but that does not require his people’s silence when he punishes them. To the contrary, it allows them to express their grief and anger in the hope of a merciful and gracious response from their covenant God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reading makes sense of the shape of the poem as a whole. Because of the brighter notes sounded in vv. 19–39, a few commentators take this poem as ending positively.&lt;a href="#fn87" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref87"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;87&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Others take the final 26 verses as a negative response to the (apparently) rhetorical questions posed in vv. 36–39.&lt;a href="#fn88" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref88"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;88&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Neither of these readings does justice to the tension of the poetry. Instead, the poet has played the enjambment card again, at a yet larger level. The final (originally rhetorical) question of the middle section actually received an answer: Why should a man complain about the punishment of his sins? Because even when the judgment was deserved, Yahweh may yet answer, silence the enemy, and draw near to his people. In one sense, he already has; in another, his people are still waiting—and the poet leaves it at that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="application" class="level1"&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Application&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent decades, scholars have applied Lamentations to everything from Freudian grief models&lt;a href="#fn89" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref89"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;89&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to massive national tragedies.&lt;a href="#fn90" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref90"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;90&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The Freudian model of grief has some serious deficiencies—but applications of Lamentations 3 in that context do help people both to articulate their grief and to respond to loss.&lt;a href="#fn91" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref91"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;91&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Application to national tragedies is even more appropriate. The 20th and 21st centuries have seen horrific loss of life; even in largely untouched America, community has disintegrated over the same period. Thus, “the unrelenting relevance of this poetry cries out to be heard and understood.”&lt;a href="#fn92" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref92"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;92&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Reading Lamentations more frequently and deeply will help Western Christians understand the trials of fellow believers enduring persecution for the name of Christ. It will also provide a framework for sympathizing with peoples around the world facing ethnic cleansing or other such horrors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These realities are painful, but they are realities nonetheless. With some of the Psalms, Lamentations addresses human suffering head-on as few other places in Scripture do, pointing the way to a deep, rich, honest, and trusting response to tragedy. The concluding section of chapter 3 is particularly helpful: God sometimes delays his deliverance; repentance does not always lead immediately to restoration; and the enemies of God’s people go on harassing them far longer than seems right. In those moments, people and their pastors have a model to follow: crying out to God as long as his answer remains &lt;em&gt;already-but-not-yet&lt;/em&gt;. Believers ought to spend time reading, meditating on, and praying through these words. Pastors should acquaint themselves with the book deeply so they can minister to their congregants facing trials, and they should preach on it more often to equip their congregations for those trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lamentations 3:40–66 represents an invitation to cry out to God even in the midst of judgment—to believe that he may yet hear. In their hesitation to voice this kind of lament at in the face of life’s travails, many Christians reveal that they do not know their God as well as they ought. “The suffering is, as it were, an affirmation that God is still there and still concerned with the fate of Israel. He may hide his face, but he has not ceased to be Israel’s God.”&lt;a href="#fn93" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref93"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;93&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; If even God’s judgment on Israel was a painful picture of his faithfulness, how much more when he has shared our griefs, borne our sufferings in his own flesh, and been judged to the point of crying out, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” And so he remains open to his people’s cries—for, until suffering ends, lament remains.&lt;/p&gt;

</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chris Krycho</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 25 Apr 2015 14:18:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:www.chriskrycho.com,2015-04-25:2015/2015-04-25-1418.html</guid></item><item><title>An Uncomfortable Fit</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2015/an-uncomfortable-fit.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I grew up in a small, non-denominational, baptistic, charismatic church. Speaking in tongues, the use of private prayer languages, claims to words of knowledge and prophecies, and the expectation of miraculous healings were common. Unfortunately, even granting a continuationist view of the gifts, the church’s practice was never in line with New Testament guidelines for the gifts—no translation of tongues, for example, or requirement that prophecy be fulfilled for the prophet to be judged true. I grew disillusioned with the charismatic approach to the gifts by late high school, and spent several of the following years as a near-cessationist. I remain skeptical of most charismatic churches’ practice of the gifts, but am not a cessationist: I see no compelling exegetical argument for the position. I am especially open to the likelihood of the miraculous gifts in frontier missions context, where they serve to validate the proclamation of the gospel over and above demonic powers worshipped in polytheistic, animistic, and shamanistic cultures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In college, I spent two years attending a fairly traditional Southern Baptist church. For the latter half of my time in college and the three years following, I was a member of a non-demoninational, baptistic, broadly evangelical church with my wife Jaimie. During that time, I remained baptistic, but began to become concerned with the lack of confessional moorings in most baptistic churches (denominational or non-denominational alike). Along the way, I shifted from the non-Calvinistic views held by most charismatics and Baptists to an Edwardsian Calvinism and developed stronger convictions about church polity. Finally, since moving to North Carolina, we have been committed members at First Baptist Church of Durham—a healthy, elder-led, Calvinistic Southern Baptist church that we love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, even here, we find that we are not totally “at home”; it is not quite right to call even Calvinistic Southern Baptists “my tradition”. Indeed, it is perhaps most accurate to say that I have not yet &lt;em&gt;found&lt;/em&gt; my tradition. What I have found instead are points to appreciate in a number of traditions, and an increasing identification (at least from the outside) with many elements of the Presbyterian tradition. A friend once described me as a “Pres-matic Bapt-erian”, and he seems to have been right. I find much to appreciate in the charismatic background from which I sprang, and much to value in the Baptist tradition where I currently live—but at the end of the day, it is only my credobaptist convictions keeping me within the Baptist world, rather than transitioning into Presbyterianism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the charismatic tradition in which I grew up, I learned the value of affections oriented toward Christ. It is not enough to &lt;em&gt;understand&lt;/em&gt; the things of God; we must also love him and one another. Our faith must be true &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; experiential. John reminds us that “this is eternal life, that they know you the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent” (John 17:3) and that “Whoever says he is in the light and hates his brother is still in darkness” (1 John 2:9). Moreover, they emphasized that walking in the Holy Spirit is essential to the healthy Christian life. Though I might now characterize the Spirit’s primary work differently from the church of my childhood, I still affirm whole-heartedly that the Christian life is deeply and profoundly dependent on the Holy Spirit. Paul enjoins us, “But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh…. If we live by the Spirit, let us also keep in step with the Spirit” (Galatians 5:16, 25). Likewise, John reports Jesus’ shocking statement that it is &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; for us that he left and sent the Spirit than that he should have remained with us (John 16:7ff.). The life of the Christian must be a Spirit-filled and Spirit-empowered life. We can never overemphasize the work of the Spirit in our lives (though we may sometimes articulate that work inaccurately).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the Southern Baptist churches I have attended I have gained a deeper appreciation for the importance of evangelism and missions. Whether from the Great Commission in Matthew 28:18–20 or the similar notes sounded in Luke 24:45–49 and then throughout the book of Acts, it is clear that God’s people are called to evangelize wherever we go. (Closely related to the above point, however, this is not mere salesmanship. As Luke points out in Acts 1:8, the power for the church’s missionary work is the Holy Spirit, not human wisdom.) If the church forgets that her first and foremost calling is the proclamation of the gospel to all the nations, she will rapidly fall off the cart in one direction or another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The historic Baptist emphasis on regenerate church membership and the congregation’s responsibility for discipline are also essential ingredients to healthy, flourishing churches (and therefore for flourishing individual Christians). The countless “one another” passages of the New Testament (e.g. John 13:34–35, Ephesians 4:25–32) emphasize mutual service as an essential mark of Christian fellowship. Moreover, the well-known church discipline passages (Matthew 18:15–20) indicate clearly that the members of a congregation are to look out for each other’s spiritual well-being. Although this care has sometimes been twisted to abuse in other churches, we are blessed to participate in a context where the passages’ emphasis on forgiveness and restoration is kept front and center. Meaningful membership and congregational care through church discipline are not universally popular, but they are among the hallmarks of our particular corner of the Southern Baptist convention. This kind of care for the saints is not only necessary: it is &lt;em&gt;beautiful&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From my Presbyterian friends I have increasingly come to appreciate a more thoroughly confessional identity and the value of churches connected not only by sharing funds but also by polity. Acts 15 highlights that the early church resolved its most significant outstanding tension not by letting each church go its own way doctrinally, but by issuing a decision that was binding on &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the churches. Granted: the presence of the apostles then means our situation is not identical. Still, the event demands attention. Even a church with the illustrious history and (apostolic!) leadership of the congregation at Antioch did not feel equipped to make serious doctrinal decisions without consulting the rest of the church. This is not to deny that there are clear marks of local congregational responsibility throughout the epistles, only that the New Testament pattern was of churches in active contact, cooperation, and doctrinal dependence with each other in a way that appears &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; similar to a proto-presbytery, and quite unlike the radical autonomy of Baptist churches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also find the historic Reformed articulation of the relationship between the various spheres of life extremely compelling. Calvin and his heirs often advocated clearly and coherently for the goodness of the created order and for human activity therein. Here, vocation (including the arts) is taken not merely as a means to gospel proclamation, but as genuinely good in itself. This theme runs throughout Scripture: God commanded man to work before the Fall (cf. Genesis 2:5,15), and though work has been corrupted and made toilsome by the Fall, it remains good. The world itself was created good (Genesis 1), and though it groans with us for redemption (Romans 8:19–23) it still proclaims the glory of God (see Psalm 19 for just one of many examples). Many evangelicals pay lip service to the goodness of creation and vocation, but few outside the high church traditions (especially Anglican, Lutheran, and Presbyterian) carry the doctrine through in their practice. This leaves me hungry for the kind of intellectual, vocational, and artistic engagement I see in those traditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From late modern evangelicalism more broadly I have imbibed both my essential Christian temperament—my unsettled, “post-denominational” eccesiastical identity included!—and two other essential ingredients: a sense of catholicity, and a desire to do more and better in caring for “the least of these.” Set against Jesus’ “new command” in John 13, the divisions within the church are painful realities we should strive to see undone wherever possible. Our disagreements are not trivial; we cannot simply toss them aside. We can, however, glory in our common experience of “mere Christianity” and take opportunities where possible to worship our risen Lord together. We can also work together across denominational boundaries to care for the orphans and widows (James 1:27), to confront injustice in this age. The needs of the world around us are severe and painful; the various wings of the church can and should unite to bring what tastes we can of the justice and mercy of Christ’s kingdom into the present age—in the church, and everywhere else (Micah 6:8).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, and perhaps most importantly, I have found in &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of these movements a consistent emphasis on the centrality, authority, and sufficiency of Scripture. From my charismatic, Arminian-leaning youth minister to the pastors of the middle-America Bible church I attended during and after college to the elders of Calvinistic Baptist church we now call home, all have pointed consistently to God’s word as his ultimate self-revelation. These churches have &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; lived out a commitment to the idea that God’s word is living and active (Hebrews 4:12) and profitable in every way (2 Timothy 3:16–17).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the number of shifts in my past, the transition to another tradition would be relatively straightforward; apart from the issue of believer’s baptism, Presbyterianism looks quite appealing even now. Even beyond these more important convictional differences, I do not fit comfortably within the Baptistic tradition culturally. Its populism often verges on (and sometimes crosses into) anti-intellectualism. Its broadly helpful focus on evangelism and missions too often translates into a reductive approach that reduces all spheres of life to vehicles for gospel-proclamation—not recognizing that while in God’s providence they often serve as such, the myriad spheres of life are good in their own right. The Southern Baptist identification with the culture of the South is also problematic for someone culturally not a Southerner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discussions on the nature of the church and the history of the Baptist movement in this class have largely solidified my pre-existing discomfort within the Baptist tradition and somewhat intensified the struggle to define my ecclesiastical identity. The theological commitments and cultural habits of (especially Southern) Baptists trouble me deeply. Reading &lt;em&gt;The Baptist Way&lt;/em&gt; had precisely the opposite effect Norman intended: his polemical rhetoric bore the marks of profound ignorance of other traditions. Much of the reading on believers’ baptism was similarly dismissive—arguing not against the substance of other positions, but instead against caricatures thereof. Dockery’s call for renewal and consensus was more helpful, but it, too, had a sectarian bent. The denomination’s (and the broader tradition’s) deep anti-intellectualism and lasting suspicion of creeds and confessions make it unlikely that Southern Baptists will be able to claim the confessional identity or theological consensus they need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is an unfortunate reality that my experience of Baptists has too often been marked by denominational sectarianism, anti-intellectualism and anti-creedalism, and reductionistic and utilitarian approaches to God’s world. To be sure, there are exceptions to these trends, and I am grateful for them. But it means that, credobaptist though I am, “Baptist” and especially “Southern Baptist” are not and cannot be my ecclesiastical &lt;em&gt;identity&lt;/em&gt; unless they comes to mean something very different than they have for many years. In the meantime, I will remain a “Pres-matic Bap-terian”, and deeply grateful for the traditions that have shaped me and especially our current church—even when they are not a “perfect fit”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter that Deuteronomy had envisioned it and the prophets had foretold it; nothing could prepare one for the ruel reality and the apparently finality of the situation. The burden of Lamentations is not to question why this happened, but to give expression to the fact that it did. At certain moments the book seems to look beyond the destruction, to hold out hope for the future, but in the end despair overcomes hope. Past and future have little place in the book. It centers on the “present”—the moment of trauma, the interminable suffering. The book is not an explanation of suffering but a re-creation of it and a commemoration of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why immortalize this moment of destruction? Because in its own way it signals the truth of the Bible’s theology, and it points to the continuation of the covenant between God and Israel….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This explains why the poet can cry out to God and expect a response, why can vent his anger at God, why he can declare that God continues to exist even though his temple does not (Lam 5:18–19), why God is portrayed as so strong and the enemy gets no credit for the destruction. The suffering is, as it were, an affirmation that God is still there and still concerned with the fate of Israel. He may hide his face, but he has not ceased to be Israel’s God. Lamentations contains the seeds of comfort and religious rebuilding that the exilic prophets (especially Second Isaiah) developed more fully in the aftermath of the destruction.&lt;/p&gt;

The good folks at &lt;a href="//prts.edu"&gt;Puritan Reformed Theological Seminary&lt;/a&gt; who own the site wanted to replace its previous content with a Bible reading tool. While there’s still a lot to wrap up, the project is &lt;em&gt;nearing&lt;/em&gt; its conclusion, and I thought I’d note a few things I’ve learned (in some cases, learned &lt;em&gt;again&lt;/em&gt;) along the way. I want to say up front, lest these be taken the wrong way: I’m extremely proud of the work I’ve done, and the application I’ve delivered &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; work to the specifications I was hired to meet. More than that, it does it well. But, of course, it could do it &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt;. The following thoughts are therefore not, “How I failed” but rather “How I will do this &lt;em&gt;even better&lt;/em&gt; next time around.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Single page apps are great, but not always the right choice.&lt;/em&gt; I made the decision, based on my expectations and understandings of what I would need, to develop the site as a single-page web application. This was a mistake. Not the worst mistake ever: it has its upsides, including performance &lt;em&gt;once the app spins up&lt;/em&gt;, but for the kind of content I have here, I would take a different tack today. Better in this case to deliver static content and &lt;em&gt;update&lt;/em&gt; it dynamically as appropriate than to try to load all the content dynamically every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a technical level, that would probably mean supplementing standard HTML with &lt;a href="//backbonejs.org"&gt;Backbone&lt;/a&gt; instead of developing it as a single-page app in &lt;a href="//angularjs.org"&gt;Angular&lt;/a&gt;. For the backend, while I did it in Node.js and that would work fine, I’d probably do a straight Django app (especially with a few of the goals I learned about &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the project was well along in development).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Progressive enhancement or graceful degradation are hard in web applications, but they still matter.&lt;/em&gt; In the past, I’ve always taken a hard line on making sure things either degrade gracefully or are simply enhanced by JavaScript content. In the architecture decisions I made for this app, I failed to take that into account (largely because I thought it would just &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to work as a web app, but see above). I regret that enormously at this point; it would be much better in this particular case to have content available even if the additional functionality doesn’t work. Even if you &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; doing something where you are building an &lt;em&gt;app&lt;/em&gt;, finding ways to make it work on poor connections, older browsers, etc. matters. I’m still thinking a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; about the best way to do this in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;More popular doesn’t mean better.&lt;/em&gt; Angular has a ton of traction and uptake, and that was deceptive early on. I won’t so easily be fooled in the future. Angular is so very popular in part because Google can put serious money behind its development—and its marketing. But it’s &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the best for many applications; if you’re not in the business of developing your own custom framework, it’s not even &lt;em&gt;close&lt;/em&gt; to the best. Use Ember or Knockout or any number of other full-stack frameworks rather than a meta-framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to avoid making that mistake? Well, for my part since then, I’ve learned to look not just as the &lt;em&gt;quantity&lt;/em&gt; of material in a given community, but its &lt;em&gt;quality&lt;/em&gt;. For example, &lt;a href="//emberjs.com"&gt;Ember&lt;/a&gt; has &lt;em&gt;incredible&lt;/em&gt; documentation (far better than Angular’s), and they also have a much clearer vision and a more dependable approach to development (strict semantic versioning, etc.). Had I taken the time to read &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; sets of docs more carefully and think through the consequences of their designs more thoroughly, I could have recognized this before starting. Next time, I will do just that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will also look at the way the community behaves. The Ember community is &lt;em&gt;far&lt;/em&gt; friendlier for newcomers from what I’ve seen than the Angular community—no slam meant on the Angular crowd, but the Ember folks are just doing that really well. That matters, too. (I can’t speak for other communities, of course; these are just the groups I’ve watched the most.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, Ember would have been the better fit between these two (even though, as noted above, it also wouldn’t have been the &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; fit).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unit tests really are the best.&lt;/em&gt; I did a vast majority of this project with unit tests—the first time I’ve ever been able to do that for a whole project. In other projects, I’ve been able to do it for parts, but never this much. It saved my bacon a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt;. Where I got in a hurry and felt like I didn’t have time to write the tests, I (inevitably and predictably!) ended up spending a lot of time chasing down hard-to-isolate bugs—time I could have avoided by writing well-tested (and therefore better-factored) code in the first place. Lesson learned &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; thoroughly. Server- and client-side unit tests are &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; good. They’re also sometimes &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt;; getting mocks set up correctly for dealing with databases, etc. can take a while. That difficulty pays for itself, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unit tests &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; don’t replace API documentation.&lt;/em&gt; I have seen people advocate test-driven-development as a way of obviating the need to do major documentation of an API. This is, in a word, ridiculous. Having to read unit tests if you want to remember how you structured an API call is a pain in the neck. Don’t believe it. Design your API and document it, &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; do test-driven development against that contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sometimes ‘good enough’ is enough.&lt;/em&gt; There is always more to be done, and inevitably you can see a thousand things that could be improved. But ‘good’ shipping code is far more valuable than ‘perfect’ code that never ships. You should never ship &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; code, but sometimes you do have to recognize ‘good enough’ and push it out the door.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Full-stack development is fun, but it’s also really hard.&lt;/em&gt; I wrote every scrap of code in HolyBible.com proper (though of course it relies on a lot of third-party code). It was very, very difficult to manage that all by myself; it’s a lot to hold in one’s head. (One of the reasons I chose Node was because keeping my implementation and testing all in one language helped reduce that load somewhat.) Would I do it again? Sure. But very much chastened about the difficulties involved. It has been enormously rewarding, and I &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; being a full-stack developer. But it’s a lot of work, and now I know more clearly just how much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could say a great deal more about the technical side of things especially, but my biggest takeaway here is that a lot of the hardest and most important work in developing software has nothing to do with the code itself. Architecture and approach shape &lt;em&gt;far&lt;/em&gt; more than the implementation details (even if those details still matter an awful lot). And popularity is not at all the same as either &lt;em&gt;quality&lt;/em&gt; or (especially) &lt;em&gt;suitability for a given task&lt;/em&gt;. In the future, I will be better equipped for the necessary kinds of evaluation, and will hopefully make still better decisions accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I don’t want a back door,” Rogers said. “I want a front door. And I want the front door to have multiple locks. Big locks….”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rogers suggests the adoption of “front door” access will allow for essential security measures while keeping data safe from hackers or an outside attack. But opponents of the idea note that even broken into pieces, a master digital key creates security flaws. “There’s no way to do this where you don’t have unintentional vulnerabilities,” Donna Dodson, chief cyber­security adviser at the Commerce Department’s National Institute of Standards and Technologies, told the Post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That last bit is absolutely true. The government basically wants to make sure it can spy on anyone, any time it wants. That’s a bad, bad plan.&lt;/p&gt;

I &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/a-few-theses-on-blogging.html"&gt;resolved&lt;/a&gt; a while ago that if I was tempted to do that, I should just write a blog post instead. I failed at that resolution, but at a friend’s &lt;a href="https://alpha.app.net/jws/post/57108281"&gt;suggestion&lt;/a&gt;, am adapting it into a blog post anyway. You can see the posts that prompted it &lt;a href="https://alpha.app.net/keita/post/57096585"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://alpha.app.net/jws/post/57096838"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state of JavaScript frameworks today is a scale, really, from not-at-all-monolithic to totally-monolithic, in roughly this order: Backbone – React &amp;amp; Angular – Ember – Meteor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Backbone and related library Underscore are really collections of common JS tools and patterns you can use to write apps, but they’re not &lt;em&gt;frameworks&lt;/em&gt;, per se. You’ll write all your own boilerplate there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;React and Angular supply much &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; of the functionality, but Angular is a “meta-framework” that aims to do &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; boilerplate but let you construct your own custom app framework.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Angular is very powerful, but it’s kind of like Git: wires are exposed; you have to understand a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; about the internals to get it to do what you want. Its routing functionality is pretty limited out of the box, too—so much so that there’s a near-standard third-party router.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;React, as I understand it, supplies a paradigm and associated tools oriented primarily at view state management, though with capabilities via extensions for routing, etc. These tools are &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; powerful for performance in particular. It’s not a full framework, and the docs expressly note that you can &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; use React for the view layer with other tools if you want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In any case, Angular and React do &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; things from each other, but both do substantially more than Backbone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ember is a full framework, strongly emphasizing shared conventions (with a lot of common developers from Rails). It’s perhaps less adaptable than React or Angular, but is much more full-featured; you have very little boilerplate to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meteor is like Ember, but does server-side Node as well as client-side stuff, with the goal being to minimize code duplication, sharing assets as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of all of those, Ember has easily (easily!) the best-explained roadmap, most articulate leadership, and best development path. They are also aggressively adopting the best features of other frameworks wherever it makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Angular is currently in flux, as Google has announced Angular 2.0 will be basically a completely different framework; there will be &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; direct migration path for Angular 1.x apps to Angular 2.0+. Total rewrite required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ember uses a steady 6-week release schedule with very careful regression testing and semantic versioning, with clear deprecation notices and upgrade paths, and is therefore both rapidly iterating &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; relatively stable for use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you just need a set of tools for enhance functionality on otherwise relatively static pages, Backbone+Underscore is a great combo. If you already have a bunch of things in place but want a dedicated view layer, React is good.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re writing a new, full-on web &lt;em&gt;application&lt;/em&gt; (SPA, or organized in whatever other way), I think Ember is the very clear winner at this point. I have good confidence in their leadership and they’re firing on all cylinders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding Angular, &lt;a href="https://alpha.app.net/mikehoss"&gt;@mikehoss&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://alpha.app.net/mikehoss/post/57105656"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the record they are doing that to make it more mobile-friendly. The Ang1 has abysmal performance on mobile. Besides a time machine, this maybe the best option. And Miško is a bit of a jerk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t speak to his comment about Miško (Miško Hevery, one of the leads on AngularJS), but I agree about Angular itself: the rewrite needs to happen. Angular 1.x is a mess—as are its docs. It’s just not a good time to be using 1.x for any new projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll add to these points that I’ve used Angular for the last 9 months on HolyBible.com development. As I noted: the documentation is pretty rough, and in a lot of cases you really do have to understand what the framework is doing and how before you can get it to do the things you want. This is, in one sense, exactly the &lt;em&gt;opposite&lt;/em&gt; of what I’m looking for in a framework—but it makes sense given Angular’s goal of being a meta-framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather like Git, though, which was originally going to be infrastructure for version control systems which would have their own interface, but eventually just had a “good enough” interface that we’re all now stuck with, Angular is being used &lt;em&gt;as&lt;/em&gt; a framework, not just as a &lt;em&gt;meta-framework&lt;/em&gt;, and it’s unsurprisingly not great for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i class="editorial"&gt;Take this for what it’s worth: not the final word (by a long stretch) on JavaScript frameworks, but rather the perspective of one guy who notably &lt;em&gt;hasn’t used all of the frameworks&lt;/em&gt;, but has spent some time looking at them. Moreover, I haven’t particularly edited this; it’s more a summary in the kind of short-form posts that I originally created than a detailed analysis. The only things I’ve done are expand some of the notes on Angular and React, and add the footnote on React.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="refs" class="references"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;section class="footnotes"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; don’t know a ton about React, but I do think a lot of what I do know about it is cool from a programming perspective. From a designer perspective, however, it’s a bit of a pain: React’s “JSX” domain-specific language is &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; less friendly to developers than standard HTML, and therefore than either Ember or Angular, both of which implement their templating via HTML templating languages. There’s a substantil tradeoff there: React’s model is interesting not only academically but in practice because of the performance results it produces. It’s worth note, though, that others have recognized this and are adopting it to varying degrees; notably, Ember is incorporating the idea of minimizing changes to the DOM by keeping track of state and updating only differences, rather than refreshing the whole tree, in the new rendering engine (HTMLBars) they’re rolling out over the past several and future several releases.&lt;a href="#fnref1"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Baptismal Theology and Practice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are only two practices embraced universally throughout the Christian church: baptism and the Lord’s Supper. Even with these, serious differences remain, reflecting deeper distinctions in the theology and practice of the church. In the case of baptism, the questions of its meaning and mode tend to reflect the believer’s views on the nature of God’s saving work, the covenant community, and the church. Who should be baptized, and how, where, and under what circumstances are difficult, important questions. Believers must consider them carefully and hold their conclusions humbly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="baptismal-theology" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Baptismal Theology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baptism should be applied to believers, and is best carried out by immersion. However, while Baptist churches have often tended toward a dogmatic position on these, leading to a frequent practice of rebaptism, more caution is necessary—especially on the second point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="meaning" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Meaning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baptism is the covenant sign of one’s entrance into the Christian faith, and also a means of grace in the life of the Christian—not &lt;em&gt;saving&lt;/em&gt; grace, but real grace nonetheless, in the same way that fellowship with the saints, the preaching of the word, and the Lord’s supper are.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; God works grace in the life of believers in their obedience to his commands, of which baptism is among the clearest in the New Testament (Matt. 28:18–20, Acts 2:38). Moreover, it is the symbol and in some mysterious way also a means of the believer’s union with Christ in his death and resurrection (Rom. 6:3–4, Col. 2:8–14), an element of his union with Christ’s church (Eph. 4:4–6), and his appeal to God for a pure conscience (1 Pet. 3:21–22).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baptism is not merely a symbolic ordinance&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; but, as these passages make clear, a place in which God works uniquely in the life of the believer. Neither is paptism a work necessary for salvation, as is clear from the salvation of the thief on the cross (Luke 23:42–43, as well as from many other places that teach that faith alone is necessary for salvation). Nor is there warrant in Scripture for the idea that baptism is a means of regeneration or cleansing from original sin. Nonetheless, paptism is ordinarily a part of God’s saving work in his people’s lives. The reality that some are saved who are never baptized does not mean it plays no part in the believer’s life, but rather that its part is in &lt;em&gt;sanctification&lt;/em&gt; rather than in &lt;em&gt;justification&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="mode" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Mode&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly all Baptists historically have argued on the basis of the New Testament language that baptism &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be by immersion. The word βαπτίζω, usually transliterated to English as “baptize” rather than translated, is a secondary verb derived from the root βάπτω, broadly meaning simply “to dip or immerse.” While a full exegetical treatment is beyond the scope of this essay, two points must be remembered in any discussion of baptism. First, the normal meaning of both these words &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; dipping or immersion, and there are a number of examples which strongly suggest going down into and coming up out of standing water (Matt. 3:6–17, Mark 1:4–11, John 3:22, Acts 8:36–39). Second, however, the lexical domain of these verbs and of the various words derived from them within the New Testament alone is broader than dipping or immersion, and certainly includes the notion of washing.&lt;a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, its figurative uses throughout the New Testament range far more broadly than “immersion” alone: it includes partaking of trials (Mark 10:38, Luke 12:50); the transfoming work of the Spirit (Matt. 3:11, Acts 1:5, Acts 11:16), and even the Israelites’ passing through water without getting wet (1 Cor. 10:2). The most significant of these metaphorical texts is Paul’s argument that in baptism believers have been united with Christ in his death and resurrection (Rom. 6:3–4, Col. 2:8–14). The parallel imagery between the two is clear and potent: baptism visualizes death and resurrection. However, Paul’s parallel uses of the word “baptism” and “baptize” (e.g. 1 Cor. 12:13, Gal. 3:27) with “in Christ” demonstrate that the point of these passages is union with Christ—not mode of baptism. Immersion illustrates this reality most effectively, but immersion is not commanded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be granted, then, that the primary meaning of the word group is of dipping or immersion, but that it also includes a broader sense of washing or transformation. Likewise, given what documents there are from the first and second century, it seems safe to say that baptism was normally by immersion in the early church. However, it is too much to say that immersion is &lt;em&gt;demanded&lt;/em&gt; by the language used or by the examples in the New Testament. Rather, it should be preferred as the &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; way of expressing visually the death, burial and resurrection of the believer with Christ as well as the cleansing and transformative elements of the practice. At the same time, those who practice baptism by immersion should not reject baptisms by sprinkling or pouring as false or unbiblical baptisms.&lt;a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="subject" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Subject&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The debate over the &lt;em&gt;subject&lt;/em&gt; of baptism is similarly heated. There are essentially two positions on who should be baptized (with some variations in each position): that only new believers should be baptized, or that new believers and the children of believers should be baptized. While there are some important differences regarding the &lt;em&gt;meaning&lt;/em&gt; of the baptism of believers, it is the universal practice of all Christian churches. The baptism of infants or as-yet-unbelieving children of newly converted parents, however, has been attributed a wide number of meanings, ranging from cleansing from original sin and the beginning of the individual’s own work of salvation (the Catholic view) to entrance into the covenant community conditioned on personal faith (the Presbyterian view).&lt;a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, the vast majority of Christians throughout all history prior to the 20th century baptized infants. On the other hand, the believer is responsible finally to submit to the Bible, tradition notwithstanding; if the Scriptures teaches credobaptism, even the weight of so much tradition must be set aside. Nonetheless, church history is often illuminating for difficult interpretive issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earliest unambiguous mention of infant baptism is Tertullian’s condemnation of the practice in 198 A.D. Less than two decades later, though, Hippolytus advocated the baptism of children incapable of answering for themselves less than two decades later (parents or other relatives were to speak on behalf of their children).&lt;a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Some argue that the commands for those baptized in earlier documents such as the &lt;em&gt;Didache&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; precludes children’s having been baptized, but this is an argument from silence—and these same kinds of commands appear in the “Apostolic Tradition” following the instruction regarding children. In any case, practice in the church was mixed by the end of the second century at the latest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evidence from New Testament practice is also ambiguous.&lt;a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; It is true that in the cases where the recipients of baptism are clearly delineated, they are believers. However, any argument regarding the household baptisms is necessarily an argument from silence. There is no grounds in the text for asserting that &lt;em&gt;none&lt;/em&gt; of the households that received baptism included infants or small children incapable of professing faith.&lt;a href="#fn9" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref9"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; To say otherwise is to read one’s theological presuppositions into the text. By the same token, however, paedobaptists have no more warrant than do credobaptists for claiming these passages as clear evidence for their view. Believers may of course argue that these passages should be interpreted in light of their understanding of the rest of the New Testament—but without the dogmatism too often present on both sides. The passages simply do not say; indeed, no passage in the New Testament even speaks clearly about believing children.&lt;a href="#fn10" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref10"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the subject of baptism can be determined only through the passages that teach about its meaning and function in the life of the believer. Covenantal paedobaptists&lt;a href="#fn11" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref11"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; argue that, in continuity with the pattern of the Abrahamic Covenant, children of believers—that is, children of those who are themselves members of the covenant community of faith—should be baptized. They note, rightly, that the major points of discontinuity marked off by the New Covenant are with the &lt;em&gt;Mosaic&lt;/em&gt; covenant rather than the Abrahamic Covenant. As such, they suggest that just as the (male) children of members of the Abrahamic covenant were circumcised to symbolize their entrance into the covenant community, so likewise (all) children of members of the New Covenant should be baptized. The covenant view rightly distinguishes between the role of the symbol and the necessary faith of the believer. It also rightly identifies the church with Abraham’s offspring (cf. Luke 3:7–9) and takes seriously the teaching in both Testaments that Abraham and his offspring were saved by faith, not merely by being members of the people of Israel (see esp. Gal. 3:1–6).&lt;a href="#fn12" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref12"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, while the Abrahamic covenant led directly to the New Covenant, it nonetheless had an ethnic or national bent to it that the New Covenant does not. The Abrahamic covenant was with Abraham and his offspring in a specific nation, though for the good of all nations (Gen. 12:1–7, 15:1–21, 17:1–14). Circumcision was established for Abraham and his descendants as their act of covenant (Gen 17:9–14). Yet the New Testament unambiguously does away with circumcision as the mark of participation in God’s community (cf. Acts 10:1–48, 16:3, 1 Cor. 7:18, Gal. 2:3, 5:2). The New Covenant circumcision is one “made without hands” (Col. 2:11; cf. Deut. 30:6, Rom. 2:29) and is tied directly to baptism—“the circumcision of Christ” (Col. 2:11b–12).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The covenant paedobaptist is right that baptism is to the church what circumcision was to the Jews, but wrong about how entrance into the covenant community now comes about.&lt;a href="#fn13" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref13"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Again: salvation was always by faith, but the people of God are no longer constituted ethnically or nationally, but by faith alone. To become one of God’s people in the Abrahamic covenant was to join the nation of Israel; even when, as in Ruth’s case, that commitment was one of faith it was also national and ethnic. It is no longer. Those who are to be baptized are those who have become disciples (Matt. 28:18–20), repented (Acts 2:38–39), been united with Christ in his death and resurrection (Rom. 6:3, Col 2:12), put on Christ (Gal. 3:27), asked God for cleansing from sin (Acts 22:17) and for a clear conscience (1 Pet. 3:21). In the New Covenant, &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; those who profess faith are marked as belonging to the people of God.&lt;a href="#fn14" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref14"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In line with the practice described in the New Testament, then, only believers should be baptized today: those who have made a clear and credible profession of faith. However, those who affirm believer’s baptism should be careful not to overstate their case. While the New Testament does incline this way, there is no slam-dunk case, and no therefore warrant for sneering at those who disagree. Moreover, other convictions held in light of one’s position on baptism must be held moderately, in light of the provisional character of the doctrine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="excursus-rebaptism" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Excursus: Rebaptism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rebaptism is a serious matter. It argues that the first baptism a person underwent was not in fact a Christian baptism at all, for one should not otherwise be rebaptized. There is only one instance of rebaptism recorded in the New Testament: that of the believers in Ephesus (Acts 19), who had not been baptized in the name of Jesus at all. If the meaning, mode, and subject of baptism as outlined above are correct, then it is appropriate to rebaptize those who have been baptized as unbelievers (including as children) or by those who are not orthodox Christians (e.g. Mormons). However, it is inappropriate to rebaptize those who were baptized by a mode other than immersion,&lt;a href="#fn15" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref15"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for the mode of baptism is neither a primary issue nor a point asserted dogmatically anywhere in Scripture. Moreover, it is also inappropriate to rebaptize those who were baptized as believers, but by churches holding differing views on the meaning of baptism but which are nonetheless true Christian churches. Any baptism applied to a believer on a valid profession of faith by a true church ought to be respected by other Christian churches.&lt;a href="#fn16" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref16"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="baptismal-practice" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Baptismal Practice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;section id="baptism-and-the-lords-supper" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Baptism and the Lord’s Supper&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many Baptists have argued that the Lord’s Supper should be reserved for those who have been baptized as believers, by immersion—a position that dates from the origin of Baptist life (in the writings of William Kiffen) to the present day (see the Baptist Faith and Message 2000 for just one example). A minority of Baptists throughout the history of the movement (famously including John Bunyan) have argued to the contrary: that the table ought to be open to any who have given a valid profession of faith, or are members in good standing of other Christian churches. Finally, a yet-smaller group has practiced local-church-only communion, in which only the members of a given congregation may partake of communion there. The first position, though most common, is perhaps least sustainable in the author’s view. The fully open and local-church-only views are more self-consistent in their interpretation of the relevant passages on the Lord’s Supper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All those answering this question are attempting to deal rightly with the reality that coming to the Table is a serious matter. The New Testament teaches that Christians are not to partake of the meal with those who are in unrepentant sin (1 Cor. 5) and warns that judgment will come on those who themselves partake of the meal while unrepentant (1 Cor. 11:20–30). Moreover, unrepentant sin is the only boundary set around the table in the New Testament. But arguing that being mistaken about even a practice so central as baptism constitutes unrepentant sin is problematic. There are other doctrines of denomination-forming importance, and which believers regard as sin issues; if this logic were to be applied consistently, Christians could never share the Table with anyone who did not share their every denominational distinctive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Mike Bergman comments, the Lord’s Table is for disciples—for all those who will be eating the supper together when the Lord returns.&lt;a href="#fn17" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref17"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The “closed” communion position wrongly restricts the practice on the basis of a doctrinal distinctive—one having little to do with the meaning of the Table itself. Baptism is important, but to be incorrect on a secondary (albeit important) issue is not remotely as unrepentant sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advocates of closed communion sometimes argue for a modified version of this position. Instead, they argue that participation in the Lord’s Supper requires that one already have been baptized, and that since paedobaptism or baptism by a mode other than immersion are by (their) definition not baptisms at all, such believers should not be admitted to the table.&lt;a href="#fn18" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref18"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; However, this is also problematic. First of all, it assumes facts not in evidence. The New Testament makes no comment on the issue whatsoever, presumably because it was not an issue (regardless of the question of credo- or paedobaptism), leaving one with no direct exegetical warrant for drawing the line here. Moreover, the result is to exclude from the table other believers whose faith in Christ one fully acknowledges and who one is confident will share in the feast at the end of ages—on the basis of a debated interpretive issue, where the New Testament draws no such line. Again, this reduces in no uncertain terms to the idea that doctrinal differences are sufficient for excluding people from the Table, and sets one rapidly on the path to sectarianism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, advocates of the local-church-only position rightly note that the local church, and especially her shepherds, have a responsibility for the souls of those who partake of the Table. Again, the New Testament is clear that partaking of the talbe in known, unrepentant sin is a cause for judgment; it is likewise clear that churches are as part of the practice of church discipline remove unrepentant members from the table. Since the local church cannot ordinarily know the spiritual condition of a visitor, it is safer to restrict communion only to those about whom the congregation does have knowledge: members. However, this position is similarly hard to sustain from the New Testament. While churches are to remove from membership and access to the table those who are in unrepentant sin, there is no indication of restricting the Table only to those in the local congregation. Moreover, the text most often cited as evidence for this position (1 Cor. 11:28) actually speaks to individuals holding themselves accountable, rather than to churches holding their members accountable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that the New Testament pattern is indeed of baptism, the question once again is whether the issue of baptism is so certain as to warrant this kind of restriction. If, as argued above, there are grounds for holding a credobaptist position only with considerable humility, Christians must likewise take care not to draw too thick a line around other elements of the church’s practice on the basis of baptismal doctrine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="baptism-and-the-local-church" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Baptism and the Local Church&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the same arguments applied to the Lord’s Supper have been applied to the issue of church membership, and many of the same concerns are in play. However, many Baptist churches today practice open communion but closed membership, and a number of high-profile Baptist leaders throughout history have advocated for open membership as well as open communion.&lt;a href="#fn19" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref19"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Baptists have universally argued for a regenerate church membership, and believer’s baptism by immersion has &lt;em&gt;usually&lt;/em&gt; been understood to be a prerequisite for membership, since other forms of baptism have been deemed invalid.&lt;a href="#fn20" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref20"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Moreover, since a local church is not merely a group of believers who happen to come together, but a group united around common affirmations about the nature of the Christian life and the truths Scripture teaches, local churches rightly have a higher bar for membership than merely that a person appears truly to be saved.&lt;a href="#fn21" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref21"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Churches should certainly not admit to membership those who affirm their stance on baptism yet continue to refuse it. In cases where the person affirms paedobaptism, though, membership may not be wholly out of bounds—for the same reason that the Lord’s supper is not: the unity of the body of Christ matters enormously. It will &lt;em&gt;usually&lt;/em&gt; be best in such circumstances to direct the individual to another evangelical church in the area that practices paedobaptism.&lt;a href="#fn22" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref22"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; This best reflects the importance and seriousness of baptism. However, there may be times when the best option is to admit such an individual to membership—e.g., in cases where the baptistic church is the evangelical congregation in the area. Baptism is important, but not so important as to leave a regenerate individual or family without fellowship. Until Christ returns and finally sets all doctrines aright, people should gather with those with whom they share core doctrinal affiliations where possible—and be welcomed as brothers and sisters in Christ where it is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; possible. Such a practice may, by the grace of God, be used a little to knit together again the fractured body of the church catholic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="is-baptism-a-church-ordinance" class="level4"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Is baptism a church ordinance?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some believers argue that baptism is specifically a church ordinance, and as such that it should never (or only in very rare circumstances) be carried out outside the church. Since baptism is the believer’s initiation into the church, it is the right only of the church to carry it out.&lt;a href="#fn23" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref23"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; However, in nearly every case in the New Testament, the newly baptized believers constituted the first members of the church, and baptism is rarely mentioned outside of “church planting” narratives. In the few cases where baptisms in the local church &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; discussed (1 Cor. 15:29), the content is simply not relevant. Indeed, Jesus himself presided over (but did not participate in) a great many baptisms prior to the formation of the local church, and evidently to a different end than “Christian baptism”—certainly the symbolism of death, burial, and resurrection with Christ remained hidden from those recipients of baptism. As with John’s baptism, this seems to have been a baptism “for repentance from sins” (Mark 1:4). Given the relative silence of Scripture on the subject, it again seems best not to stake out too strong a position on who may and may not baptize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly the normal circumstance will be baptism in the context of a local church, because the local church is the home of Christian ministry. However, this is not a normative practice; should a person come to faith in the context of a parachurch ministry, there is no basis for arguing that it is &lt;em&gt;categorically&lt;/em&gt; wrong for the parachurch ministry to perform the convert’s baptism. To be sure, a parachurch ministry that consistently baptizes new converts may run the risk of usurping the church’s role—but in this case, the baptismal practice is a reflection of the problem, not itself the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="the-age-for-baptism" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Age for Baptism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the credo-baptist position that only those who have made a credible profession of faith should be baptized, the question arises: how old must someone be to offer a profession that the church deems credible and therefore administers baptism? Put negatively, is there an age below which such a baptism would be more akin to paedo- than to credobaptism? Or should any profession of faith be accepted, regardless of the child’s age? There are a number of good arguments in favor of baptizing even very young children after a clear profession of faith.&lt;a href="#fn24" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref24"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; First, there is no evidence in Scripture for delaying baptism after clear professions of faith: baptism normally followed a profession of faith immediately.&lt;a href="#fn25" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref25"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Second, delaying baptism as a sort of “litmus test” for baptism implies that something besides repentance and faith in Christ is necessary for salvation. Third, it is not giving false assurance to affirm even a child’s trust in Christ through the gospel—perhaps even to the contrary (Mark 10:13–16). Moreover, the New Testament pattern for confirmation of salvation is always a matter of encouraging those who &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; made a profession to hold fast to it (cf. Heb. 2, 4, 6, 10), rather than discouraging people from profession or baptism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there are also a number of reasons to consider delaying baptism for children.&lt;a href="#fn26" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref26"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; One caution against baptizing young adults who have made a profession is the historic practice of baptistic churches, and that of many baptistic churches outside the United States, where baptism has been and remains a matter for adulthood. Another is the reality that young children, being easily swayed by their parents or peers, might be inclined to make false professions of faith—even apparently sincere ones. Of course, &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; profession of faith may be made for the wrong reasons.&lt;a href="#fn27" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref27"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; It is not the church’s job to prevent false profession from being made, but to respond appropriately when a false profession has been made (Matt. 18, 1 Cor. 5). Moreover, as noted above, Scripture is simply silent on the age of non-adults baptized, so making a hard and fast rule is unwarranted. It may nonetheless be wise to baptize only individuals who are judged capable of making their own professions of faith—perhaps those in their early pre-teen years and onward, as judged together by parents and church leaders in each case.&lt;a href="#fn28" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref28"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="summary" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baptism is the sign of the New Covenant, and should be applied to the members of that covenant: believers. The preferred mode is immersion, but other modes may be allowed if circumstances demand. Similarly, the church is the ordinary context and her members the normal adminstrators of baptism, but it matters most that a person be baptized by an orthodox Christian in the Trinitarian formula. Those who have been baptized as believers ought not be rebaptized, regardless of mode. Those who have not been baptized as believers may partake of the Lord’s table, but should not ordinarly become members of a Baptist church. In all these things, the people of God ought to rejoice in their participation in the death and resurrection of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Lord’s Supper belongs in a distinct category, insofar as it is a means of &lt;em&gt;special&lt;/em&gt; grace in the Christian life, but it fits in this list as well.&lt;a href="#fnref1"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contra Thomas White, “What Makes Baptism Valid?” in &lt;em&gt;Restoring Integrity in Baptist Churches&lt;/em&gt;, eds. Thomas White, Jason G. Duesing, and Malcolm B. Yarnell, III (Grand Rapids: Kregel Publications, 2008), 110–111.&lt;a href="#fnref2"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn3"&gt;&lt;p&gt;See e.g. Luke 11:38, where it is clear the Pharisees were not surprised that Jesus failed to take a whole-body bath; or Mark 7:4, where the same word is used of washing after returning from the market; or Hebrews 6:2, 9:10, where it refers to ritual purification&lt;a href="#fnref3"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn4"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was the pattern of the early church, as evidenced by the very early “Didache”, which argued for baptism by immersion if possible and by pouring if necessary (&lt;em&gt;Didache&lt;/em&gt; 7).&lt;a href="#fnref4"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This may be taken as a secondary argument against paedobaptism—a point made to the author and others by Nathan Finn in a number of personal conversations and in several class lectures, 2013–2015.&lt;a href="#fnref5"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Apostolic Tradition of Hippolytus of Rome 21.4.&lt;a href="#fnref6"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn7"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Didache 7.&lt;a href="#fnref7"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contra many Baptists, e.g. R. Stanton Norman, &lt;em&gt;The Baptist Way: Distinctives of a Baptist Church&lt;/em&gt; (Nashville: Broadman &amp;amp; Holman Publishers, 2005), 110–112; White, 109–110.&lt;a href="#fnref8"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn9"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contra e.g. Norman, 110–111.&lt;a href="#fnref9"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn10"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nearest the New Testament comes to it are: Jesus’ welcome of little children (Mark 10:13–16), Paul’s admonitions to those married to unbelievers for the sake of their spouse and children (1 Cor. 7:12–16), and Paul’s instructions to presumably believing children and their parents (Eph. 6:1–4, Col. 3:20–21) .&lt;a href="#fnref10"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn11"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For constraints of time and space, the author has left aside other views, many of which are both historically and practically significant and deserves serious interaction, but which have in the author’s view less Scriptural warrant (to varying degrees) than the covenant position.&lt;a href="#fnref11"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn12"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also perhaps surprising that in all the controversy stirred up by the Judaizers in the early church, there is no mention of hostility over children being excluded from the New Covenant—a fairly striking change between the two. This is especially so given that the distinction between Old and New Covenants did not preclude the Judaizers from arguing for many &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; points of even stronger continuity between Mosaic practice and that of the church—still less Abrahamic practice and that of the church. However, this is another argument from silence and so cannot be taken as strong evidence one way or the other. (Personal conversation with Doug Serven, August 5, 2010.)&lt;a href="#fnref12"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn13"&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Piper, “What Is Baptism, and How Important Is It?” (sermon, Bethlehem Baptist Church, July 20, 2008).&lt;a href="#fnref13"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn14"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The contested passages in Acts are left aside because, as has been noted, they do not prove what either side claims they do. Lydia believed, and her household was baptized—does this mean her household had no infants in it and everyone in it converted with her? It is impossible to say.&lt;a href="#fnref14"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn15"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contra e.g. Nathan Finn, “A Baptist perspective on -re-baptism-”, BRNow.org, posted February 25, 2013, http://www.brnow.org/Opinions/Guest-Columns/February-2013/A-Baptist-perspective-on-re-baptism (accessed March 28, 2015).&lt;a href="#fnref15"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn16"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This, of course, partly begs the question, for it leaves aside the matter of what constitutes a “true Christian church”—certainly a contested issue, and one beyond the scope of this paper. At a minimum, no group which rejects orthodox Trinitarianism and Christology may be included. At most, some major denominations may be excluded. The author is inclined to treat believers’ baptisms even by groups with serious doctrinal problems such as Roman Catholics as valid, however, so long as the specific congregation by which the believer was baptized rightly proclaimed a gospel of repentance from sins and salvation through the finished work of Christ alone.&lt;a href="#fnref16"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

Dever rightly grants that there is no biblical instruction about &lt;em&gt;who&lt;/em&gt; should baptize (331) while failing to note that there is similarly no express statement that it is a church ordinance.&lt;a href="#fnref23"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

I left it aside because it certainly wasn’t Barrs’ fault, and would have seemed absurdly nitpicky to my audience there. But it bears comment nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The small caps! The divine name appeared in a number of places throughout the books, as &lt;span class="smcp"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; (just as it does in the Bible). Unfortunately, Crossway chose to use a Palatino variant without real &lt;a href="http://ilovetypography.com/2008/02/20/small-caps/"&gt;small capitals&lt;/a&gt;. Yes, I know: it’s a little detail, and in the grand scheme of things it isn’t &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; important. But it’s the little details like that which add up to the difference between a so-so printing of a book and a truly delightful printing of a book. They make a big difference in the experience of reading the book (albeit usually a subconscious one, unless like me you are a typography nerd). I think that a book on the arts, of all books, should have really delightful typesetting. (Honestly, &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; books should have good typesetting, but the lack is even less excusable when the book is about beauty!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I started reading Bruce Ashford’s new book, &lt;em&gt;Every Square Inch&lt;/em&gt;. Five pages in, I’m enjoying his writing so far, but two things are making it a less-than-delightful experience. One is the typeface—the same custom serif used in Logos. It is functional, but there are many irritating details about it. Above all, it screams that it was designed for screens and has not been adjusted for use in print. The other major issue is the page margins. The inner margins are perfectly respectable; the outer margins are so narrow that my much-less-typographically-obsessive wife &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; immediately noted and commented on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These things matter. The old patterns of book-printing—careful designs of everything from leading to line length to the size of margins—were patterns for a reason. In the new digital-everything era, too many of these lessons have been forgotten or ignored by startup presses, and it’s making everyone’s reading experience unnecessarily worse. Typography is a skill and an art that can make an &lt;em&gt;enormous&lt;/em&gt; difference in the experience of reading a book; it is one we need publishers like Lexham Press and Crossway to reappropriate.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rant over. But please, publishers: work to make your typography &lt;em&gt;excellent&lt;/em&gt;, not just passable. Pay attention to your margins and your small capitals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crossway I &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; can do it, because their ESV line includes some of the best Bible typesetting done by &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt;. They just need to apply that everywhere!&lt;a href="#fnref1"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

At first I was extremely skeptical of the only-one-port approach, but the more I’ve thought about it, the more sense it makes to me. Why? &lt;em&gt;Market segmentation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a MacBook, not a MacBook Pro. &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; need more ports than this. But &lt;a href="http://jaimiekrycho.com/"&gt;Jaimie&lt;/a&gt;? I don’t remember the last time I saw her plug anything into the machine besides its power cord. This is a MacBook for ordinary users, not a machine for power-users. Now, I still think that the loss of MagSafe is a bit sad; it has saved us more than once (especially with young children in the house). But in terms of the needs of ordinary users, a single port that &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; double as video out or USB input really is perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, it lets Apple cleanly differentiate between its MacBook and MacBook Pro lines. If you need the ports for expandability—because you’re a power user—you get a Pro. If you don’t, you get the MacBook. The tradeoffs with CPU make sense here, too: a computer that performs about like a 2012 MacBook Air would not be my favorite for development work. But for the writing work that Jaimie does? Again, the performance levels there are perfectly reasonable. It’ll do everything she needs, and do it &lt;em&gt;well&lt;/em&gt;. Throw in the retina screen, and it’ll be really nice for her purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, I fully expect that we’ll end up getting her a 2nd or 3rd generation machine when we need to replace her current (a 2010 white MacBook) sometime in 2016–17.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So: better done than I initially thought, Apple.&lt;/p&gt;

I have not &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; finished the plan, but I &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; read the whole text of the Bible in that time (just not in sequence!). The HCSB is a very solid and reliable translation, and I have no qualms recommending it, alongside the NLT, the NIV,&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the ESV, and the NASB as valuable and helpful modern translations. (Other translations may also be helpful, but those are the English translations with which I am most familiar.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than try to do a detailed analysis and review—a task that would take a great many words indeed—I thought I would simply offer some observations on the text gleaned from this read through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="the-translation" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Translation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Published by Holman Bible Publishers, the HCSB is a relatively recent translation, dating to 2004. (Holman is part of Lifeway, the for-profit publishing arm of the Southern Baptist Convention.) The HCSB was totally new translation, rather than a revision of an older tradition, based on the NA27/UBS4 Greek text and the BHS5 text. The translation committee called their translation strategy “optimal equivalence”, aiming for a balance between the more wooden “functional” and the more free (but also looser) “dynamic” equivalence philosophies. (On the name of their equivalence, more in a moment.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="general-philosophy" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;General Philosophy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The translators described their overall philosophy as “optimal equivalence”—shooting for a balance between “formal” and “dynamic” equivalence, perhaps most popularly represented by the NASB and NIV respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I find the translators’ goals admirable, and I think the results are generally fairly good, a word about their name for the philosophy is in order. To call one’s translation philosophy “optimal equivalence” is nearly tautological. &lt;em&gt;Every&lt;/em&gt; translator thinks that her approach is optimal given the goals she sets herself. Otherwise, she would pick a different strategy—one more &lt;em&gt;optimal&lt;/em&gt; for the goals of her translation!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the results, in truth I think the come a great deal closer to “dynamic equivalence” than the translators might care to acknowledge. The difference between “optimal” and “dynamic” equivalence here is fairly lean; in truth, it seems more a matter of the particular tastes of the translation committee than of actually being more “functionally” equivalent than the NIV. If we conceived of the dynamic-functional equivalence scale as ranging from 1 to 10, with 1 being a full paraphrase and 10 being a 1st-year student’s word-for-word gloss of the original, the NIV would be about a 4 and the HSCB about a 5. (I would rate the NLT about a 2.5–3, the ESV a 7, and the NASB 8–8.5.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no problem with that; the result is a fairly solid reading Bible. Like the NIV and the NLT, its biggest weakness is a certain flatness of style—there is little to distinguish Paul from Peter or the Chronicler from the author of Kings. The ESV manages to bring through some of those authorial quirks and idiosyncrasies a bit more, but sometimes at the cost of clear English.&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The biggest place this flattening shows up is in the poetic language: the Psalms here are not &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt;, but they’re never especially beautiful, either. That’s a real shame. The prosaic meaning of the Psalms does come through well enough, but at the cost of precisely that element that makes them so compelling and have given them such a lasting influence: their poetic voice.&lt;a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="leaving-behind-the-kjv" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Leaving Behind the KJV&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The HCSB, to a greater extent than many other conservative translations, demonstrates considerable willingness to diverge from the readings of the KJV. In many ways, this is good: it makes for better (modern) English, and in many cases a better translation as well, since our knowledge both of the textual basis of the Bible and of the original languages has advanced somewhat since 1611.&lt;a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Occasionally, though, and especially in the poetic sections, the result is a serious flattening of the text. Compare, for example, their translation of Job 38:11. The HCSB reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when I declared: “You may come this far, but no farther;&lt;br /&gt;
    your proud waves stop here”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The KJV has:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further:&lt;br /&gt;
    and here shall thy proud waves be stayed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, I am not &lt;em&gt;terribly&lt;/em&gt; sad to see the archaic pronouns go (though I do miss their precision a bit!). But “here shall thy proud waves be stayed” sings in a way that “your proud waves stop here” just… doesn’t. It’s not bad, but it isn’t particularly poetic, either. The ESV follows the KJV more closely, with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and said, ‘Thus far shall you come, and no farther,&lt;br /&gt;
    and here shall your proud waves be stayed’?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That manages to keep the poetry of the KJV while using modern English, perhaps the best tradeoff under the circumstances. Given the extent to which the language and rhythm of the KJV have shaped modern English, there are times abandoning the KJV actually &lt;em&gt;hurts&lt;/em&gt; the translation. This goes back to the point above: poetics matter. This is not a failing of the HCSB alone, though; every dynamic equivalence translation I’ve read falls into the same trap. (And again: the functionally equivalent translations fall into &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; traps; in any case no one ever accused the NASB of containing particularly &lt;em&gt;beautiful&lt;/em&gt; English—in poetry or prose!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="the-divine-name" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Divine Name&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The HCSB’s handling of the divine name (יהוה) is… strange. The translators chose to supply “Yahweh” in some places but &lt;span class="smcp"&gt;“Lord”&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class="smcp"&gt;“God”&lt;/span&gt; in others. They opted to use “Yahweh” anytime the author explicitly refers to the name (שׁמ) of God in the nearest sentences. However, they do not continue to transliterate the name in the &lt;em&gt;follwing&lt;/em&gt; context, even when that would be appropriate. As a result, it is not uncommon for a passage to include &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; “Yahweh” and &lt;span class="smcp"&gt;“Lord”&lt;/span&gt;, which muddles things considerably. They also supply “Yahweh” from time to time when “name” is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; in the immediate context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This particular approach is, in my view, unhelpful at best. Those who are offended by seeing the divine name in print or hearing it read aloud will be offended. Those who are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; offended and find it helpful to see and hear the divine name directly will only find it some of the time. Moreover, the inconsistency within a given passage can make it even &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; clear than in a translation that simply sticks to the small-capitals convention (&lt;span class="smcp"&gt;“Lord”/“God”&lt;/span&gt;). I am generally approve transliterating the name, but consistency is often the most important element for clarity and comprehension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="miscellaneous-translation-notes" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Miscellaneous Translation Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a number of other quirks in the translation I thought worth noting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of the more usual “…declares the &lt;span class="smcp"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;” or “…says the &lt;span class="smcp"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;,” the tranlators opted to go with “This is the &lt;span class="smcp"&gt;Lord’s&lt;/span&gt; declaration…” and “This is what the &lt;span class="smcp"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; says….” This is a perfectly defensible translation, but is another case where diverging from the traditional reading, even for more normal English, actually sounds a bit jarring. I never actually adjusted to it, even after weeks of seeing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve been spending an awful lot of time looking at the prophetic books in Hebrew lately, and I get to eat some crow on this one. Where the HCSB has “this is the &lt;span class="smcp"&gt;Lord’s&lt;/span&gt; declaration”, the original text usually has some that, brought over in an extremely wooden sense, would be “declaration of the &lt;span class="smcp"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;”, so this really is &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; than the original—even if it is a bit jarring!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The treatment of units is splendid overall. It is, however, inconsistent. Units of distance, weight, and so on are all translated directly into their modern English equivalents. (This being a very American translation, the units are all Imperial, of course.) Reading miles instead of &lt;em&gt;stadia&lt;/em&gt; and inches or feet instead of &lt;em&gt;cubits&lt;/em&gt; was quite helpful and illuminating. On the other hand, the translators treated money very differently, simply leaving them in the original units. Perhaps they were concerned about currency fluctuations or the vagaries of inflation on the value of money over time. Perhaps there is no better way to handle monetary units, but the inconsistency remained a trifle jarring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were a number of passages where the hermeneutical biases of the translators came through clearly. Their rendering of John 3:36, for example, supplies a great deal more than can be justified on the basis of the Greek text alone. The HCSB has:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one who believes in the Son has eternal life, but the one who refuses to believe in the Son will not see life; instead, the wrath of God remains on him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The translation the HCSB is certainly one possible interpretation of the text, but that interpretation must be justified on the basis of many other texts; the plain sense of the original is as the ESV has it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All translation involves some degree of interpretation, but on the whole the HCSB translators did an admirable job of leaving ambiguities in the original unresolved. That made instances like this one all the more jarring—though, given that the HCSB is more dynamic than not, perhaps unsurprising. (The NIV makes almost exactly the same move as the HCSB here.) Hopefully they will pull it back a bit in future revisions of the text.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="conclusion" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The various issues highlighted above notwithstanding, I have enjoyed reading through the HCSB over the last few months. It is a solid, respectable translation and the men and women who worked on it are to be commended for their work. Because of the quirks listed above, however, I do not expect it will become a go-to translation for me. At the end of the day, the HCSB’s “optimal equivalence” boils down to a slightly tighter dynamic equivalence. As thigns stand, though, I would rather use either the NIV or the NLT among the dynamic equivalence translations—both are more consistent translations than the HCSB, and therefore require less explanation when teaching and less mental hoop-jumping when reading. By the same token, the ESV is a very good translation more on the functional end of the spectrum, and certainly checks off those boxes much more effectively than does the HCSB. Again: it is not so much that the HCSB is a &lt;em&gt;poor&lt;/em&gt; translation as that it does not do anything sufficiently &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; than other existing translations as to displace them in my current reading and study habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="refs" class="references"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section class="footnotes"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, even the NIV2011. On the gendered/inclusive language controversy, I basically follow D. A. Carson in &lt;em&gt;The Inclusive-Language Debate: A Plea for Realism&lt;/em&gt;. The nature of language simply does not allow the kinds of lines that many conservatives (including myself in the past) have been inclined to draw. This becomes immediately apparent when considering translation into either languages without grammatical gender (even as in the case of English’s neuter article: “the” indicates neither masculinity nor femininity, just like the Hebrew הַ, but unlike Greek’s ὁ/ἡ/το trio) or languages with &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; grammatical genders. (Similarly, in his discussion of the “gender” of the Holy Spirit, Dan Wallace in his &lt;em&gt;Grammar&lt;/em&gt; argues strongly against taking the gendered pronoun in Jesus’ discussion of the Spirit as indicative of personal gender.) This is simply bad linguistics, and therefore also poor theology. There is much more that could be said here, but in any case I do not have the problems many of my fellow theological conservatives do with the NIV2011.&lt;a href="#fnref1"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is exactly what I mean about “optimal” equivalence: which of these results is &lt;em&gt;optimal&lt;/em&gt;? Neither, and both! It depends on what you’re going for!&lt;a href="#fnref2"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn3"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact of the matter is: the meaning of a poem is never so cleanly separable from its form. I’ve written about this—though too briefly—&lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/mouths-of-poets.html"&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a href="#fnref3"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn4"&gt;&lt;p&gt;No Byzantine priority for me! Also, I mean no offense to the KJV translators, who did a truly phenomenal job. I happen to think, though, that &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; would be pleased to see the work of translation continue forward, rather than remaining fixed on their particular work.&lt;a href="#fnref4"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

In the meantime… consider this a rough draft of a larger idea I’m working out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw a &lt;a href="https://jasonirwin.ca/2015/02/24/whats-a-tablet-for/"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; by internet acquaintance Jason Irwin (&lt;a href="https://alpha.app.net/matigo"&gt;@matigo&lt;/a&gt; on ADN) yesterday about how he doesn’t find tablets especially compelling. There were quite a few things he said in the piece that did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; resonate with me (and even a few suspicions I think are out and out incorrect), but generally on technology things like this I simply say: to each his own. So what follows is not so much a response to Jason’s post as some thoughts inspired by it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jason hit on a meme that’s been extremely common about tablets in general and iPads in particular: that you cannot do real work on them, only “consumption”. What is meant, nearly always, in such discussions, is that it is harder to write, develop software, and other keyboard-intensive activities using an iPad than a traditional laptop or desktop form factor. This is certainly true of &lt;em&gt;those&lt;/em&gt; activities. Even of a few other activities Jason mentions, iPads do &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; well.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; But there is another, more important issue here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We (quite readonably) tend to define productivity poorly in terms of output. In that sense, there are many categories for which the iPad is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; as capable as a laptop. It is true, for example, that I do not do a lot of writing or software development on my iPad (a retina Mini)—I’ll start drafts of blog posts (part of this was dictated on my iPhone!), and occasionally log into and do administrative work on a server via SSH using an iPad client. That doesn’t mean it isn’t a valuable device for me, though. It simply means that “valuable” and “productive” are not synonyms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Less helpfully, however, we also tends to define “value” in terms of “productivity”. People say that iPads are not valuable to them because they do not specifically allow them to be &lt;em&gt;productive&lt;/em&gt; in the sense outlined above… but then, there are a great many valuable things that are not producing content. I use my iPad daily for a wide array of things, and find it enormously preferable to a laptop for nearly all of them. True, many of them are “consumptive”—but since when did that become a bad thing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recognize that the answer may seem obvious against the backdrop of a consumerist culture against which many an anti-consumerism critique has rightly been levied. But think about what we mean by “consumption” in this case. Nearly every day I use my iPad both for reading and for displaying (and for learning) music. To be sure, I also watch the occasional YouTube video, interact on Twitter and App.net, and so on. But the vast majority of what I do with an iPad is best summed up as &lt;em&gt;learning&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Whether it is reading through a few carefully selected RSS feeds in &lt;a href="http://supertop.co/unread/"&gt;Unread&lt;/a&gt;, reading the news in &lt;a href="http://cir.ca"&gt;Circa&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; working through reading for school in iBooks,&lt;a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; perusing the &lt;a href="http://emberjs.com"&gt;EmberJS&lt;/a&gt; docs in preparation for a major project I’ll be starting with the tool in a few months, or reading the Bible every morning, I do a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of reading on my iPad. Add in the fact that I use it for music as I practice piano, and I get an awful lot of mileage out of it every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, none of this negates Jason’s post in particular. If he doesn’t get that kind of traction out of an iPad, that’s no skin off my back. But I do think that the criticism of devices which are primarily “consumptive”—perhaps implied in Jason’s post; certainly stated outright in many other responses to the iPad—is misplaced. Whether simply for entertainment (joy in the arts is good!) or in reading (joy in the arts &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; in self-betterment is good!) or in the myriad other ways that people put the iPad&lt;a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to use that are not making something new, there is value in the kinds of consumption done with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are there valid critiques to be offered of tablets, including that certain kinds of consumptive habits are problematic? Of course. But reducing things to their productive utility is ethically flawed, and reducing human pursuits to their productive output even more so. It is just fine if &lt;a href="https://alpha.app.net/matigo"&gt;@matigo&lt;/a&gt; isn’t the sort of guy who loves an iPad. It is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; fine if tech pundits want to slam the iPad and other tablets because they have a misanthropic view of human flourishing—and make no mistake, the utilitarian calculus so often levied against tablets is just that. People are more than what they make; their time is valuable even (and sometimes especially) when not producing anything tangible at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, his point about keyboards that differ for different applications has been addressed quite thoroughly in that market! Most music apps ship with music-oriented interfaces, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; traditional QUERTY-style keyboards.&lt;a href="#fnref1"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, in theory I could do that on another, less expensive device—but I had a Nexus 7 and nothing I have seen about Android tablets since then convinces me the Android tablet ecosystem has meaningfully improved in the last couple years. The experience factor in using things really does matter to me, and iOS gives me an enormously better experience in every category, even with its foibles and flaws, and nowhere more so than in the massively better app ecosystem.&lt;a href="#fnref2"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn3"&gt;&lt;p&gt;An app my friend &lt;a href="http://independentclauses.com/"&gt;Stephen Carradini&lt;/a&gt; and I like so much that we did a &lt;a href="http://www.winningslowly.org/2015/01/take-my-money-now/"&gt;whole episode&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://www.winningslowly.org/"&gt;Winning Slowly&lt;/a&gt; on it!&lt;a href="#fnref3"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id="fn5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yes, with plenty of other tablets, too! If you’re a Microsoft Surface person, that’s splendid as well.&lt;a href="#fnref5"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your current Firefox settings might make it hard to use Login Approvals. It’s probably because:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You sometimes clear your cookies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your browser is set to automatically clear cookies whenever it closes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You use your browser’s “private browsing” or “incognito” mode.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You’re using a new browser.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may take a few days after fixing these issues before you will be able to enable Login Approvals. You also may need to log out and then log in again after fixing these settings for the changes to take effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visit the Help Center for step-by-step directions on how to fix these settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use Firefox for the social media access I do online—and because I don’t like being tracked, I tell Firefox not to remember history and to delete cookies as soon as I close the browser, and I run &lt;a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock"&gt;μBlock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://disconnect.me/"&gt;Disconnect&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you attempt to enable 2-step login, Facebook checks your security policy… and &lt;em&gt;will not let you turn it on&lt;/em&gt; if your settings are like mine. They supply the message above, with no option to proceed anyway. Of course, there is no technical issue with using 2-step login with a browser configured this way. I use it for GitHub, Google, my domain registrar, and every other service with 2-step login.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook probably has two motives here. The better one is user experience: it &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; be frustrating if you are a non-tech-savvy user who doesn’t understand the consequences of setting this given the browser settings I have. But of course, if they were primarily just concerned with that, they could give the warning and then let users say, “Go ahead; I know what I’m getting into.” The second, less obvious but almost certainly more important motive from Facebook’s point of view, is to discourage people from using a browser the way I do. They want to be able to monetize my Facebook use better, and this means not just my time on Facebook, but my time all over the web. Facebook wants to know what I’m looking at any time I’m surfing &lt;em&gt;anywhere&lt;/em&gt; so that they can tailor their ads to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not interested in being tracked that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, Facebook isn’t interested in letting people have actual, modern security unless they’re willing to be tracked that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a problem here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, of course, people like me aren’t particularly valuable customers to Facebook anyway, so they probably don’t mind the fact that they’re losing more and more of our time. But losing that time they are. My use of Facebook is diminishing at an ever-increasing rate, for countless little reasons like this, where Facebook’s ad-driven motivations push them to treat me poorly. Too bad for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="refs" class="references"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;section class="footnotes"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If anyone tells you that blocking ads is “stealing”, they’re talking up nonsense. The Internet is built in such a way that if nothing else you can always just request the plain text version of a website, and that’s extremely important for many reasons, including accessibility. I &lt;em&gt;choose&lt;/em&gt; to leave ads on for any number of sites I want to support, but at the end of the day it’s every publisher’s choice how theyw ant to make money. If a newspaper supports itself with ads and coupons, I have every right to throw them in the trash without a glance; the same is true online.&lt;a href="#fnref1"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, I know this isn’t foolproof and I’m still being tracked. It’s impossible &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to be tracked to some degree or another. What I am doing here is &lt;em&gt;decreasing&lt;/em&gt; the degree to which companies can track me.&lt;a href="#fnref2"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

The review proper concludes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, Echoes of Eden says all the right things. Barrs has provided a healthy, sound theology of the arts, reiterating and synthesizing the helpful work of Schaeffer, Lewis, Tolkien, O’Connor, and Dostoevsky. What is more, his survey of English literature grounds that theology in concrete examples we can follow. This is a solid book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there was a bit more to say about this, because…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was one thing it lacked, though: beauty of its own. As Barrs himself says, “A book that is not well-written, no matter how compelling the story is, will not be reread multiple times” (114). I doubt I will read Echoes of Eden again, because this is true for non-fiction as well. Form matters. It may not be quite true that the way we say things is just as important as what we say—better to say the truth boringly than a lie splendidly—but it comes a close second. The truth is beautiful, and we should always aim to present it beautifully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think you’ll find the rest interesting! &lt;a href="http://mereorthodoxy.com/speak-truth-beauty-review-echoes-eden/"&gt;Take a look.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A note: I actually meant to have this reviewed about 18 months ago. I got buried in Greek III and it totally slipped my mind! Gladly, the folks at Crossway who sent me the book were understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

I resolved at the beginning of the year to write at least one update every month, though. I want these updates here for &lt;em&gt;myself&lt;/em&gt;, if for no other reason. (Then, of course, I promptly missed January, but this is counting for that; there will be another post here at the end of the month.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What have we been up to, you ask? Well, quite a lot! Since the last time I wrote a blog post, we had a baby, who is now crawling around. (If you’re reading this, you probably already know that, of course.) Ellie is talking, constantly practicing saying things the right way and asking the names of things; Kate is scooting around the floor exploring everything and is increasingly verbal herself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They love playing together. Ellie and Kate are good friends—a while back Jaimie heard Ellie quietly talking to Katie in the back seat of the car, repeating, “You’re my best friend, Kate.” Sometimes when Ellie gives Kate a hug and a kiss goodnight every night, Kate goes into the most adorable squeals of delight. Indeed, no one elicits those squeals as much as Ellie. In addition to her scooting around the floor, Kate is happily eating solid foods—and the girl &lt;em&gt;loves&lt;/em&gt; her food. Today I put her in her high chair and she started laughing as I put the tray in front of her. She often thumps the tray, the table, or the floor to express her joy. And last but not least, this little gal is &lt;em&gt;strong&lt;/em&gt;. Her favorite time is getting in a bouncer and jumping for as long as we will let her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/girls-games.jpg" title="My ladies playing Lego Star Wars"/&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
My ladies playing &lt;i&gt;Lego Star Wars&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have been teaching Ellie a lot. Jaimie has slowly started working through the ABCs with her. She can count to 5, and she knows her way to 10, but sometimes gets sidetracked along the way. She is learning her colors and spent a while defaulting to calling everything “pink”… except for her favorite &lt;em&gt;purple&lt;/em&gt; dress. In the last month, she has started being able to identify the colors more reliably, along with lots of shapes. She loves cars and trucks and especially buses and fire trucks. She sings to herself and dances all the time. She loves building with blocks. She is learning to say “please” and “thank you”—learning, in this case, not because she doesn’t know how but because she has started &lt;em&gt;forgetting&lt;/em&gt;. She is learning to pray and to sing to God and learning the answer to simple questions like, “Who made you, Ellie?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jaimie has continued to write off and on, though the first many months we had Kate it was much spottier than it had been. She’s working on secret projects that are making her happy, and that makes me happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for why she didn’t get as much time, I was &lt;em&gt;busy&lt;/em&gt; last semester. I picked up a second contract, building the new &lt;a href="//holybible.com"&gt;HolyBible.com&lt;/a&gt;, and between that and my ongoing contract work and my one class, I pulled a lot of 50–60 hour weeks. That’s not particularly an experience we are keen to repeat, but it was the right call at the time: we were able to save up the money to fill up our six-month emergency fund and to pay for the rest of seminary. This semester is going a bit easier: I am taking Hebrew III and Baptist History and working ~30 hours a week instead of ~50–55. I &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; my language classes; without a doubt Hebrew III and Greek III have been my very favorite classes since I started seminary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ran another half marathon in November, and set a PR at 1:25:37—a 6:32/mile pace. I was super happy with that outcome, and I plan to run the same race again for the third year in a row this coming fall, Lord willing. In the meantime, I have started swimming and cycling regularly with the aim of completing my first triathlon early this summer. (I’m going to stick to a short “sprint” tri to start, and work up from there.) While I love running, I would like to have the use of my joints in twenty (and forty, and sixty) years, and accordingly I need to make sure I do not keep putting over 1,000 miles a year on my legs. I have been going to a spinning class to get my legs in better cycling shape for the last month (and the last two weeks Jaimie has come with me!). We have also been doing a Pilates class weekly; my back needs to be a lot stronger and my legs a lot looser, and that is helping quite a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We continue to be extremely happy in our church here, FBC Durham. God has used our church to encourage and challenge us in a wide variety of ways—too many (and perhaps in many cases too subtle) even to summarize. We are excited to see what the years ahead hold for us there, as the church itself continues to flourish and grow and we seek opportunities to continue serving and building up this particular outpost of the body of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, life is &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;. It is not perfect, of course; I long for Jesus’ return and the New Heavens and New Earth more and more all the time. But we see God’s faithfulness and goodness in the hard months no less than in the easy ones. We see the Spirit working in our hearts to make us more like Christ, and it is good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could go on, but a thousand words is enough. More again, and sooner than the last gap!&lt;/p&gt;

(The first four paragraphs of this post are the same as the posts that spawned it.) And then, as so often happens with my writing, it rather took on a life of its own. So much for short.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After wrestling with Bitbucket issues again all day, I think I’ve finally hit the breaking point. Time to go ahead and drop the money on GitHub and migrate my private repos there. (Yes, GitLab is neat, but tool integrations matter, too.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I’m also probably going to spring for a small subscription to Pivotal Tracker. It’s cheaper to do GitHub+PivotalTracker at my scale than to host GitLab and run YouTrack on a VPS. And that’s &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; counting my time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big thing with Pivotal is that I &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; the ability to estimate more effectively even than something like Trello affords (and I don’t want to spend time wrangling with Chrome plugins), and it gives me that. Totally worth the cost in saved pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as for GitHub as compared to the free GitLab… well, honestly, the F/OSS-copycat model bothers me on a lot of levels. The fact that their strategy is “copy GitHub as closely as possible, and charge for it” is not my idea of “winning slowly”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(“Winning slowly” is more than just the name of my &lt;a href="//www.winningslowly.org"&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, it’s the opposite: we named the podcast that because it’s one of the core commitments in our lives.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I’m going to pay for Pivotal and GitHub. My time is worth something, and the quality of the tools I use matters, too. Ongoing irritation and frustration adds up over time. Good tools can make us happier. Bad tools can make work more frustrating than it needs to be. Given just how frustrating work can be anyway, the last thing in the world I want to do is unnecessarily spend my time being even more frustrated by my tools. And you know what? $7/month for each of those tools is absolutely worth more than the frustration of wrestling with tools that do the job less well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m actually really excited by this. Pivotal Tracker will help me avoid making the painful mistake of underestimation in the future, by helping me see how long things actually take and giving me a way to plan out major projects with that data immediately available. GitHub will be simultaenously more functional and much lovelier than Bitbucket—no strategy tax holding it back!—and will be much nicer to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, it comes down to this: I’m happy to pay for good tools that make my work more enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To my surprise and amusement, this leads me to a closely related point I had been writing up in a separate blog post: the value of tools that &lt;em&gt;delight&lt;/em&gt;. It is not merely that bad tools make work unpleasant. Good tools can make work a &lt;em&gt;joy&lt;/em&gt;. Indeed, because my vocations is such a significant part of my life, few things bring me as much simple pleasure as a tool that does its job well, is pleasant to use, and is beautiful, all at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest example of this for me is &lt;a href="//www.neat.io/bee/index.html"&gt;Bee&lt;/a&gt;, a tool designed to make working with issue trackers like JIRA, GitHub Issues, and FogBugz easier and more pleasant. I use JIRA for one of my long-term contracts—I actually set it up for the company—and I have a love-hate relationship with it. JIRA’s power is great, but the web interface is slow and cluttered.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have used other desktop tools with JIRA before, and they were even worse than the web interface. I stumbled across Bee the other day (I cannot even remember how!), decided to try it out, and fell in love. It is simple, fast, and &lt;em&gt;elegant&lt;/em&gt;. That is a killer combination. I have been using it daily for over a week, and strange though it might be to say of a desktop client for issue trackers, I get genuine pleasure out of using it. (Yes, I know: that is a bit strange.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have the same experience with a number of other tools I use—&lt;a href="//www.git-tower.com"&gt;Tower&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="//bywordapp.com"&gt;Byword&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="//www.jetbrains.com/idea/"&gt;IntelliJ IDEA&lt;/a&gt; to name just a few. This very post is written in Byword, and I’m &lt;em&gt;happy&lt;/em&gt; about it. I wish I felt that way about every tool I use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this goes beyond software. I have had the same experience driving a car. The Mazda3 I drove in and after college was a delight. The MUV&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; we drive right now is sufficient. The Chevy Malibu we rented for driving to and from Texas in December was &lt;em&gt;irritating&lt;/em&gt;, with an inordinate number of small failures to consider how the thing would actually be used. I would buy another Mazda3 in a heartbeat; I would contentedly take another Lexus RX300-alike; I would avoid a Chevy Malibu like the plague.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Every&lt;/em&gt; category of tool is like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference between a poor or mediocre tool and a good tool can make the difference between frustration and satisfaction. The difference between a good tool and a &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; tool can make the difference between satisfaction and delight. That inspires me: it makes me want to make things so that they do more than &lt;em&gt;suffice&lt;/em&gt;—so that they &lt;em&gt;excel&lt;/em&gt;, so that they delight and energize their audience. Whether that is someone using a web application I write or someone listening to a piece of music I composed, I want them to experience more than good-enough. I want them to feel joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is something profound here, I think, something that goes even deeper than just the experience of being happy enough with a good tool to pay money to use it. I think human beings are meant for that profound joy—meant for it in every breath. That these kinds of delights are rare, and so often marred even at their best by little failures, is a mark of the imperfection—and, in human terms at least, the &lt;em&gt;imperfectibility&lt;/em&gt;—of the world in which we live. But the fact that such moments will be rare until the eschaton neither undoes nor diminishes the imperative to strive after them—especially for those of us who, as Christians, affirm the goodness and the &lt;em&gt;telos&lt;/em&gt; of the created world. Quite the contrary. We have a responsibility and a charge as subcreators always to be able to say of the work we have done, “It is good.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not there yet. I hope very much, though, that the work I do this year will be—for at least one person—a little sip from that deep well of delight. Whether I succeed or no, at least the bar is set where it ought to be.&lt;/p&gt;

While New Years’ resolutions can be silly and get us in trouble (when we set unrealistic goals, or unhelpful goals), the turning of the year can also be a helpful time to evaluate the way we spend our time and the things we want to accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What follows is a list of public-ish things I am &lt;em&gt;hoping&lt;/em&gt; to manage in 2015, in no particular order. Come the end of the year, I will Lord willing look back and see which of these I was able to pull off!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publish at least two seasons of &lt;a href="//www.winningslowly.org"&gt;Winning Slowly&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="//stephencarradini.com"&gt;Stephen Carradini&lt;/a&gt; just as we did last year—but better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get the site for Winning Slowly updated so that it paginates between seasons! This means writing an extension for &lt;a href="//docs.getpelican.com/en/3.5.0/"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt; that can paginate on something besides page count. An excuse to write Python? I call that winning.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Migrate Jaimie’s &lt;a href="//jaimiekrycho.com"&gt;Jaimie’s professional writing website&lt;/a&gt; from WordPress to &lt;a href="//ghost.org"&gt;Ghost&lt;/a&gt;. (Maybe do something similar with her current &lt;a href="//jaimiedawn.blogspot.com"&gt;personal site&lt;/a&gt;, which runs on Blogger. Yuck.) I’ve gotten a bit of a start on that already, and I hope to knock it out sooner rather than later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get to a point where I’m hosting all my own sites on my own DigitalOcean droplet (or similar). I’ve been moving that direction slowly but steadily anyway—whereas I started and ran for a long time on simple shared hosting, I’ve been using &lt;a href="https://www.webfaction.com/?aid=67929"&gt;Webfaction&lt;/a&gt; for a good chunk of the past year, and now am pretty well ready to take the plunge this year into just running my own server. No skin off their backs; Webfaction has been great, as was &lt;a href="https://billing.stablehost.com/aff.php?aff=319"&gt;StableHost&lt;/a&gt; before them. I’m just ready to be in control (even with the bit of extra maintenance that entails).&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Write at least three minutes of music, and post it to my &lt;a href="//soundcloud.com/chriskrycho"&gt;SoundCloud&lt;/a&gt; account. Preferably five minutes, but at least three.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Write some poetry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Write a substantive essay and post it at least once a month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Post at least a half dozen book reviews (which, among other things, means reading at least a half dozen books worth reviewing). These can be fiction or non-fiction. Personally, I’d like to get everything from Dostoevsky to Schreiner in there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add a picture to my &lt;a href="/about"&gt;About&lt;/a&gt; page!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Post a &lt;a href="/family"&gt;#family&lt;/a&gt; update at least once a month. It’ll be good for &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;, just to have a better way of tracking what’s going on with our little gals, and I know my family would enjoy it, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In sum, I’d like to be doing &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; in nearly every public-facing category in which I’m interested. Maybe it won’t be a lot, but keeping my musical skills doing matters to me. Keeping my brain engaged on a wide variety of topics matters to me. Keeping my writing skills sharp matters to me. I cannot &lt;em&gt;excel&lt;/em&gt; at all of those things, certainly—especially not if I wish to be a good husband and father! But keeping them active means keeping them from further atrophying, and that is something, at least. It will hopefully leave them more available to me for times in the future when I am able to dedicate more time to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If 2014 and 2013 were both years in which I focused primarily on software—and all to the good!—then I hope 2015 will be a year in which I am able to broaden out again and focus on a wider variety of things!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll note that there really aren’t any purely personal goals on this list. Not to worry: I have them, and I intend to formalize them in the next couple of days. But one of the things I have learned over the many years I have been blogging is that not everything needs to be public. Some things can be; indeed, some &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be. Some things &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; be public but &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; not, and yet others &lt;em&gt;should not&lt;/em&gt; be public. Right now, I am choosing to leave quite a few things in the “may be need not” category private. (This direction, I can always change my mind later. It’s essentially impossible to do the opposite in the internet era.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Startling”: this is the best word I can find for the doctrine of the Incarnation. It is the most surprising of all the miracles. Every miracle is a surprise, of course; it would not be a miracle otherwise. Still, there is something uniquely and specially striking about this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God became a man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C. S. Lewis called this the central miracle of the Christian faith, the miracle on which all others depend: if this one happened, then of course all the others are possible. What is feeding a few thousand people with five loaves and two fish compared to the transcendent One becoming immanent? What is healing a centurion’s dead servant, set next to the Creator squealing at his mother’s breast? What is walking on water or calming a storm, for the God who took up the image of the image of God? Not to make little of these miracles—they are in no way trivial or light. But the Incarnation stands apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the resurrection of the Son of God is less surprising than his birth. Now, we must never minimize Jesus’ resurrection. It is the means of our justification and the basis all our hope. It is the rock beneath our joy in the long and painful days that stand between us and our own restoration. Its enormity remains. Still, it seems to me less astonishing than the Incarnation. Death has always been an interloper; its reign was always temporary. Once God had taken up this frail form, it seems almost unthinkable that he would &lt;em&gt;fail&lt;/em&gt; to raise it from the dead. But the Creator-God wrapping himself in creature-hood was never something we could have guessed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look closer. The wonders—the strange, delightful paradoxes—mount up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God does not change. The Father and the Son and the Spirit are as ever they have been: perfectly united, delighting in each other, needless and complete. And yet, in that marvelous moment in Mary’s womb, there was a permanent change. The Son was then, is now, and will forever be, a human being. He never ceased to be eternal God—not for a moment—but now he is also everlasting man. It was the first and only beginning in the being of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God is spirit; he dwells in unapproachable light; no eye can see him and no hand touch him. Jesus the Messiah, though, is a human being through and through. He is David’s descendant, and Judah’s, and Abraham’s, and Noah’s, and Adam’s. He is not invisible at all. Nor is he merely a hologram, an image without the substance of the thing. Other hands touched him, in hope and in hate. His own hands grew blisters when he first learned to use a hammer at his father’s side, touched in healing and forgiveness, were pierced with real nails, still had holes Thomas could when he was raised. His feet had calluses from walking the dusty roads between Jerusalem and Judea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Triune Godhead is not taught and does increase in understanding. All knowledge is his from forever to forever. Yet Jesus learned. He grew in wisdom and stature and favor with God and man; he learned obedience through what he suffered and so became perfect. The immortal, invisible, only wise God took up a mortal body that died, displayed prominently for all to see, in the supreme act of foolishness as the world judges such things. When it was finished, he did not cast away the body as so much detritus. He kept it and raised it gloriously new, beautiful and undying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God needs nothing. He is totally, completely self-sufficient. Everything that has ever existed or ever will exist, he created, and without his sustaining power everything would immediately cease to exist. He does not sleep, and never needs to eat. The Father worked through the Son to create all things, and it is in the Son that all things hold together. Yet when he walked this earth he ate and slept and had to put away his body’s waste. It was not the appearance but the reality of need. He was both a little boy getting thirsty as he ran around the hot streets of Egypt, and the one who ensures the water that would refresh him continued to exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God is holy. He is unassailably good, perfectly just, unfailingly righteous—and Jesus’ family history is a series of portraits of human sin: an adulterous murderer, a Canaanite woman of ill repute, a man who slept with his daughter-in-law, and more than a few who worshipped carved-up rocks and trees instead of God. We were made in the image of God, the mirror of divinity, but the humanity the Son took up was shattered and dirtied beyond recognition. Theh body the Son took was not one crafted not to share our weaknesses; it was like ours in every way. &lt;em&gt;This&lt;/em&gt; flesh he baptized, and this flesh divinized. We have come to share truly in the nature of God because God came and shared truly all the nature of man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Creator joined with his own being a created, broken thing. Of course every sad thing must now begin to come untrue. If that restoration comes slower than we might hope, we can sense its inevitability nonetheless, like slow-growing vines spreading cracks in some great edifice. The walls will fall—maybe not today, and maybe not tomorrow, but they will fall. Human being, has been joined once more to divinity, as it was meant to be from the beginning. Someday we will be right again—maybe not today, and maybe not tomorrow, but we will be right again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every miracle is a surprise, but the Incarnation of the Son of God astounds us at every turn, until it makes every other surprise seem all-but-inevitable. When unchanging God has undergone a permanent change, invisible God has become forever visible, unneeding God has experienced need, unlearning God has learned, immortal God has come to die in a mortal body—what does “impossible” even mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Word became flesh and dwelt among us. Old things are gone. All things are new. Glory to God in the highest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For as when a figure painted on wood has been soiled by dirt from outside, it is necessary for him whose figure it is to come again, so that the image can be renewed on the same material—because of his portrait even the material on which it is painted is not cast aside, but the portrait is reinscribed on it. In the same way the all-holy Son of the Father, being the Image of the Father, came to our place to renew the human being made according to himself, and to find him, as one lost, through the forgiveness, as himself says in the Gospels, “I came to seek and save the lost” (Lk 19.10)…. So, rightly wishing to help human beings, he sojourned as a human being, taking to himself a body like theirs and from below—I mean through the works of the body—that those not wishing to know him from his providence and governance of the universe, from the works done through the body might know the Word of God in the body, and through him the Father….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now then, if they ask why he did not appear through other more noble parts of creation, or use some nobler instrument, as the sun or moon or stars or fire or air, but merely a human being, let them know that the Lord came not to be put on display but to heal and to teach those who were suffering. One being put on display only needs to appear and dazzle the beholders; but one who heals and teaches does not simply sojourn, but is of service to those in need and appears as those who need him can bear, lest by exceeding the need of those who suffer he trouble the very ones in need and the manifestation of the divine be of no benefit to them….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Properly, therefore, the Word of God took a body and used a human instrument, in order to give life to the body and in order that, just as he is known in creation by his works, so also he might act in a human being, and show himself everywhere, leaving nothing barren of his divinity and knowledge. Again, I repeat, resuming what we said before, that the Savior did this in order that as he fills everything everywhere by his presence, so also he might fill all things with the knowledge of himself, as the divine scriptures say, ‘The whole earth was filled with the knowledge of God’ (Isa 11.9).&lt;/p&gt;

I needed to be more productive—a lot more. Happily, I have been, and it only took three small changes.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="use-a-to-do-list" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Use a To-Do List&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making a list of items to accomplish has been incredibly helpful. I started using &lt;a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/"&gt;OmniFocus&lt;/a&gt; in August for class due dates and any work tasks not tracked in other ways.&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; At that point, I organized everything—a bit too much, actually. Over the last couple months, I took some good advice I have seen in a number of places:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not over-organize. Most tasks can go in a simple inbox.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hit your due dates. Making it a habit to hit every due date will help you not to miss important tasks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not put due dates on things that do not need them. You will eventually stop paying attention to them—and also to the due dates that &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; matter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I try to knock out a few small things from my Inbox every day, and hit all the due dates I set for myself. I am missing fewer things, getting more things done, and getting them done sooner than I did before. I like my app, but I know people who have just used an old-fashioned planner. The trick is to find a strategy that works for you.&lt;a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="email-is-not-a-to-do-list" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Email Is &lt;em&gt;Not&lt;/em&gt; A To-Do List&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point, I got in the habit of using my email as a to-do list. In theory, seeing a list of unanswered emails every day should have motivated me to respond to them. In reality, they just sat there and slowly piled up. At best, they nagged at me. At worst, I basically forgot them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started using OmniFocus, I killed this habit. Now I make a task for anything I need to act on, and I delete or archive everything else.&lt;a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; If the task is time-sensitive, I put a due date on it; otherwise, my third rule above applies. I also have a repeating task reminding me to empty my inbox at the end of each day (“Inbox Zero”). Having an empty inbox at the end of every day removes a certain amount of mental baggage: I have a task for everything I &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to act on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="take-breaks" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Take breaks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I have started using the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique"&gt;“pomodoro”&lt;/a&gt; technique. The basic approach is to work steadily for 25 minutes, then take a 5 minute break.&lt;a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; After four such cycles, I take a slightly longer break—usually 15 minutes. On each break, I walk around and do something unrelated to whatever I am working on. I also write down a brief summary of what I did on that cycle.&lt;a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; There is nothing complicated about this: I just use a simple timer to track the work and break cycles.&lt;a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I have seen a &lt;em&gt;dramatic&lt;/em&gt; improvement in my ability to sustain my concentration on my tasks throughout the day since I started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few reasons for that improvement. First, I have dedicated break times, so I know that I can go check social media, read tech and news sites, etc. &lt;em&gt;later&lt;/em&gt;. That makes it easier to concentrate on work for the blocks in between; the distractions can wait. Second, it puts a limit on those break times. We have all been surprised to find we have lost an hour reading online; using a timer helps prevent that. Third, getting up and moving around helps keep my brain active—I can tell that the movement considerably improves my alertness and concentration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These breaks have other benefits, too. There is mounting evidence that sitting all day is terrible for our health. Even exercising as much as I do &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/04/25/135575490/sitting-all-day-worse-for-you-than-you-might-think" title="Sitting All Day: Worse For You Than You Might Think"&gt;cannot fully counteract&lt;/a&gt; a sedentary lifestyle. However, there is also evidence that getting up and moving on a regular basis &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; help. Walking briskly, I usually manage a fifth or a quarter of a mile on a five-minute break. That adds up over the course of a day: if I am disciplined about walking on my breaks, I regularly walk 2–3 miles in a day, even with lunch and other non-walking breaks in the mix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have also found the breaks spiritually helpful. One of the requirements for my pastoral ministry internship was to memorize Ephesians. Five-minute breaks are &lt;em&gt;perfect&lt;/em&gt; for memorizing and reviewing Scripture, so I was able to be productive on those breaks, even while letting my brain relax from my other work. It is similarly useful for dedicated times of prayer throughout the day. The combination of scripture memory and prayer has been invaluable in combatting sin and stirring up my affections for Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, I get a triple benefit by doing pomodoros. I am more productive when I am working, my body will remain healthier because I am less sedentary, and I am growing in holiness and intimacy with God. Of all the changes I made this semester, incorporating pomodoros into my day has been the most important, and I plan to make it a regular part of my life henceforth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is just what I do. It may not work for you. It may even drive you crazy.&lt;a href="#fnref1"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id="fn3"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While &lt;a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/"&gt;OmniFocus&lt;/a&gt; suits me, I would recommend &lt;a href="https://en.todoist.com/"&gt;Todoist&lt;/a&gt; to most people instead: it is less expensive and easier to use, and while it does not do &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; OmniFocus does, it can easily do everything most people need.&lt;a href="#fnref3"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn4"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I archive order confirmations, messages from friends, and work conversations, and delete everything else.&lt;a href="#fnref4"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why the 25/5 pattern? That seems to be a limit in human cognition; it lines up closely with research on student attention spans in the classroom.&lt;a href="#fnref5"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This helps me see what I have done over the course of a day and gives me a sense of progress. It is also extremely useful when writing up a weekly report for an employer.&lt;a href="#fnref6"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn7"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have used &lt;a href="http://www.tomighty.org/"&gt;Tomighty&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pomodoro-one/id907364780?mt=12"&gt;Pomodoro One&lt;/a&gt;, which are both free and work well. The app is not the point, though: an old-fashioned kitchen timer will do just as well.&lt;a href="#fnref7"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

He is one of &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; pastors. This makes the task of writing a critical book review somewhat strange. On the one hand, I wanted to write this review as I would any such. On the other hand, I wanted to take care to show respect to a man whom God has used to shepherd me and my family for the past two years since we moved to North Carolina, and whom I regard very highly for his faithfulness in serving the church gathered as First Baptist Church of Durham. I hope I have struck the balance appropriately. And as I hope will become clear, though there were a few places where this book could be stronger, it is nonetheless extraordinarily valuable. I have been challenged and indeed have grown in holiness because of having read it. I commend it to you.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An Infinite Journey: Growing toward Christlikeness&lt;/em&gt;, by Andrew M. Davis, Greenville: Ambassador International, 2014, 480 pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="overview" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Davis’ &lt;em&gt;An Infinite Journey&lt;/em&gt; is a careful, thorough, heavy exploration of the doctrine and practice of sanctification in the Christian life. Davis, the long-time pastor of First Baptist Church in Durham, North Carolina and an adjunct professor at nearby Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary, has clearly dedicated considerable time and consideration to the topic of holiness and growth in the Christian life, and this consideration is on display throughout what is ultimately a very helpful book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Davis begins by introducing the concepts which permeate the rest of the book: the saving work of God in Christ and the Christian’s lasting dependence on the Holy Spirit. Perhaps surprisingly (at least to the casual reader), he opens not with the topic of sanctification, but with justification, arguing that all real Christian growth must be predicated on a right understanding of the gospel. Thus, he spends some time tracing out the story of salvation, culminating in Christ’s atoning death on the cross and resurrection, and his institution of the church and sending the Holy Spirit to save and then shape the internal lives of Christians throughout the ages. He further argues that all Christians are involved in two “infinite journeys”—the external journey of evangelism and discipleship, and the internal journey of growth in holiness. Both, he notes, are essential for the health of the Christian: to be deficient in either is to demonstrate either ignorance or hard-heartedness toward the things of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this introduction, Davis turns to a map of the second of these journeys: the internal path of growing Christ-likeness. His thesis is that sanctification is a four-part process, involving a continuous sequence of knowledge, faith, character, and action, each feeding into the next. Knowledge of God produces faith; increasing faith produces Christlike character; a more Christlike character results in more Godward actions; and those Godward actions in turn lead to a greater knowledge of God himself. Davis dedicates a section of the book to each of these ideas, examining in detail Scriptural support for the concept and then examples of the element in the lives of figures in Scripture, especially Christ. Finally, he turns to a section dedicated to application, looking at the knowledge-faith-character-action cycle as a whole in both Scripture and a variety of day-to-day scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="analysis" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Davis’ treatment of the doctrines of sanctification is thorough and compelling, most of all because it is drenched in Scripture. Early in the book, Davis explicitly spells out his commitment to the centrality, sufficiency, and authority of Scripture, and the text of the book backs this up. It is common to hear authors affirm the importance of Scripture; it is rare to see it so born out so clearly in their writing. Even apart from the explicit references on nearly every page, the text bears the unmistakable imprint of Davis’ own practice of memorizing books of the Bible. Allusions, near quotes, and implicit references to Scripture appear multiple times on nearly every page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Scriptural emphasis leads to the book’s other great strengths. First, Davis makes no point without basing the assertion on Scripture, and he draws on every section of the Bible to demonstrate the importance of each aspect of his map for growth in holiness. Moreover, he follows Scripture’s lead in grounding sanctification in the work of Christ mediated to us by the Holy Spirit. Davis’ emphasis on the work of the Spirit is especially helpful. Though he is by no means a charismatic in the modern sense of the word, it is clear that he is gripped by the reality that sanctification simply does not happen without the work of the Holy Spirit. This is an essential corrective for two kinds of churches: those tempted to ignore the Spirit, and those tempted to ignore all the works of the Spirit apart from those that result in visible signs. Rightly, Davis’ doctrine of sanctification is trinitarian: holy people whole-heartedly worship the Father in Spirit-empowered dependence on the finished work of the Son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, this Scriptural care allows Davis to navigate the difficult topic of Spirit-dependent human effort that characterizes Biblical sanctification. Because sanctification is the one aspect of salvation in which people are called to work (e.g. in Phil. 2:12), many believers are tempted to treat sanctification as a wholly human endeavor. Davis repudiates this notion, showing again and again that sanctification—like the justification that precedes it and the glorification that will follow it—is ultimately a work of God and one that brings him all glory. No person will be able to claim the credit for their own sanctification before God at the day of judgment. At the same time, he also rejects a Keswickian spirituality (“let go and let God”), even when dressed up as mere gospel dependence. However much in vogue the notion may be that we can do nothing and God does everything for us, it is simply not true. God requires us actively to seek him and his holiness. Davis rightly recognizes both these dangers and charts a course between them. The pursuit of holiness is empowered by the Holy Spirit, and believers must always fix their eyes on the finished work of Christ and the promise of future glory. Yet believers keep their eyes on Christ and rely on the Spirit &lt;em&gt;to work&lt;/em&gt;—not to sit still and trust God to float them toward holiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book does have a few weaknesses. First, although the book’s length and thoroughness are valuable in many ways, they also make this a difficult sell for anyone who is not already a dedicated reader. Moreover, while much of the length was inevitable in a work this thorough on a topic this complex, the book could be substantially shorter were it edited more carefully. Trimming the lengthy introduction and removing some repetition, unnecessary explanations, and clarifications would make the work stronger as well as shorter and more approachable. Given Davis’ goals—to stir up believers to pursuing holiness—this would be profoundly helpful, as it would allow for the book to be used in a broader variety of contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, a number of Davis’ references to words’ meanings in Greek are either extraneous or inaccurate. In particular, he regularly committed the so-called etymological fallacy, ascribing meaning to words based on their components rather than their actual use in the language. (This led him several times to disagree with every modern major translation!) He also sometimes referenced English words derived from Greek terms, but in cases where the derivation is irrelevant to the present meaning of the English word (e.g. &lt;em&gt;poem&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;em&gt;poiema&lt;/em&gt;). Gladly, no major issues in the text hung on these cases. Nonetheless, the misuses were distracting, and since in most cases they were also unnecessary, they actually &lt;em&gt;weakened&lt;/em&gt; the book for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That these are the only significant issues in such a large and thorough book is a significant achievement, and both could readily be addressed in future editions of the work. Taken as a whole, Davis’ book shines. As Davis points out, holiness necessarily entails both knowledge of the things of God and zeal for his glory. The book drips with Davis’ passion for God and his urgent desire that God’s people seek holiness, and it lays out a thoughtful and (most importantly) Scriptural plan for how his people shall become holy. Lord willing, the volume will be a reliable guide to sanctification for the church for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A week and a half ago, I started on a plan that will get me through the entirety of the Bible in ninety days. I’ve enjoyed it and—much more importantly—found it very helpful spiritually. My personal devotional time has been spotty the last few months, and I needed to make it a more regular part of my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem was simple: I didn’t have a plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, feeling like an idiot. I’m very well aware in nearly every &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; area of my life how important a plan is. I don’t go running without a basic idea of where I want to go, and in a larger sense I don’t train for a half marathon without a basic idea not only of what my running schedule will be like for the season but also what my strategy ought to be. Nor do I tackle a semester’s worth of work without a schedule. Nor do I try to build a significant piece of software without charting out the basic approach I’ll take (and sometimes a good deal more than just the basic course). I would be silly to think I would be successful in training for a race, passing my classes, building an application, or much else in life without a basic plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why, then, I have acted like I could succeed spiritually without that kind of discipline is beyond me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is, when I have a plan—nearly any plan!—for reading the Bible, I can stick to it and my devotional life tends to be fairly consistent. As anyone who has been a Christian for some time knows, personal devotions are profoundly helpful. They help us see the face of God more clearly and keep in focus the spiritual realities of our lives. We &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; that, given the tendency of the human heart to drift off into apathy toward our King. Apathy is dangerous. Sin is always ready for us to let down our guard and stop wholeheartedly pursuing God. Slacking off—in our meditations on his word, our prayer life, or our fellowship with the saints—will lead us steadily to ruin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not so much the details of a Bible-reading plan that matters, then. It is that I have a plan, so that I stay on target. In this case, I am reading a great many chapters a day, seeking to get a grasp on the big picture of the Bible. In another, I might be working slowly through a book, trying to understand its pieces and parts and details. In yet another, I might simply read and meditate and pray over the same psalm every day for a month. The point is to seek God— diligently, hungrily, passionately; not to let up in pursuing holiness in conformity to the image of his Son; to chase the knowledge of th eholy more than I have ever chased a half marathon PR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I have been an idiot by failing to plan, and have been in and out of my regular devotional times, God has still been merciful to me in other means of grace: the preaching of the word, personal prayer, Scripture memory, and so on. But I am glad to have a plan. I am glad to be seeking him that much more diligently. Lord willing, I shall keep it up.&lt;/p&gt;

I distinctly did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; like writing it. Every time I sat down to deal with it, I found myself in a tangled mess of plain JavaScript, jQuery, and DOM manipulations that inevitably left me tearing my hair out.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I found it difficult to write in the first place, and even harder to maintain in the long run. I could not come up with good ways to organize it, especially because so much of what I was doing was so thoroughly &lt;em&gt;ad hoc&lt;/em&gt; in nature. Cobble this together over here; scrounge together those things over there; hope nothing collides in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last four months, I have written several thousand lines of JavaScript, and I have &lt;em&gt;loved&lt;/em&gt; it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my latest major project, relaunching &lt;a href="https://holybible.com"&gt;HolyBible.com&lt;/a&gt;, I wrote the front end in &lt;a href="https://angularjs.org"&gt;AngularJS&lt;/a&gt; and the back end as an &lt;a href="http://expressjs.com"&gt;Express&lt;/a&gt; app (the most popular &lt;a href="http://nodejs.org"&gt;NodeJS&lt;/a&gt; web framework). I’ve written gobs of tests in &lt;a href="http://jasmine.github.io"&gt;Jasmine&lt;/a&gt; (using &lt;a href="https://github.com/mhevery/jasmine-node"&gt;jasmine-node&lt;/a&gt; for server-side tests) and drawn on tons of other open-source packages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I have &lt;em&gt;loved&lt;/em&gt; it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A small example: a moment ago, looking up the link for Jasmine, I noted that the latest version released today. My response was, “Ooh—cool!”&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What changed? Well, mostly I changed, but also JavaScript changed a bit. We both grew up over the last four years. On the JavaScript side of things, a lot of good design patterns and tools have come into play in that span. I’m sure there were plenty of good, disciplined web developers writing clear, careful, well-organized client-side JavaScript four years go. But in the interval, that kind of JavaScript got a lot more prominent, in part because it has had help from the rapid rise of server-side JavaScript in the form of Node.js and its flourishing ecosystem of components and tools. Build tools like &lt;a href="http://browserify.org"&gt;Browserify&lt;/a&gt; and development tools like &lt;a href="http://livereload.com"&gt;LiveReload&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://incident57.com/codekit/"&gt;Codekit&lt;/a&gt; have combined with best practices learned from those long years of jQuery/DOM-manipulation hell so that these days, good JavaScript is a lot like good programming in any other language: highly modular, carefully designed, and well-organized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same period of time, I have matured enormously as a developer (just enough to see how far I still have to go, of course). At the point where I most hated JavaScript, I also really struggled to see the utility of callbacks. Frankly, it took me the better part of a month just to get my head around it—most of the tutorials out there just assumed you understood them already, and, well: I didn’t. Functions as first-class members of a language was new to me at that point. Fast-forward through several years of full-time Python development, lots of time spent reading about software development and some harder computer science concepts, and my perspective on JavaScript has shifted more than a little. Closures are beautiful, wonderful things now. Functions as arguments to other functions are delightful and extremely expressive. Prototypal inheritance—trip me up though it sometimes still does—is a fascinating variation on the idea of inheritance and one that I think I like rather better than classical inheritance.&lt;a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are still things I don’t love about JavaScript. Its syntax owes far too much to the C family of languages to make me happy; I quite like the way that CoffeeScript borrows from Python (white-space-delimited blocks, use of equality words like &lt;code&gt;is&lt;/code&gt; and boolean rules like &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt; rather than &lt;code&gt;===&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; respectively, etc.). And I am looking forward to a number of features coming in the next version of JavaScript—especially generators and the &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; keywords, which will allow for &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; saner patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But all of that is simply to say that I am now starting to know JavaScript enough to know that its &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; issues aren’t the surface-level differences from the other languages with which I’m familiar. They’re not even the warts I noted here. They’re things like the mix of classical and prototypal inheritance in the way the language keywords and object instantiation work. But I don’t mind those. Every language has tradeoffs. Python’s support for lambdas is pretty minimal, despite the utility of anonymous functions, for example. But I &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; the tradeoffs JavaScript makes.&lt;a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, I discovered the same thing so many other people have over the last few years: JavaScript isn’t just a good choice for utilitarian reasons. Beneath that messy exterior is a gem of a language. I’m having a lot of fun with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="refs" class="references"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;section class="footnotes"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus the early balding starting by my temples.&lt;a href="#fnref1"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My wife’s bemused response: “Is that &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; language?” Take that as you will.&lt;a href="#fnref2"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn3"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The couple weeks I got to spend &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/a-little-crazy.html"&gt;playing&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="http://iolanguage.org"&gt;Io&lt;/a&gt; certainly helped! Io’s prototypal inheritance is semantically “purer” than JavaScript’s, which is quite an improvement in my view. JavaScript’s &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt; keyword and the pseudo-classical object pattern it brings along can go rot in a bog.&lt;a href="#fnref3"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn4"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Truth be told, I like them even better from the perspective of CoffeeScript, which hides a lot of the rough edges of JavaScript and, as noted above, brings in quite a few things I like from Python. For my part, I intend to write as much CoffeeScript as possible going forward.&lt;a href="#fnref4"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

For simplicity’s sake, let us assume the four following files:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;main.c&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;secondary.c&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;writer.h&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;calculator.h&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project has many more files than this, of course, but these are the important ones for demonstrating this particular piece of insanity (which shows up &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; places in the codebase).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m reproducing here some dummy code representing an &lt;em&gt;actual set of relationships in the codebase&lt;/em&gt;. The functions and module nameshave been changed; the relationships between the pieces of code have not.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; When I started trying to build the program that included what I am representing as &lt;code&gt;main.c&lt;/code&gt; below, this is the basic structure I found:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="main.cpp" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;code&gt;main.cpp&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the main module of the program. In the actual code in which I found this particular morass, it was actually code generated by the UI builder in Visual Studio 6&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and then turned into an unholy mess by a developer whose idea of good programming involved coupling the various parts of the code as tightly as possible.&lt;a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="c"&gt;&lt;code&gt;#include &amp;quot;calculator.h&amp;quot;
#include &amp;quot;secondary.h&amp;quot;

int a=0, int b=0;

int addNumbers(a, b) {
    return a+b;
}

void doBadThingsWithGlobals(int * someNumber) {
    a = 6;
    *someOtherNumber = 5;
}

#include &amp;quot;writer.h&amp;quot;

void main() {
    a = 3;
    doBadThingsWithGlobals(&amp;amp;b);
    addNumbers(a, b);
    doStuffWithNumbers(a,b);
    subtractNumbers(b, a);
}

// More insanity follows...&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, the main function and the &lt;code&gt;doBadThingsWithGlobals&lt;/code&gt; function are both modifying global state, and yes, there is an include statement midway down through the module. (Just wait till you see what it does.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="secondary" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;“secondary”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a secondary module which has been somewhat cleaned up. It has normal relationships between header and source files, and includes all its dependency headers at the top of the file. It has a header which defines the public API for the module, and that even has inclusion guards on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="secondary.h" class="level4"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;code&gt;secondary.h&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;pre class="c"&gt;&lt;code&gt;#ifndef SECONDARY_H
#define SECONDARY_H

int doStuffWithNumbers();

#endif SECONDARY_H&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="secondary.c" class="level4"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;code&gt;secondary.c&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;doStuffWithNumbers&lt;/code&gt; function here calls &lt;code&gt;addNumbers&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="c"&gt;&lt;code&gt;#include &amp;quot;secondary.h&amp;quot;
#include &amp;quot;calculator.h&amp;quot;

int doStuffWithNumbers(int x, int y) {
    addNumbers(x, y);
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But wait!&lt;/em&gt; you say, &lt;em&gt;That function isn’t defined here!&lt;/em&gt; Ah, and you would be right, except that it doesn’t refer to the &lt;code&gt;addNumbers&lt;/code&gt; function in &lt;code&gt;main.c&lt;/code&gt;. It refers to a function implementation in &lt;code&gt;calculator.h&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="calculator.h" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;code&gt;calculator.h&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre class="c"&gt;&lt;code&gt;int addNumbers(int p, int q) {
    return p + q;
}

int subtractNumbers(int r, int s) {
    return r - s;
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strangely, this &lt;code&gt;addNumbers&lt;/code&gt; function is identical to the one in &lt;code&gt;main.c&lt;/code&gt;. Even &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; strangely, it is defined—not merely declared, actually defined—in the header file! Nor is this the only such function. Look at the details of &lt;code&gt;writer.h&lt;/code&gt;, which was mysteriously included above in the middle of the main module.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="writer.h" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;code&gt;writer.h&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre class="c"&gt;&lt;code&gt;void writeStuff() {
    fprintf(stdout, &amp;quot;a: %d, b: %d&amp;quot;, a, b);
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, we have a full-fledged implementation in the header file. Why, you ask? Presumably because the developer responsible for writing this code never quite got his head around how C’s build system works. The entirety of one of the central components of this software—an element that in any normal build would be a common library—was a single, approximately 2,000-line &lt;em&gt;header file&lt;/em&gt;. (Say hello to &lt;code&gt;calculator.h&lt;/code&gt; up there; that’s what I’m abstracting away for this example.)&lt;a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worse: it is printing the values of &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;, and no, I am not skipping some part of &lt;code&gt;writer.h&lt;/code&gt;. It is getting those from &lt;code&gt;main.c&lt;/code&gt;, because it was included after they were defined, and the build process essentially drops this header inline into &lt;code&gt;main.c&lt;/code&gt; before it compilation.&lt;a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; So here we have a header file with the implementation of a given piece of code, included in a specific location and defined in such a way that if you change where it is included, it will no longer function properly (since the variables will not have been defined!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worse, there are conflicting definitions for one of the functions used in &lt;code&gt;main.c&lt;/code&gt;, and because of its dependency on &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; functions in &lt;code&gt;calculator.h&lt;/code&gt; (e.g. &lt;code&gt;subtractNumbers&lt;/code&gt; in this mock-up), it cannot be removed! Moreover, given the many places &lt;code&gt;calculator.h&lt;/code&gt; is referenced throughout the code base, it is non-trivial to refactor it.&lt;a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this sounds insane… that’s because it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re curious how I dealt with it, well… I renamed the &lt;code&gt;addNumbers()&lt;/code&gt; function in &lt;code&gt;main.c&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;_addNumbers()&lt;/code&gt; and put a loud, angry &lt;code&gt;TODO&lt;/code&gt; on it for the current release, because the only way to fix it is to refactor this whole giant mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The takeaway of the story, if there is one, is that people will do crazier, weirder, worse things than you can possibly imagine when they don’t understand the tools they are using and just hack at them till they can make them work. The moral of the story? I’m not sure. Run away from crazy code like this? Be prepared to spend your life refactoring?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How about: try desperately &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to leave this kind of thing for the person following you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="refs" class="references"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section class="footnotes"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s actually not &lt;em&gt;wholly&lt;/em&gt; true, because these pieces of code are also duplicated in numerous places throughout the codebase. We’ve eliminated as many as possible at present… but not all of them, courtesy of the crazy dependency chains that exist. Toss in a dependency on Visual Studio 6 for some of those components, and, well… suffice it to say that we’re just happy there are only two versions floating around instead of the seven that were present when I started working with this codebase two and a half years ago.&lt;a href="#fnref1"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Visual_Studio#Visual_Studio_6.0_.281998.29"&gt;&lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Visual Studio 6. The one from 1998. Yes, that’s insane. No, we haven’t managed to get rid of it yet, though we’re close. So close.&lt;a href="#fnref2"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn3"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am not joking. Multi-thousand line functions constituting the entirety of a program are not just &lt;em&gt;normal&lt;/em&gt;, they are pretty much the only way that programmer ever wrote. When you see the code samples below, you will see why: someone was lacking an understanding of C’s build system.&lt;a href="#fnref3"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn4"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, that’s the piece of code of which I found seven different versions in various places when I started. Seven!&lt;a href="#fnref4"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I once ran into some code working on a different project for an entirely different client where there had been a strict 1,000-line limit to C source files, as part of an attempt to enforce some discipline in modularizing the code. Instead of embracing modularity, the developers just got in the habit of splitting the source file and adding &lt;code&gt;#include&lt;/code&gt; statements at the end of each file so that they could just keep writing their non-modular code.&lt;a href="#fnref5"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have tried. Twice. I’m hoping that the third time &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; be the charm.&lt;a href="#fnref6"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doctrine is not merely an affair of the tongue, but of the life; is not apprehended by the intellect and memory merely, like other branches of learning; but is received only when it possesses the whole soul, and finds its seat and habitation in the inmost recesses of the heart…. To doctrine in which our religion is contained we have given the first place, since by it our salvation commences; but it must be transfused into the breast, and pass into the conduct, and so transform us into itself, as not to prove unfruitful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div id="refs" class="references"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chris Krycho</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2014 23:02:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:www.chriskrycho.com,2014-11-04:2014/doctrine.html</guid><category>quotes</category></item><item><title>Nailed It</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/nailed-it.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, something rather remarkable happened. Someone leaked a copy of the trailer for &lt;em&gt;Avengers: Age of Ultron&lt;/em&gt;… and Marvel, rather than throwing a hissy fit, just tweeted:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dammit, Hydra. (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Marvel/status/525071656306626560"&gt;October 22, 7:50 PM EST&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pitch perfect. It’s self-aware, self-&lt;em&gt;referential&lt;/em&gt; in a funny way without being too clever-seeming or coming off like it’s trying too hard, and just a generally good response. The team could have fought it (though ultimately that would have just made things worse), but instead Marvel played its hand perfectly. The response was was funny &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; demonstrated that the folks who work there actually understand how the internet works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That alone would have been good enough to put Marvel in a league of its own when it comes to managing things &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; going the way hoped for. But (after what I’m sure was considerable back-room wrangling), they followed it up an hour and a half later with another, equally fantastic tweet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here it is! Watch the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Avengers"&gt;@Avengers&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AgeofUltron?src=hash"&gt;#AgeofUltron&lt;/a&gt; Teaser Trailer right NOW: &lt;a href="http://youtu.be/tmeOjFno6Do" class="uri"&gt;http://youtu.be/tmeOjFno6Do&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Avengers?src=hash"&gt;#Avengers&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Marvel/status/525093857772318720"&gt;October 22, 9:18 PM EST&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your average old-media company these days would have thrown a fit and made a stink about the release of their media. They would have done everything in their power to get the video taken down. Many companies &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; done just that under similar circumstances, aiming to get the trailer, snippets of the movie, music, or the like removed from the internet. But that simply isn’t how the internet works: it famously “treats censorship like damage and routes around it” (&lt;a href="http://www.chemie.fu-berlin.de/outerspace/internet-article.html"&gt;John Gilmore&lt;/a&gt;). Once a video is online, it’s online. Someone, somewhere, still has a copy of it and can put it back up. So rather than fight it… Marvel just rolled with it and made the best of the situation. They cracked a joke, went ahead and put the trailer out themselves, and earned general approval from the internet. Again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite being a decades-old company, Marvel is clearly a new media company through and through at this point. They managed to dodge the &lt;a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2013/04/economist-explains-what-streisand-effect"&gt;Streisand effect&lt;/a&gt; quite nicely, turning what could have been an opportunity for hostility all around into a PR coup and a win that they couldn’t have scored on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other old (and new!) media companies, take note. &lt;em&gt;This&lt;/em&gt; is the way you play the game. You recognize when the cat is out of the bag and you run with it. Own it. Make it your own somehow. Don’t let it own you. The internet is a big, crazy, chaotic place, and you can never hope to control it—nor even the narrative about you and your stuff, whatever that may be—like you might have been able to do twenty-five years ago. But that’s okay. If you can roll with the punches, you can still come out ahead, and you’ll look a little more human doing it. I call that winning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Go Marvel.)&lt;/p&gt;

To be sure, software development is &lt;em&gt;far&lt;/em&gt; better with &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; of the distributed version control systems in play—the three big ones being &lt;a href="http://git-scm.com"&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com"&gt;Mercurial&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;code&gt;hg&lt;/code&gt;), and &lt;a href="http://bazaar.canonical.com/en/"&gt;Bazaar&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;code&gt;bzr&lt;/code&gt;), with a few other names like &lt;a href="http://www.fossil-scm.org"&gt;Fossil&lt;/a&gt; floating around the periphery—than it ever was in a centralized version control system. There are definitely a few downsides for people converting over from some standard centralized version control systems, notably the increased number of steps in play to accomplish the same tasks.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; But on the whole, the advantages of being able to commit locally, have multiple complete copies of the repository, and share work without touching a centralized server far outweigh any downsides compared to the old centralized system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being so, my opening statement remains true, I think: &lt;em&gt;The current state of affairs in version control is a mess.&lt;/em&gt; Here is what I mean: of those three major players (Git, Hg, and Bazaar), each has significant downsides relative to the others. Git is famously complex (even arcane), with a user interface design philosphy closely matching the UI sensibilities of Linus Torvalds—which is to say, all the wires are exposed, and it is about as user-hostile as it could be.&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; It often outperforms Hg or Bazaar, but it has quirks, to say the very least. Hg and Bazaar both have &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; better designed user interfaces. They also have saner defaults (especially before the arrival of Git 2.0), and they have better branching models and approaches to history.&lt;a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; They have substantially better documentation—perhaps especially so with Bazaar, but with either one a user can understand how to use the tool &lt;em&gt;without having to understand the mechanics of the tool&lt;/em&gt;. This is simply not the case with Git, and while I &lt;em&gt;enjoy&lt;/em&gt; knowing the mechanics of Git because I find them interesting, &lt;em&gt;having&lt;/em&gt; to understand the mechanics of a tool to be able to use it is a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the other systems have their downsides relative, to Git, too. (I will focus on Hg because I have never used Bazaar beyond playing with it, though I have read a good bit of the documentation.) Mutable history in Git is valuable and useful at times; I have rewritten whole sequences of commits when I realized I committed the wrong things but hadn’t yet pushed.&lt;a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Being able to commit chunks instead of having to commit whole files at a go is good; I feel the lack of this every time I use Hg.&lt;a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Needing to understand the &lt;em&gt;file system&lt;/em&gt; that Git invented to make sure you do not inadvertently destroy your repository is… not so good.) A staging area is nice,&lt;a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (even if &lt;em&gt;having&lt;/em&gt; to stage everything manually can be in the pain in the neck&lt;a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, then, there was no clear winner for this generation. Each of the tools has significant upsides and downsides relative to the others. Git has become the &lt;em&gt;de facto&lt;/em&gt; standard, but &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; because of its own superiority over the alternatives. Rather, it won because of other forces in the community. Mostly I mean &lt;a href="https://github.com"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, which is a &lt;em&gt;fantastic&lt;/em&gt; piece of software and easily the most significant driving factor in the wider adoption of Git as a tool. The competition (&lt;a href="https://bitbucket.org"&gt;Bitbucket&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://launchpad.net"&gt;Launchpad&lt;/a&gt;) are nowhere near the same level of sophistication or elegance, and they certainly have not managed to foster the sorts of community that GitHub has. The result has been wide adoption of Git, and a degree of Stockholm Syndrome among developers who have adopted it and concluded that the way Git works is the way a distributed version control system &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not. Git is complicated to use and in need of tools for managing its complexity; the same is true of Hg and Bazaar, though perhaps to a slightly lesser extent because of their saner branching models. This is what has given rise to the &lt;a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/"&gt;plethora&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html"&gt;different&lt;/a&gt; formal &lt;a href="https://about.gitlab.com/2014/09/29/gitlab-flow/"&gt;workflows&lt;/a&gt; representing various attempts to manage that complexity (which have been &lt;a href="https://bitbucket.org/yujiewu/hgflow/wiki/Home"&gt;applied&lt;/a&gt; to other systems &lt;a href="https://andy.mehalick.com/2011/12/24/an-introduction-to-hgflow"&gt;as well&lt;/a&gt;). Managing branching, linking that workflow to issues, and supplying associated documentation for projects have also cropped up as closely associated tasks— thus the popularity of GitHub issues and Bitbucket wikis, not to mention &lt;a href="http://www.fossil-scm.org"&gt;Fossil’s&lt;/a&gt; integration of both into the DVCS tool itself. None of the tools handle differences between file systems very elegantly (and indeed, it took &lt;em&gt;years&lt;/em&gt; for Git even to be useable on Windows). All of them especially struggle to manage symlinks and executable flags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there is an enormous opportunity for the &lt;em&gt;next&lt;/em&gt; generation of tools. Git, Hg, and so on are huge steps forward for developers from CVS, Visual SourceSafe, or SVN. But they still have major weaknesses, and there are many things that not only can but should be better. In brief, I would love for the next-generation version control system to be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;distributed (this is now a non-negotiable);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fast;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;well-documented—&lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; as well as Hg is, and preferably as well as Bazaar is;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;well-designed, which is to say having a user interface that is actually a user-interface (like Hg’s) and not an extremely leaky abstraction around the mechanics;&lt;a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fast;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;file-system oriented, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; diff-oriented: this is one of Git’s great strengths and the reason for a lot of its performance advantages;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;extensible, with a good public API so that it is straightforward to add functionality like wikis, documentation, social interaction, and issue tracking in a way that actually integrates the tool;&lt;a href="#fn9" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref9"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and last but not least, truly cross-platform.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is a non-trivial task, but the first DVCS that manages to hit even a sizeable majority of these desires will gain a lot of traction in a hurry. The second generation of distributed version control has been good for us. The third could be magical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;section class="footnotes"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A point that was highlighted for me in a conversation a few months ago with my father, a programmer who has been using SVN for a &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt; time and found the transition to Git distinctly less than wonderful.&lt;a href="#fnref1"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone who feels like arguing with me on this point should go spend five minutes laughing at the &lt;a href="http://git-man-page-generator.lokaltog.net"&gt;fake man pages&lt;/a&gt; instead.&lt;a href="#fnref2"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn3"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Few things are as hotly debated as the relative merits of the different systems’ branching models and approaches to history. At the least, I can say that Hg and Bazaar’s branching models are &lt;em&gt;more to my taste&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;a href="#fnref3"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn4"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, there are extensions that let you do this with Hg, but they are fragile at best in my experience, and substantially less capable than Git’s.&lt;a href="#fnref4"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, I know about Hg’s record extension. No, it is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; quite the same, especially because given the way it is implemented major GUI tools cannot support it without major chicanery.&lt;a href="#fnref5"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, I know about Hg’s queue extension, too. There is a reason it is not turned on by default, and using it is substantially more arcane than Git’s staging are. Think about that for a minute.&lt;a href="#fnref6"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn7"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, there is the &lt;code&gt;-a&lt;/code&gt; flag. No, I do not want to have to remember it for every commit.&lt;a href="#fnref7"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s be honest: if Git’s abstraction were a boat, it would sink. It’s just that leaky.&lt;a href="#fnref8"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn9"&gt;&lt;p&gt;GitHub does all of this quite well… but they have had to write heaps and gobs of software &lt;em&gt;around&lt;/em&gt; Git to make it work.&lt;a href="#fnref9"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Now: on to the post’s business!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;section id="clarifying-remarks" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Clarifying Remarks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;section id="the-point-of-this-post" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The point of this post&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want you to walk away persuaded that there is room for a (much) wider degree of disagreement on the age of the earth and the details of creation than many evangelical and fundamentalist leaders sometimes assert—and indeed, that this has been the case historically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; particularly interested in persuading you that my particular view of the age of the earth is correct, or indeed that you ought to change your views at all. I just want you to walk away with an appreciation for the points to consider on the topic, and hopefully encouraged about the open door for future development of Christian thought on this complex and interesting issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="my-take" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;My take&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me get a few things out of the way, right up front—I want you to know where I am coming from:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I believe the Bible is God’s revelation of himself to us, and that when we read the Bible we are actually reading God’s word. As such, I affirm the inerrancy of Scripture. I do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; necessarily affirm anyone’s favorite articulation of that important doctrine.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am an old-earth creationist. I affirm that the universe is most likely somewhere in the neighborhood of 14 billion years old, that the earth formed about 5 billion years ago, and that there is an enormous well of geological history from which there actually are things Christians can learn.&lt;a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I do not in principle have an issue with God having used nearly any means to bring about the present biological state of the world we observe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I believe that Adam and Eve really did commit original sin, leading all of humanity into the bondage from which Jesus Christ delivered us in his incarnation, life, death, resurrection, and ascension.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I do not see these position as inherently contradictory—though many of my friends, peers, and even pastors disagree.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I think that Christians run two serious risks in this area: capitulating to the assertions of a world that we know to be hostile to the things of God, and rejecting real God-given knowledge and wisdom in ways that unnecessarily compromise our witness and cause us to miss out on things God wanted us to know about himself and his world. While the former of these risks is indeed more serious, ignoring the second risk puts us in hot water quite regularly as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, onto the meat of the post!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="the-boundaries" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Boundaries&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This discussion is complicated by several major issues. First, readings of Genesis 1–11 have been enormously varied over the history of the church. Second, the narratives directly intersect with scientific data in ways that much of the rest of the Scriptures do not. Closely related to this is a third point: the complexity of the essential texts themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="history" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;History&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this first bit: suffice it to say that the church’s view of the days of creation has been extremely &lt;em&gt;varied&lt;/em&gt; over the last two thousand years. It is common today to hear evangelical leaders (notably including but not limited to Al Mohler and Ken Ham) suggesting that denial of six 24-hour days of creation is tantamount to a denial of the inerrancy of Scripture. In the history of the church, such a position is novel, to say the least. In addition to the oft-cited Augustine quote on the matter, countless others have affirmed non-24-hour day views.&lt;a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Importantly, this number includes such modern luminaries as B. B. Warfield and J. Gresham Machen—no wobbly-kneed capitulators to modernism or feeble falterers on inerrancy they, but both affirmed the “day-age” view of the days of creation, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; six 24-hour days.&lt;a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be sure, simply pointing to authorities’ takes on the position does not tell us what Scripture teaches (and indeed to do so is to commit the fallacy of argument from authority!), but it &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; provide us with a degree of caution in making pronouncements about the bounds of orthodox opinion. More, it ought to give us pause when we start to identify our own interpretations with the bounds of orthodoxy or even the bounds of inerrancy. It is perfectly reasonable to suggest that those who have gone before us were mistaken (as indeed I think some of them were). It is something else entirely to suggest that they were not only mistaken but were all of them somehow rejecting the inerrancy or authority of Scripture simply because their positions do not accord with our own. In particular, when Warfield and Machen affirm an old earth, we would do well to recognize that any interpretation of inerrancy which excludes dogmatically an old earth is inherently problematic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note well: I am not making here any comment at all on what the age of the earth is, nor even on whether we should or should not affirm an old earth view is within the bounds allowed by Scripture. I am simply calling for a dose of humility in the face of the reality of centuries of witness that differ from the line taken by many evangelicals and fundamentalists today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="scripture-and-science" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Scripture and Science&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are only a few areas in which the things the Bible says intersect directly with the findings of natural science. This is one of them. To be sure, there are many ways in which God’s revelation informs (or at least, should inform!) Christians’ view of the world around us and the value of scientific undertakings. Moreover, our affirmation of a supernatural character to the world means we will reject certain ideologies—hard naturalism is simply an untenable stance for us. That being said, though, the early chapters of Genesis are one of the only places in Scripture where the natural sciences and the Bible speak directly to the same issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Genesis, we have an account of the creation of the world and the origin of humankind. The natural sciences&lt;a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; also give us an account of the creation of the world and the origin of humankind. Whether the two do or can be made to agree is one of the major points of contention not only among Christians but also between many secularists and believers: simply witness the barbed critiques of Christianity at the hands of the New Atheists over the last decade, many of them aimed directly at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In most conflict-ridden areas of our lives and public witness, Christians stand opposed to the &lt;em&gt;moral&lt;/em&gt; positions of the world around us. In this area, we stand at least potentially in opposition to an quite different aspect of the world: the pursuit of natural knowledge. True: all orthodox Christians grant that the human mind is in some ways “fallen” and therefore unable to properly apprehend all truth. At the same time, we &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; affirm that even the fallen mind is the mind of a being made &lt;em&gt;imago dei&lt;/em&gt; and situated in a world made rationally by a wise God. We believe that we see in the “book of nature” the handiwork of our creator, and in our own minds the apex of that creation. We affirm that there is a great body of knowledge available to all human beings, that our minds still allow us to understand the world around us &lt;em&gt;rightly&lt;/em&gt; even if incompletely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than that, we believe that it is precisely because of God’s handiwork on display that all humans stand accountable before him; Paul reminds us that we are all without excuse because creation itself points to the existence of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We therefore ought to hesitate before suggesting that the many scientists who have read th book of nature to suggest an old earth are simply victims of the fall. It is one thing to suggest that the evidence can be misread: of course this is so. It is something else to suggest that nearly all astronomers and geologists, Christian and non-Christian alike, are simply deluded. This is an incredibly strong claim, and the evidence is on those who would advance it to back it up—not simply to assert it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality is that we face an area of tension here. The most straightforward reading of Genesis 1–11 is that of a young Earth which was covered in a worldwide flood. The most straightforward reading of the natural record is of an ancient Earth scarred by many catastrophes (but not, as near as we can tell, a global flood). These two readings stand in tension with each other. It is easiest to collapse the tension one way or the other: to dismiss modern science as a dangerous delusion, or to dismiss the early chapters of Genesis as mere mythology. I think &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; of these are missteps, and both fail to do justice to the seriousness which the topic deserves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="public-witness" class="level4"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Public Witness&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One corollary of this is that our stance on the relationship between science and Scripture impinges on our public witness in unique ways. When as believers we suggest that all of modern science’s readings of the book of nature are delusional, we are doing more than critiquing the findings of that science. We are speaking of those who &lt;em&gt;conduct&lt;/em&gt; the science. The timbre of much discussion of non-young-earth views among evangelicals and fundamentalists is one of implicit or explicit suspicion that “those secularists” are waging a war against the truth. I heartily affirm that there really are spiritual forces at work opposing the truth of God—both internal and external to human nature itself. That being said, perhaps we ought to be careful when asserting that the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; reason someone might disagree with our reading of Genesis 1–11 is Satanic delusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We unnecessarily hinder our witness when we make disagreement on this point a matter of conspiracy or willful opposition to the truth. Whether the young-earth creationist is right or wrong, the assumption that those who disagree with him are conspirators or blinded by lies is astoundingly arrogant. It leaves no room whatsoever for the notion that one &lt;em&gt;might actually be wrong&lt;/em&gt;. It is far more profitable to grapple with the tensions in our positions, whatever those positions may be.&lt;a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Failing to do unnecessarily leaves us without any credibility at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me be clear: I am willing to be taken as non-credible by the world around me. Wherever Scripture demands that we stand against the world, I will do so. My question is simply this: Does Scripture demand that here? Or is it simply &lt;em&gt;my interpretation&lt;/em&gt; that demands it? If the latter, it behooves me to offer others a more charitable interpretation.&lt;a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Perhaps they are not hostile conspirators or pitiably deluded fools after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a friend of mine (who characterizes himself as ‘an empirical agnostic atheist’) put it some months ago:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would have a lot more respect for that group [Ken Ham and Anwers in Genesis] if they could just say “we believe that Earth is only a few thousand years old, and we recognize that our current scientific understanding strongly indicates otherwise, but at this time we just can’t reconcile the discrepancy” instead of “secularist have hijacked science to mislead you into thinking Earth is older than it actually is.”&lt;a href="#fn9" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref9"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is right: it takes a great deal more humility to say, “Look, I recognize the trouble with my position, and I hold it nonetheless” than to say, “There is no trouble with my position!” in the face of all evidence to the contrary. We can facilely pretend that any opposition we receive is simply the result of our faithfulness to the truth—or we can recognize that sometimes, we &lt;em&gt;earn&lt;/em&gt; hostility from the world because of our own lack of charity and superciliousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(For the record, that has been me, too many times to count. I am not pointing my finger at young-earth creationists here; I am pointing it right at the man in the mirror. I have alienated my fair share and then some of non-Christians by my intransigence and my accusatory attitude. God forgive me.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The old earth creationist has to face up to the fact that his reading of the Bible is less natural than the young earth creationist’s. The young earth creationist has to face up to the fact that her reading of the world is less natural than that of the old earth creationist’s. Can we not simply be so honest as to admit as much? All of our positions have weaknesses. One of them is right (or at least, &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; right), and we can hold them confidently and even boldly—but we do not need to assume that those with whom we differ are either the victims or the perpetrators of some conspiracy to hide the real truth.&lt;a href="#fn10" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref10"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="textual-issues" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Textual Issues&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crux of this issue in many ways is what exactly the text says in Genesis. On this, I want again to suggest not that you embrace my particular interpretation but that you recognize the need for humility in dealing with the particular passages in question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is common among young-earth creationists to assert that the days of Genesis 1 are &lt;em&gt;obviously&lt;/em&gt; meant to be taken as literal 24-hour days. Those holding this view point to the use of the Hebrew word &lt;em&gt;yom&lt;/em&gt; translated “day” here. The word most commonly refers to 24-hour days, and all but one other time when put in context with the words for “evening” and “morning” which punctuate the text in Genesis (“and there was evening, and there was morning, the first day…”) certainly refer to such a span.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there are a number of reasons why we should be cautious in making such an assertion with any degree of dogmatism. First, the very first time &lt;em&gt;yom&lt;/em&gt; appears after this is Genesis 2:4, where it very certainly does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; refer to a 24-hour period. Second, the days certainly were not all &lt;em&gt;solar&lt;/em&gt; days if we take the passage at face value. (This is not to say they were not 24 hours long, only that the first three were apparently not solar days per the straightforward reading of the text.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, and most important, is the question of genre. There is a clear and distinct shift in language between the elevated prose of Genesis 1 and the more normal historical narrative language of Genesis 2 and following.&lt;a href="#fn11" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref11"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The first chapter is not poetry, but it makes heavy use of standard Hebrew poetic devices, especially repetition, in ways that set it off from what follows. The clear shift between the two should caution us&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="conclusion" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of room for disagreement on the specifics of this issue. While there are some lines we should not cross, those lines are much broader than some evangelical and fundamentalist leaders often suggest. One can be a thoroughgoing evangelical with a deep commitment to the inerrancy of Scripture and believe the earth old and even—dare I say it—that God used gradual means to bring about the biological diversity of the planet.&lt;a href="#fn12" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref12"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Whether affirming the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framework_interpretation_(Genesis)"&gt;Framework Hypothesis&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="http://biologos.org/resources/multimedia/john-walton-on-understanding-genesis" title="John Walton on Understanding Genesis"&gt;functional account of origins&lt;/a&gt; interpretation, a &lt;a href="http://www.desiringgod.org/articles/science-the-bible-and-the-promised-land"&gt;preparation of the land&lt;/a&gt; view, a &lt;a href="http://www.reasons.org/explore/topic/age-of-the-earth"&gt;day-age&lt;/a&gt; view, or with the Fathers yet other readings, there are &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; legitimate ways of reading Genesis 1 apart from literal 24-hour days, and all of them within the bounds not only of orthodoxy but also of the affirmation of inerrancy.&lt;a href="#fn13" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref13"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="refs" class="references"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section class="footnotes"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also do not think that one must affirm inerrancy to be a healthy Christian—though I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; think it is quite helpful and important, I do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; think it is essential for salvation or indeed for a great deal of sanctification.&lt;a href="#fnref1"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, I have not spent enough time thinking carefully about the ramifications of e.g. the Chicago Statement on Inerrancy to know whether I can affirm it meticulously.&lt;a href="#fnref2"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn3"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those of you “in the know” I basically take John Sailhamer’s “preparation of the land” view of Genesis 1.&lt;a href="#fnref3"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn4"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want a detailed exploration of the history of the church’s intepretation of the creation account in particular for its first millennium and a half, see Robert Letham, “‘In the Space of Six Days’: The Days of Creation from Origen to the Westminster Assembly,” WTS 61:2 (1999) 149–174.&lt;a href="#fnref4"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warfield helped formulate our modern explications of the doctrine, and Machen was one of its firmest defenders in the modernist controversy that embroiled the American denominations early in the 20th century; he quite literally stands at the head of the fundamentalist tradition that spanned the 20th century.&lt;a href="#fnref5"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;And particularly, what used to be called “natural history,” as my friend &lt;a href="http://www.vernonking.org"&gt;Vernon King&lt;/a&gt; pointed out in a recent conversation.&lt;a href="#fnref6"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn7"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For my part, I have to deal with the fact that the most straightforward reading is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the old-earth reading of the text, and &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; with the difficulty of reading something besides an actually global flood in the Flood narrative. I fully grant that this is the weakness of my position.&lt;a href="#fnref7"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;More on this below in the &lt;a href="#textual-issues"&gt;Textual Issues&lt;/a&gt; section below.&lt;a href="#fnref8"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn9"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Private correspondence with Jerrad Genson, February 12, 2014.&lt;a href="#fnref9"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn10"&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yes: here I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; calling out Ken Ham a bit. Every time he and his fellow travelers assert that the evidence &lt;em&gt;obviously&lt;/em&gt; points to a young earth and a global flood, they are being remarkably uncharitable to anyone who disagrees with them—and remarkably arrogant.&lt;a href="#fnref10"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn11"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note: this still very much leaves the old-earth creationist with problems with the Flood and Noah’s Ark, which are part of the latter, historical section. It is difficult, if not impossible, to draw a strong line between the literary character of Genesis 2–11 and that of Genesis 12ff.&lt;a href="#fnref11"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn12"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A final aside, with &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; intent to be provocative: consider that given the physical limitations of the ark Noah built, God &lt;em&gt;certainly&lt;/em&gt; had to engage in a massive program of theistic evolution to repopulate the earth after a global flood. See &lt;a href="https://answersingenesis.org/natural-selection/speciation/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for an example of the sort of evasion of the issue that goes on at Answers in Genesis dealing with precisely this issue. This is the worst sort of hair-splitting. Again: we should have the intellectual integrity to admit the weaknesses of our positions.&lt;a href="#fnref12"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn13"&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Michael Gungor, who sparked this whole discussion this time around— To be clear, I think Michael Gungor is mistaken about Genesis 1–11. I think a mythologizing reading of those chapters is textually misguided and spiritually unhelpful. But I also think that he might have landed in a position more like the one I embrace—a position that affirms both the inerrancy of Scripture &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; an old earth—if such an option had been presented to him coherently, rather than ruled out by young earth creationists as just as heretical and dangerous as the mythological view. I do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; think Michael Gungor is a heretic; I simply think he is wrong on this in ways that may set his feet on an unhelpful trajectory—and I hope that he might have conversations with folks who can help him come to reconcile the inerrancy of Scripture with an old earth.&lt;a href="#fnref13"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

We’re slowly modernizing the codebase and writing all our new code in Python (using NumPy, C extensions, and so on for performance where necessary). Occasionally, I just want to bang my head against the wall because there are things we can do so simply in any modern language that you just can’t do in any straightforward way in C. For example, I have file writers that all work &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; the same way, with the single exception that the format string and the data that you put into it vary for each file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Python, this would be straightforward to handle with the class machinery: you could simply specify the format string in each inheriting class and define the data points to be supplied at the top of an overriding function, call the parent function with &lt;code&gt;super()&lt;/code&gt; and be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do something similar in pure C is nearly impossible. You can supply a format string with each function (or module, or however you separate out the code), and if you feel especially clever you could convert all your data types to strings and pass them as a list to be printed by the standard function. The net result would be &lt;em&gt;longer&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;less maintainable&lt;/em&gt; than simply having a set of essentially-duplicate functions, though.&lt;/p&gt;

In the last eight hours, I have gone from jubilant to the most worried I have ever been to simple, utter exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This afternoon, I heard back from a then-potential and now-actual client who hired me and a friend to design and build a web application for them. They are going to pay us a substantial sum to do it. This is &lt;em&gt;fantastic&lt;/em&gt;. I have been hoping this particular opportunity would come through, because everything about it is appealing to me. It is an interesting application; I like the material it involves (a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt;); I will learn a bit along the way; I will get to stretch my front-end design chops again; I will make some seriously good money at it. I am, in a word, stoked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward four and a half hours. Jaimie and I are helping Ellie wrap up her evening activities and getting ready to take her upstairs and put her to bed. Kate is lying in a little sleep-rocker—her favorite spot to sleep during the day. She makes a bit of a coughing noise; we note it but think little of it (babies &lt;em&gt;often&lt;/em&gt; make that kind of noise). A few minutes later, Jaimie is walking by and glances at Kate. Our baby girl is bright red and turning purple. She grabs her. “Kate! Breathe! Breathe, little girl!” She isn’t breathing; she is getting upset but she isn’t crying. (Babies cry at the drop of a hat.) Little bubbles at her mouth. Jaimie is doing the baby variation of the Heimlich maneuver. I am nearly helpless; I keep using my finger to pull Kate’s mouth open; she finally latches onto the finger, starts sucking, and breathes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hold her. She breathes—&lt;em&gt;mostly&lt;/em&gt; normally. We keep paying close attention to her. The couple times I let her lay down on her back she starts seizing up and turning red again within a few minutes until I pick her up and pat her vigorously and she calms down again. We manage to get Ellie in bed. We call the doctor; she sends us to the hospital. A friend comes to watch Ellie and we run out the door. It is a 30-minute drive (and I am speeding, and Jaimie is holding Kate to make sure she keeps breathing).&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Kate wheezes off and on the whole way there. She still isn’t crying, and she should be. She hasn’t eaten in six hours; she should be hungry. Why isn’t she hungry?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They admit us. They get all her vitals. The doctor is a kind, soft-spoken man with the last name Saad; I like him. He asks dozens of good questions. He tells us, “95–99% of the time, this is just reflux. We just care about that other 1% of the time.” There is no reliable way to stop a baby from choking on milk she spits up because of reflux.&lt;a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; They are going to do an EKG and chest X-rays just to make sure she is okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She seems to be okay. She is eating again—like a champ, like she normally does, like she should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I go home to relieve the wonderful friends who are sitting in our house to make sure Ellie is fine. Ellie is still sleeping. Good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breathe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whiplash. I am no less excited about that project. And my youngest daughter almost died tonight. Had she started choking while we were upstairs, or while we were all asleep tonight, God only knows what would have happened. We are grateful to God that we were feet away from Kate, that Jaimie “happened” to look at her just then. We are grateful, too, for the extra money coming in; it will help with the so-very-worth-it-but-not-easy-on-a-seminary-budget cost of an emergency room visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ice cream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I’m going to sleep now. Hopefully tomorrow is less extreme.&lt;/p&gt;

That is always an unpleasant experience, to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one upside to this whole affair? I took away two important lessons: The first was a reminder to read others generously, even when frustrated with them—a point I spelled out a bit in my &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/dont-be-rude.html#edit-and-addendum"&gt;edit-and-addendum&lt;/a&gt; to the original post. The other about the effect of certain rhetorical structures in my writing. The &lt;em&gt;idea&lt;/em&gt; I had here was good (even if I may have misread the trigger for writing the post in the first place), but it was badly executed, and there were &lt;em&gt;structural&lt;/em&gt; reasons for that, having to do with the weight and balance in the original piece. What follows is just me self-critiquing in public: learning about the process of writing “out loud”, as it were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the example I am critiquing is specifically a blog post, a lot of the principles here apply equally to other media, including forms as varied as long-form essays, preaching, lecturing, and even writing fiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="my-goals" class="level4"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;My Goals&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I meant the story I offered as an illustrative example of a broader point. To wit, I had had a bad customer experience with a given company, and it left a bad taste in my mouth that pushed me away from using that company’s software in the future. The story was meant to illustrate that even a single bad experience with a company can emotionally outweight a lot of positive experience with the company, and that emotions tend to fade slowly over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="my-approach" class="level4"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;My Approach&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I approached the piece with a fairly typical rhetorical structure for this kind of thing: introduce a thesis or idea, detour through a specific example to illustrate it, then come back and drive the main point home. This was a good idea, but the execution failed, and it failed for fairly obvious reasons on reflection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="the-problems" class="level4"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Problems&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first problem was the distribution of the content. The original piece was right around a thousand words long. Of those, some six hundred words were devoted to specific details of my interaction with the company in question. Another hundred words had to do with my follow-up decisions about the products involved. In the whole piece, then, I spent over two thirds of my time talking about the specific example, and only about a third making the actual point I wanted to make. This weighted the content so that the focus was on the details of the story, rather than the bigger picture issue that I walked away with a bad taste in my mouth from my interactions with the company’s customer service representative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the story itself was &lt;em&gt;far&lt;/em&gt; too specific for my aims. I put in quotes from our email exchange, which entirely distracted from the point I wanted to make. It led readers to see whether they also perceived the emails as I had. While this was helpful for leading me to reevaluate the content of the emails, it also completely undercut the point of the post—a point, I should note, whose validity is entirely independent of the details of the incident I used to illustrate it. When I am illustrating a point, I need to let the illustration do the work of &lt;em&gt;illustrating&lt;/em&gt;, without letting the details of the illustration come to the fore in this way. That means eliding all details but those actually essential to make the point. The story isn’t the point, nor are its details. It is there to serve the end of the thesis, and nothing more. The minute it does more than that, it needs to get out of the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="lesson-learned" class="level4"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Lesson learned&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those two issues combined to shift the rhetorical effect from what I intended—a general discussion of the need to make sure you treat customers with respect—to something else entirely. Instead of making my point, the example distracted from it. I hope in the future to learn from this by doing two things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keeping the emphasis on arguing for the thesis, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; on an illustration present only to personalize the thesis, especially by keeping the length of the illustration down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keeping the details of any illustration used to the minimum essential to make the point at hand (whether illustrating the whole argument or just one part of it).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;Note&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have left the original post here as I wrote it, but there is an important &lt;a href="#edit-and-addendum"&gt;addendum&lt;/a&gt; at the bottom of the post that you should make sure to read (and note in particular the &lt;a href="#further-addendum"&gt;further addendum&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post came off as pretty critical of MarketCircle, and that &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; wasn’t my point. I wanted to use a bad experience I had with MarketCircle to illustrate a general principle, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to poke at any particular company. I did that poorly in this particular piece; for some follow-up on that see &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/i-wrote-it-wrong.html"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; which I wrote later that day, analyzing how and why this piece so spectacularly failed to accomplish my desired goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, I do not want this piece to turn people off of using MarketCircle’s software. I leave the unedited version below because I believe in having the intellectual integrity to own one’s mistakes. This was one of mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quickest way to make me bid your company or product farewell is to patronize me. Don’t talk down to me. Never treat me like anything but an adult. The moment you do, I am gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given which: farewell &lt;a href="https://www.marketcircle.com"&gt;MarketCircle&lt;/a&gt;, and adieu &lt;a href="https://www.marketcircle.com/billingspro/"&gt;Billings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A story: When I started working as a freelance software developer on the side a few years ago,&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I looked at my options for tracking time and invoicing clients. I eventually settled on &lt;a href="https://www.marketcircle.com/billingspro/"&gt;Billings&lt;/a&gt;, by &lt;a href="https://www.marketcircle.com"&gt;MarketCircle&lt;/a&gt;. It’s solid software: it is reliable, works well, and does everything I need it to, including tracking different clients and projects easily and sending them estimates or invoices. Best of all, from my perspective, it was a local app. You &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; sync with a server out in the cloud somewhere via Billings Pro, but you did not have to, and you could use the Mac-native application, not some web app out there. Last but not least, it had a &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; menubar app. I was sold, and I gladly dropped $40 for a single-user license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to June 2013. MarketCircle, like a lot of software development companies, came to the conclusion that it is &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; hard to develop software as a series of discrete releases, for which you get people to pay over and over again. Perfectly sensibly, they &lt;a href="https://www.marketcircle.com/blog/streamlining-the-billings-product-line/"&gt;discontinued development&lt;/a&gt; on and support for their standalone software and provided &lt;a href="https://www.marketcircle.com/billingspro/offer/"&gt;a (discounted!) migration path&lt;/a&gt; for users to upgrade to the Pro (syncing, etc.) version of the software. Note that they did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; do anything to disable functionality in existing Billings installations—just provided an upgrade path and stopped developing it. That is the right way to handle it. So far so good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a software developer, and I have seen the pressures that exist in this industry. This move made good business sense to me, and I liked Billings as a product. I was quite willing to look at their Pro plan, and possibly even to invest in it, despite the fact that I did not &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; it, because I believe in supporting the developers of the software I use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I emailed them a couple follow-up questions. One of them, and among the most important to me because of how I work for one particular client:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I note that in Billings Pro, unlike in Billings, I can’t track multiple slips simultaneously. This is problematic for me, as I often do this to keep track of hours worked against a “Personal projects” bit so I can see my hourly variations. That’s a make-or-break kind of thing for me—any chance you guys will change that behavior?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To elaborate: I like to track my total hours worked every week in a simple way, so I have a “Personal” timer going alongside the project timer for whatever I am doing. The fact that Billings let me do this was one of the selling points for me. Even so, I did not necessarily expect them to support the functionality going forward. The response I got started out reasonably enough:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We allow you to have multiple active timers, but you can only time one task at a time in both applications. In Billings, there was a bug with this, however, this was corrected in Billings Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus far, fair enough: they saw this as a bug. I disagreed, but I understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then this, though:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we all multi-task we cannot work on two billable items at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Whoops.&lt;/em&gt; You just talked down to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You also clearly didn’t read the original email, because you followed up by asking this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you explain a little more about what you track and how and I can see if there’s a different way to do this in Billings Pro that will give you the same result?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmm. Let me get this straight: I told you what I track and how I use your software, and you thought the appropriate response was to instruct me on what I can and cannot do with it? Clearly not having even read the original question carefully?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nope.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me explain: you don’t tell your customers that they can’t use your software in ways peculiar to them. You particularly do not do so as though explaining to a child that we simply cannot do certain things. If a user has a quirky way of using your software, you can of course say you don’t intend to support that quirky behavior—but you do not get to tell them that their unanticipated usage is &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt;, and especially not in a condescending tone&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cancelled my Billings Pro trial within five minutes of receiving that email. The original software I kept: I was at a busy time in the year, switching time- tracking software is non-trivial, and it wasn’t hurting me a bit to keep using the original software anyway. As I am evaluating time tracking software again, not least because I do not know through how many OS X upgrades Billings will continue to perform properly, MarketCircle isn’t on the list. It only took one bad experience to leave a bad taste in my mouth and convince me to move on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, it looks like I’m headed to &lt;a href="http://www.getharvest.com/"&gt;Harvest&lt;/a&gt;. It turns out they don’t support multiple timers, either. But they haven’t talked down to me, and that makes all the difference in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a takeaway here for anyone paying attention. Namely: respect your customers. Do not talk down to them. Do not assume their uses for your software are wrong, or stupid, even if they are not what you intended. (If anything, that means your users have thought of use cases you didn’t.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is going to far to say that the customer is always right. Sometimes, the customer is wrong. Sometimes, &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; am wrong as a customer. But the customer &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; always someone to respect. The moment you stop treating your customer with respect is the moment you cross the line into being a company with which I want to do business to one I will avoid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="edit-and-addendum" class="level6"&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Edit and Addendum&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I posted this on App.net, a few thoughtful acquaintances &lt;a href="https://alpha.app.net/chriskrycho/post/34459957"&gt;pushed back&lt;/a&gt;, noting that the customer service interactions did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; read as condescending to them. It is possible that I misread the original customer service rep’s tone in interacting in me. This is a constant danger in dealing with text-only communication. I take some responsibility for that—but I also note that the frustration had already built up in the course of a conversation that had already included a number of failures to respond to address or respond to my questions and concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should also note that I didn’t mean this as a critique of MarketCircle in particular, though re-reading the post in light of the response, it is clear it comes off more that way than I intended. My interactions with MarketCircle were meant simply to illustrate the broader point: customer service matters, and even one bad customer experience can turn off a customer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the takeaway from this addendum is a bit different: I can sympathize with the difficulties facing the customer service rep. I failed at precisely the same task of communicating my intent in writing effectively. Now, whether that rep meant it the way I took it or the way others took it in reading the post, he certainly did not accomplish what he meant to with the exchange. My sympathies are with him. I am perfectly willing (though not perhaps &lt;em&gt;happy&lt;/em&gt;; humility is rarely particularly pleasant) to say that I got it wrong here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that being said… I still have a bad taste in my mouth, and I am still leery of doing further business with MarketCircle. And that &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; make the original point in a way, because the emotional response from a bad experience, even one you did not intend, doesn’t fade quickly or at all, even in the face of reasonable articulations of alternative explanations for the bad experience. You have to work at a good customer experience continually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="further-addendum" class="level6"&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Further Addendum&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MarketCircle actually saw this piece—presumably via my link on Twitter—and got back to me, looking to fix this issue, which I really appreciated. In some sense, then, they &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; doing exactly what I advocated in this piece.&lt;/p&gt;

Strange though it might seem, the thought hadn’t occurred to me. I like getting the notice of things having happened on my social media accounts, but I’d concluded recently that I actively disliked having the interruption even of a buzz in my pocket: it forces a mental context shift which inevitably degrades my concentration on whatever task I am about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent ten minutes this evening and went through my iPhone’s notification settings. The only things which have audible or vibrating notifications now are phone calls (including FaceTime) and text messages. Everything else I disabled. Now, I still have notifications on a number of other items: they can show up in Notification Center, and they can put markers on the home screen apps. After all: if I already have my phone out, it is almost certainly no problem to see a notification come in, and I definitely want to be able to glance at the app on my home screen and see that someone has interacted with me in some way. But when I &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; have my phone out? It is unhelpful. It is distracting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually turned on app badges for a number of apps for which I had previously disabled them, because they had been extraneous when I was getting noises or buzzes for the apps and services in question. I also tweaked a number of other apps: some can show app badges but not appear in notification center. Most cannot show anything on the lock screen at all. If I want to check on notifications, I can look explicitly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will see how the experiment goes. Even just a few hours in, though, I can already say I like it. I did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; get any buzzing in my pocket when a few people interacted with me on App.net, or Instagram, or anywhere else. And, social media being what it is, none of those interactions are temporally important (however much it might feel otherwise). They will still be there waiting when I get back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, this does not automatically make me more productive. I still need self control to be most effective in using my time. It does take away a few of the most obvious distractions and interruptions that make it hard to focus, though, and that is &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; a win.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s generally interesting to me in part because I’ve worked on a related project in the past, and we talked fairly often about how the LRS-B program might impact it. The article is worth your time. This quote from Robert Gates in the middle of the article, which touches on the program the LRS-B would replace, caught my attention, though:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we must not do is repeat what happened with our last manned bomber. By the time the research, development, and requirements processes ran their course, the aircraft, despite its great capability, turned out to be so expensive—$2 billion each in the case of the B-2—that less than one-sixth of the planned fleet of 132 was ever built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, it makes little sense to pursue a future bomber—a prospective B-3, if you will—in a way that repeats this history. We must avoid a situation in which the loss of even one aircraft—by accident, or in combat—results in a loss of a significant portion of the fleet, a national disaster akin to the sinking of a capital ship. This scenario raises our costs of action and shrinks our strategic options, when we should be looking to the kind of weapons systems that limit the costs of action and expand our options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, in one sense, Gates was absolutely right. On the other hand, he seems to have committed a classic blunder in dealing with these kinds of costs: economies of scale matter. Part of the reason the per-unit price of the B-2 was so high was precisely that we only bought 20 of them. While the units were individually expensive to manufacture and maintain, because of unique materials used in their construction and so on, they were much &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; expensive to manufacture in small numbers than they would have been in large numbers. There are basically two reasons for this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The manufacturing process couldn’t do what it does best (turn out large numbers of standardized parts and thereby reduce costs).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The costs of development—research, software development, etc.—were all distributed over a much smaller pool than they would have been had the government purchased more aircraft.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This second point is incredibly important to understand. It is certainly true that the absolute cost of buying 132 B-2s would have been high, possibly astronomically and unaffordably high. What it would &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; have been is $264 billion. Even assuming that manufacture costs were fully half of the cost-per- plane (almost certainly not the case), it would have been barely over half that. Assume that the B-2 cost $1B per plane to build, and that the other $10B was research. Well, that’s still an expensive plan… but the total cost is something like $144B, not $264B. Those economies of scale matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This same reality is a point made later in the article by another commentator, but I couldn’t let it go. Things like this drive me nuts, because they’re such a common failing in our political discourse. Ignorance of basic economics from the people making decisions with this kind of economic impact is profoundly unhelpful.&lt;/p&gt;

I always have been. I sat down a few weeks ago to write up an explanation of my running approach, and I haven’t finished it yet… because it is over 2,500 words long and growing rapidly longer. But as I have considered my approach to blogging of late, and as I have also been posting fairly regularly on App.net (my social media locale of choice), it occurred to me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blog posts do not have to be the lengthy things I usually make of them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I often write up a series of thoughts—not necessarily an “argument” or indeed anything more than a series of connected thoughts—on App.net, connecting them via the ‘reply’ mechanism and enumerating them. Rather like I am here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doing so inevitably clutters up the streams of anyone following me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That clutter may or may not be problematic: some folks may enjoy those connected thoughts. Others may not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For those that &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; enjoy those connected thoughts, a blog post like this would probably serve just as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For those who do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; enjoy them… well, this sort of thing would be a welcome way to clear their streams up without causing me any particular difficulty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using lists does not automatically mean I have given in to the constant temptation to make my blogging about driving views.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seriously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This blog will &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; drive substantial amounts of traffic. That is fine by me. Indeed, I would probably feel a bit odd if it did.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Therefore, when I have those sorts of thoughts-in-a-line in the future, I will do as I have done here. I will write a ‘listicle’ (the shame!) and share it for others to partake of—or not!—as they please.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taking that approach will almost certainly free me up to blog more briefly when I feel like it, as well. That, too, can only be a good thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After all: I am happier when I am writing.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div id="refs" class="references"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;section class="footnotes"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I have so often &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/the-long-race.html"&gt;noted before&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;a href="#fnref1"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, pastors want to demonstrate their gratitude toward those who have served their country well – heroes who put themselves in harm’s way for the good of their neighbors. They are patriotic citizens who love their country and don’t want to be seen as contributing to cynicism or apathy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, pastors express reservations about incorporating patriotic songs and anthems into a worship service. They worry that too many people are already confused about the relationship between Christianity and the culture, the church and the country, and that such services exacerbate the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He suggested four basic reasons for this discomfort and confusion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extreme Experiences in the Past&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decreasing Patriotism Among Millennials&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shifting Cultural Currents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Failure to Fully Appreciate Time and Place&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His analysis of the overall situation was fairly helpful, and I recommend you read it. However, in his final point, he argued:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some younger evangelicals see any patriotic expression as a compromise with worldly power. Their approach is to take the flag out of the sanctuary, never sing a patriotic song, and never mention a patriotic holiday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this overreaction has unfortunate and unintended repercussions. It lends itself to a Gnostic idea that downplays our embodied state (as humans) within a state (a nation). We are rooted in time and place, and this is according to God’s good plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I think Wax gets this wrong, and younger evangelicals get it basically right, at least &lt;em&gt;in the context of the church&lt;/em&gt;. It is one thing to say that when younger evangelicals reject any sense of patriotism at all, that is an unhealthy and unhelpful move. If Wax had stopped there, I would have agreed with him. We do undervalue our embodied context and we do need a greater sense of the goodness of our geographical and temporal contexts in God’s providence. We certainly should be grateful the blessings of liberty that we enjoy, and I think as Americans we ought to celebrate those things. Independence Day (and other similar holidays such as Memorial Day and Veterans Day) are parts of our culture in which we as Christians ought to participate. We should participate in a chastened way, perhaps, recognizing the mixed legacy of our nation’s history, but we should participate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we should not participate &lt;em&gt;when we act as the church&lt;/em&gt;. On Sunday morning, we should never be singing the Star Spangled Banner, because we gather precisely to proclaim our allegiance to a king and our citizenship to a kingdom that transcends national borders just as it transcends ethnicity and culture. It does not &lt;em&gt;blur out&lt;/em&gt; those differences, but it does not set that as ultimate or allow allegiance to them. We can see that an anthem to Asian or Caucasian or Black ethnicity would be inappropriate in the church (even as we affirm the goodness of Asian, Caucasian, Black, and other ethnicities and cultures). Singing patriotic songs in the church or preaching a sermon on American history is no less inappropriate. It divides precisely where the gospel calls us to unity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is ultimately about a confusion of spheres. The church is the place where the kingdom of God has broken into the present age. The nation-state is the place where his reign has not yet been established. Confusing the two does no one any good. We long for the day when every nation &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; part of the kingdom of heaven, but if we blur out the distinctions between the two &lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt;, we will produce confusion and unhealthy attitudes toward on or the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To take one obvious example: Wax notes that younger evangelicals seem uncomfortable with God-and-country language—and younger evangelicals are &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; to be uncomfortable with such language. Whenever we have conflated the work of God in the spread of the gospel to America, we have ended up in all sorts of confusion. We end up political servants to one party or the other, making all sorts of un-Christian ethical compromises along the way. We end up affirming approaches to foreign and domestic policy that bear little resemblance to the ethic of Christ we are taught by the apostles. To pick just one specific-but-controversial example: we find it hard to remember that we have more in common with our Palestinian brothers and sisters in Christ than with our non-Christian Israeli friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should never hang an American flag in our churches. We should never sing the national anthem in our churches. We should never leave any doubt when we gather together that we come as one people, joined in Christ across every line that exists in this world: ethnic, cultural, linguistic, geographical, political, temporal. We should never, ever confuse our joyful embrace of our being situated in this place and time with our ultimate allegiance to a kingdom still to come. We should skip the patriotic services and take the opportunity instead to remind people both that every blessing we have in this nation is from God &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; that this nation is but one of many lands of sojourn for his people. We should teach each other to be glad that this is our land, but to look with all the more longing toward our future home when all nations will bring their treasures into the New Jerusalem. We should &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEiXrRmtDIk&amp;amp;feature=kp" title="Land of My Sojourn"&gt;with Rich Mullins&lt;/a&gt; say that we will call this our country and be longing for our home.&lt;/p&gt;

It is easy to let it drop off in the midst of all the busyness of the end of a semester, and easy, too, in the midst of caring for a new baby and a recovering wife simply not to find the time for it. But my soul needs to encounter the living God day by day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today’s reading was not exactly scintillating in many ways: reading in Chronicles rarely is. But as I have often reflected in the past several years, Paul had in mind the Old Testament—books like this and Numbers and Leviticus, those we find hardest!—when he told us that &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for us (2 Tim. 3:16). That is no less true of Chronicles’ recounting of the deeds of David’s mighty men or the assembly of Israel to anoint him king than it is of the gospel accounts of Jesus’ life and death. We need all of these pieces to fully understand the work of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few points I take away from my reading this morning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="god-is-holy." class="level4"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;God is holy.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two accounts that make this abundantly clear in the section I read today: the death of Uzzah, the judgment on David for his sin with the census. In the case of Uzzah, God brooked no deviation from his clearly articulated correct way for the transportation of the Ark of the Covenant. That Uzzah meant well did not change the reality that he (and indeed all of David’s initial foray to bring the Ark to Jerusalem) had ignored what God had said. Ignoring God’s word is no light matter. We sometimes blanch at the severity of this judgment, but to ignore when God speaks is to make light of his speech—to insult him and quietly rebel in precisely the same way our first parents did in the Garden. It is to say our own wisdom is sufficient when he has expressly given us &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second case, God’s judgment for David’s census, is interesting in that the text does not expressly tell us what David’s sin was, yet it is obvious that he did sin and in such a way as to anger God profoundly. Joab, who was instructed to carry out the census, clearly understood that it was wrong; so did David. Given the backdrop of the regulations of censuses in the Pentateuch, it seems that David was going about it for the wrong reasons, and without following the pattern God had laid out.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Yet David went ahead anyway. God responded in judgment. Again: it came down to a simple refusal to do as God had instructed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These two accounts remind me that I must obey God. It is as plain and simple as that—whatever the circumstances, whatever apparent justification I might muster for doing otherwise, I need to obey. God is holy; he does not brook unrighteousness. Yes, he has atoned for my unrighteousness, but this was true of David as well (see below). I am still called to live in obedience to him, and insofar as I lead, I am responsible to lead others to do so as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="god-is-merciful." class="level4"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;God is merciful.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This second passage of judgment also highlights God’s mercy. Yahweh sent the angel to bring destruction on the people for David’s sin, but Yahweh &lt;em&gt;relented&lt;/em&gt;, too—and this before David did anything at all. Sometimes we can make the mistake in reading the Old Testament of thinking that Yahweh had always to be appeased &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; he would turn back from his righteous judgments, but the reality is the opposite. The vast majority of the time, Yahweh relented simply because of his forbearance and mercy and patience. Many times when the people clearly had not yet relented, the pleas of one righteous person on their behalf led him to stay his hand. Other times, like here, he stayed his judgment without &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; standing in that position—simply because he is merciful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was this reality with whicih Paul wrestled “out loud,” so to speak, in Romans: how can a just God overlook sins? How can he just pass over and &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; execute judgment when judgment is so clearly deserved?&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The answer for Paul was not to make less of the sin God passed over, but to make that much more of Christ. The Old Testament believers like David were saved by the death and resurrection of Christ just as we are. We are called to faith and trust in the one who has made it possible for the righteousness of God to be cause for our &lt;em&gt;hope&lt;/em&gt; rather than despair. And here is the flipside of the call to obey God’s word inherent in those earlier passages: the call to &lt;em&gt;trust&lt;/em&gt; God as he has spoken to us. This is good news, if we will but believe it and cling to it.&lt;/p&gt;

The issue is not so much whether I spend my time well, but where I spend it. I will go on a blogging kick for a few months, as I did at the beginning of this year, then not write much at all for a few months—but in the interval spend gobs of time reading, or writing software, or so on. I am not sure what it is that triggers the change, but it has been a fairly regular fixture of my life for at least the length of our marriage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every once in a while, I will even go on a weeks-long video games or television kick. This is bliss for Jaimie, as she finds spending time together playing video games or watching television shows we both enjoy to be one of our best connecting activities. But then the spell comes to an end, and I’m back off to a reading kick, or designing a new website, or embarking on some crazed software development scheme or another. It somewhat drives Jaimie crazy, I suspect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not entirely sure what makes me tick this way. I do know that in those dedicated phases of work I can knock out significant tasks in the given area where I am motivated at any given time. (I have no doubt, for example, that I could pull off the 50,000 words needed for National Novel Writing Month some November, if I were in a writing mode.) Being able to predict these things would be nice, though. I could make a plan for the year and have a good idea what projects I would accomplish. Instead, I find myself extraordinarily productive in &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; area at any given time—but never sure what it will be a month later. That’s not a &lt;em&gt;problem&lt;/em&gt;. It is, however, a bit perplexing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be sure, I can and do force myself to continue on with certain tasks even when they are not particularly holding my interest. Sometimes that discipline is really helpful, and I eventually break through to another extended session of productivity in the same area. Sometimes, though, the interval—whether it is switching from writing to software and back again, or from software to Doctor Who and back again—brings me back fresher and more energized to complete the tasks. That is no surprise; I see the same patterns play out on the time scale of hours and days with my paid work (where just taking a month off is not particularly workable). Again: I just wish I could get a handle on the timing, so I could take advantage of that in making plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, I seem to be in a video games and general blogging mode. I &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to dig back in on my software projects, and I expect I’ll do so soon. And by “soon” I mean: whenever I quit playing more &lt;em&gt;Skyrim&lt;/em&gt;. Probably in about two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, I think I’m going to start tracking the particular moods I am in so that I can see if there is an established pattern throughout the year. Whether it correlates with the season, my other activities, or nothing at all would be helpful to know. For Jaimie’s sanity, if nothing else.&lt;/p&gt;

</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chris Krycho</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 27 May 2014 20:45:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:www.chriskrycho.com,2014-05-27:2014/three-month-cycles.html</guid></item><item><title>The Long Race</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/the-long-race.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;It has been too long since I have written anything—too long not for my audience (small as it is), but for my soul. The last few weeks of class were of course even busier than the rest of the semester, courtesy of a couple major assignments I wrapped up and studying for and taking finals, all while doing my normal work as a software developer on the side. Writing simply fell by the wayside, alas. Even my devotions posts simply didn’t happen. And that is all right; there are seasons for all of these things, and it is not as if I didn’t write many thousands of words in late April and early May. They simply were not &lt;em&gt;blogging&lt;/em&gt; words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here I am tonight, writing simply to unwind. I spent much of the day working on various software projects—a pattern I expect to carry throughout the summer. In addition to my regular work for Quest Consultants Inc. back in Norman, I am picking up various web design and development jobs over the summer. God has been gracious in answering prayers for opportunities to pick up extra contracting work, and I have several really excellent opportunities to supplement my 20 hours a week for Quest with other work. That is nice not only financially, but also intellectually. The change of pace between different kinds of work helps me stay fresh on all of them. My own personal &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/a-little-crazy.html"&gt;side projects&lt;/a&gt; are coming along slowly, but that is all right. Slow but steady is the best way to go about those kinds of projects anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That lesson is one I have learned more and more from my ongoing and ever-increasing delight in running. So far in May I have run about 125 miles; I expect to run over 150 miles this month in total (though of course all such plans are always subject to revision, and never more so than when one’s wife is 37 weeks pregnant). I am now running easy, aerobic miles ten to fifteen seconds faster per mile than I could manage in my personal best half marathon time a few years ago. I run so (relatively) quickly now not because of any particular innate athleticism—quite the contrary, as anyone who has known me since high school can attest. I can run as far and fast as I do only because I have stuck with it and used a &lt;a href="http://markallenonline.com/maoArticles.aspx?AID=2" title="Working Your Heart"&gt;smart training plan&lt;/a&gt;. And really, as in most parts of life, it is that sticking-with-it that leads to getting somewhere. Of course, sticking with it is no guarantee that things will work out. It is usually a requisite step along the way, though—a necessary-though-insufficient condition. That is simply the way God built the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little Ellie is quickly wrapping up her second year of life in this big world. She is saying lots of words (at last!), whining until she has driven Jaimie a bit crazy (in too-typical toddler fashion), and growing up in big ways and small. We are having a great deal of fun watching her start to be more socially aware and active, even if it is a little strange to have a daughter old enough that she has friends whom she loves and who love her in turn. She has also discovered a deep love of &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;—no surprise for a daughter of ours, though the intensity of her delight in the movies, for a girl who is not yet two years old, did surprise both Jaimie and me a bit. You should hear her try to say “Darth Vader” or “Dark Side” or “Star Wars.” It is impossibly adorable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jaimie is, as noted above, some 37 weeks pregnant and quite ready to be done carrying our second little gal on the inside. She is still plugging away slowly at the &lt;a href="http://jaimiekrycho.com/shaking-epheria-pt-1/" title="Bloodlines: The Shaking of Epheria, Part I"&gt;second novella&lt;/a&gt; in her &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bloodlines-Epheria-The-Trilogy-ebook/dp/B00HY478QO/" title="Get Bloodlines of Epheria on Kindle!"&gt;Bloodlines&lt;/a&gt; fantasy trilogy. She manages to keep Ellie entertained—no small feat—and does a remarkable job taking care of things around the house so that I can focus on work and school. Her struggle with &lt;a href="http://2012-2013.chriskrycho.com/theology/marriage-depression/" title="Marriage and Depression"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; has not diminished, but God has given us grace to carry on and she and I have both learned to respond in better, healthier, more helpful ways when the slumps come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the future, we really have no idea what the next several yeras will hold. I plan to finish my Master of Divinity—Lord willing, around December 2016. In the meantime, we will keep raising our little girls, I will keep writing software, and we will keep exploring and seeing what we want to do and how best to pursue those desires in a way that honors God. Who knows what those years will hold? God only, and certainly not us.&lt;/p&gt;

Drawing an analogy from music purchases that have moved in the same direction, he suggests that publishers &lt;em&gt;ought&lt;/em&gt; to be bundling, and then poses the query: When you purchase a print book you should be able to get the e-book for…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the full combined retail prices of print and e-book editions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an additional 50% of the retail price of the print edition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an additional 25% of the retail price of the print edition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$1.00 more than the retail price of the print edition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;free&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He suggests that this proves to be something of a conundrum for decision-makers in the publishing industry. With respect, and while recognizing that it probably &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; like a conundrum to the publishers, I think the answer is really quite simple. Publishers can dramatically increase their profits, and do it in a way that readers will &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt;. (This is the part where you call me crazy. Up next is the part where I show you why I’m not.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="all-or-nothing" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;All or nothing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we should note that while readers would always choose (e) and publishers would love it if they could get away with (a), the reality is that both of these leave one party out in the cold. Publishers need readers, and readers need publishers. Publishers need readers or they die. Readers need publishers as providers of quality content—not only as the gatekeepers but also as polishers who take good books and make them great. Any system that will pan out well must therefore respect &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; sides of that equation. Both (a) and (e) fail that test immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of (a), the consumer can rightly point out that the cost of distribution of a book is minimal, trivial even, in the grand scheme of book production. That goes double for ebooks: the cost of running a server is a pittance compared to the cost of writing, editing, and proofing a book. “So,” any smart reader says, “I’ve already paid for the book. Why should I have to pay &lt;em&gt;just as much again&lt;/em&gt; for the ebook?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of (e), the consumer is getting something of real value—the ebook, with its associated portability, the ability to create [communal interactions][craigmod] around the content through shared marginalia, and so forth—but without recognizing any infrastructure costs this poses to the publisher. As always, there is no free lunch, and that is as it should be.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The worker deserves his wages, and that includes the editor who turns a manuscript into ebook form—especially for &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; ebooks, which entail a great deal of work beyond simply running the print manuscript through a conversion script. That involves real people’s time, and therefore costs real money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither of these options, then, is ultimately good for the market. The readers will rightly reject paying the full price again for a book in a different form; they’ve been conditioned by too many interactions on the internet not to recognize that digital transmission of files the size of a book is, while not costless, not costly either. On the other hand, publishers still need to make money, and they do sink real time and money into the ebook—not at the distribution point, but in the infrastructure involved in the preparation of the manuscript and readying it for digital and physical publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again: publishers need readers and readers need publishers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="percentage-games" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Percentage games&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Percentage-based cuts—like Curtis’ options (b) and (c)—are much more sensible and reasonable from the perspective of both the consumer and the publisher. In each of these cases, the publisher is granting that the customer has already made a purchase—perhaps a significant one, in the case of a hardcover fiction book. Indeed, when we move out into the realm of reference books or textbooks, the consumer has already given the publisher quite a lot of money. Thus, options (b) and (c) are much friendlier to the consumer than choice (a), while still affording the publisher some profits, unlike (e). This is clearly a step in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The percentage option quickly runs into issues when we start thinking about how such a scheme would work in practice, though. Is it 25% of the hardcover but 50% of the paperback, so that the publisher can recoup more of the costs? In this scheme, it is difficult to match the actual cost of the ebook sale to its relative value compared to the physical copy. Moreover, it’s difficult to standardize. When purchasing a textbook at $150, should someone have to pay another $37.50 or $75 to have a digital copy? It seems unlikely that preparing an ebook of a textbook is really 5-6 times more costly than the preparation of a fiction ebook, which on a percentage basis would come out around $6.50 or $13 for the hardcover at those rates, or $2 or $4 for paperbacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equally important: &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; people pay that much for a digital copy? Publishers may want to study the question in depth by testing the market, but this is a waste of time. The answer is obvious to anyone under the age of 30: &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt;. The market simply won’t support those kinds of costs on the upper end of the spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, customers may recognize that they are subsidizing more than simply the cost of distribution, but the preparation and distribution of the ebook don’t justify an additional percentage on these scales beyond some point. I suspect that most customers are willing to pay extra to get the ebook in addition to the physical copy—just not, in most cases, &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; much extra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="aside-on-reasonability-and-trained-markets" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Aside: on reasonability and trained markets&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must recognize that markets can be &lt;em&gt;trained&lt;/em&gt;. People have come to see $0.99 as a reasonable price for individual songs. There was nothing inevitable about that outcome; it is a direct result of the success of the iTunes store. Had prices been set at $1.49 or $0.33, it’s likely we would have settled on that number as a reasonable price. Similarly, TV show episodes sell at $1.99,&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and people seem to treat that as a reasonable price: the perceived value matches the cost well. They could have been $1 or $2.50, and consumers probably would have settled in with those numbers equally well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, had the price been too high, we would have rejected it entirely: markets can be trained, but they’re not capable of stretching into just any shape at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, the music market remains volatile, but consumers on the whole don’t seem to balk at spending a dollar on a song. While the piracy rate remains high, iTunes and similar markets provide an outlet for those who are interested in purchasing their music legitimately.&lt;a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This outcome results from the combination of a trained market and a sensible cost/value relationship that allowed the training to occur in the first place. Book publishers should aim for the same outcome: profitability on the basis of perceived reasonability of their prices. This will require training the market, but that is possible so long as their expectations are reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="a-reasonable-target" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A reasonable target&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;section id="price-points" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Price points&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curtis’ final suggested price point is close to the mark, but I think some revision is in order. Remember: the aim is to buoy both customer satisfaction &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; publisher profitability. Here’s my proposed pricing scheme for fiction (which could be adapted to other parts of the market fairly straightforwardly):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Standalone ebook: $4.99&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paperback:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Book: $7.99&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bundle: $9.99&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trade paperback:&lt;a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Book: $14.99&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bundle: $15.99&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hardcover:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Book: $26.99&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bundle: $26.99&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m basing these on the current pricing schemes in the market—these are the normal suggested retail prices for paperbacks, trade paperbacks, and hard covers—and on the assumption that the publisher’s goal is to maximize revenue, while the consumer’s goal is to get the most content at a price he feels is reasonable. I’m also taking into account the existing profit curves for publishers: paperbooks are relatively low margin, while hardcovers are the major profit points, at least when they’re successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="rationale" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Rationale&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, and most importantly, I believe the market will support these price points. The standalone ebook is less expensive than the paperback, as it should be, since its distribution costs are much lower than the costs of printing and shipping paperbacks. At the same time, ebooks sales will still generate revenue for the publisher; $5 is not a meaningless amount of money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each tier upwards, the cost of the bundled ebook drops. The publisher thus acknowledges the increasing profitability of each tier as well as the increasing cost to the reader. At the same time, the lowered bundling cost incentivizes the user toward the higher profit items. In each case, the bundling cost is sufficiently low as to be in the “impulse purchase” range for most users.&lt;a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Readers will be far more likely to front the cost of a hardcover if an ebook comes bundled with it, because the value proposition is so much better. At the same time, this is unlikely to decrease the profits of the publisher, because the margins are much higher for hardcovers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, bundling at these rates will likely increase publisher profits from ebooks, as most readers currently choose between ebook and physical books. The price of a hardcover is simply too high to allow for the purchase of both. (Even when this is not actually true, it &lt;em&gt;seems&lt;/em&gt; true to consumers, which is equally important in determining their behavior.) With a sufficiently lower barrier to getting the additional content, the likelihood that the reader purchases both goes up substantially.&lt;a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This potential for increased profitability is compounded by the availability of the bundle at initial purchase time. A consumer who has already committed to spending $8 on a book is unlikely to balk at $10, and even less to balk at the transition from $15 to $16. In many cases, the publisher will earn more money from the book purchase than before, but the reader is still getting a good deal on the ebook. This is &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; the combination that makes for a flourishing market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the simplicity of these numbers is extremely helpful. Standardizing these prices will decrease the friction inherent in making the purchase decision, which increases the likelihood that a purchase will be made. I’m not suggesting a cartel—price standardization is natural in this sort of market—and I believe the price points I’ve suggested are where the market will settle in the long run. The publishers who get there first will earn enormous goodwill from their readers in the short term, as well as demonstrating their leadership in the industry in ways that set them up for long term success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="bundle-up" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bundle up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A smart approach to bundling could be enormously beneficial to the publishing industry. In addition to the pure numerical profitability of the approach outlined above—no small detail in an industry struggling to adapt to the realities of the new economy—it establishes that the publishers are responsive to customers in a way that other large media have not seemed to be. Nothing is so helpful to a company’s long-term sustainability as for consumers to &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; it. Reasonable bundling prices would go a long way toward helping readers see publishers as friends, rather than enemies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously these numbers work best in the context of fiction. The value propositions are entirely different in other contexts; a cookbook is an entirely different thing than a copy of &lt;em&gt;The Hobbit&lt;/em&gt;. Across the board, though, publishers should keep the same goals in mind: profitability by means of reasonability and approachability. Be allies of the readers, not their enemies. Make it easy and affordable for them to pay you for your work, and they will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section class="footnotes"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, there is a signaling problem here: “free” suggests “low value” in a way that publishers rightly want to avoid. See &lt;a href="http://informationarchitects.net/blog/ia-writer-on-prices-and-features/"&gt;“iA Writer: On Prices and Features”&lt;/a&gt;, Section 2: Cost, by Oliver Richtenstein for a lengthy and sensible exploration of this issue. The issue of signaling value should be taken into account in my suggestions later, as well. But more on that below.&lt;a href="#fnref1"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When they sell at all, of course. I’ve written about this problem [before][piracy]: piracy explodes when there is demand without supply. It also tends to grow at a higher rate when the cost is perceived as unreasonable. TV shows priced at $5/episode wouldn’t do well; they seem to sell quite briskly at $1.99. Publishers run the risk of fomenting piracy by setting their prices too high.&lt;a href="#fnref2"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn3"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have never seen someone complain that a song is too expensive at a dollar who was willing to pay &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt;. A penny would be too pricey from the pirates’ point of view.&lt;a href="#fnref3"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn4"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trade paperbacks (TPBs) are similar in size to hardcovers, but have soft covers similar to those in a paperback. Fiction TPBs typically go for around $15. Over the last few years, publishers have started shifting away from the low-margin paperback market into these trade paperbacks, which provide a bit higher profit for them. Personally, I don’t mind, because these books tend to be higher quality paper and bindings. If I’m sitting down with a monster like one of the books in &lt;cite&gt;The Wheel of Time&lt;/cite&gt;, this is far and away the best format for a physical copy.&lt;a href="#fnref4"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the signaling issue: the price of the ebook is sufficiently high as to continue to signal real value here, I think. However, in the case of other kinds of books, this scheme should be revisited. A complex EPUB3 with embedded videos or interactive content should signal that it offers a higher value proposition than other ebooks with a higher price point; in some cases, if that content is sufficiently central to the value proposition of the book, it might be more expensive than the physical copies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, a textbook might sell for $150, its ebook at $50, and the bundle at $165—because the cost of preparing a textbook ebook may be substantially higher than that of preparing a fiction ebook. Signaling matters, but overpricing is as much a risk here as underpricing.&lt;a href="#fnref5"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has the added benefit of making the purchase of new books over used books more attractive to the consumer: if the coupon for ebook at reduced rate is only available at new book purchase, a $3 used book suddenly has a much lower value proposition relative to the original when the reader is interested in having an ebook copy as well, since the cost of having both is still $8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this leads us to the question of ebook resale, which is currently a legally murky area at best, and requires considerable legal and intellectual development.&lt;a href="#fnref6"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

In this reading, the New Covenant is specific to the work of Christ in the New Testament age, and was never experienced by any “Old Testament believers”. Those believers remained under the previous (Abrahamic and especially Mosaic and Davidic) covenants, while New Testament believers are New Covenant believers. For this view, they draw on the ways that the New Covenant language was picked up by the authors of the New Testament, especially in Hebrews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though this reading has an ancient pedigree, going back at least as far as Jerome, it is ultimately incorrect. First, it fails to take the content of Jeremiah’s vision on its own terms. As Jeremiah traces out his vision of the New Covenant in chapters 31–33, he explicitly includes the language of law-keeping, temple working and priests, and a Davidic king over the land of Israel. These were not merely symbolic expectations, but fully fleshed out hopes for and visions of a restoration of the covenant God made with Israel at Sinai. Indeed, the terms of priestly temple sacrifice and law-keeping used throughout the section presuppose the covenant language of Deuteronomy and the discussion in Deuteronomy 30 of the circumcised heart. Thus, Hill and Walton note (and likewise Thomas suggested) that in many ways it is more appropriate to speak of a &lt;em&gt;renewed&lt;/em&gt; covenant than of a totally &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; covenant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the reading of the ‘New Covenant’ as &lt;em&gt;wholly&lt;/em&gt; new misses the ways the other authors of the Old Testament responded to this promise. In particular, Ezra’s prayer in Ezra-Nehemiah makes it abundantly clear that he considered the people’s return to the land after their 70-year-exile a fulfillment of the prophecy. If it was not a complete fulfillment—as indeed that same prayer acknowledges, for the people’s hearts were still wayward—it nonetheless represented at least a partial fulfillment. There were once again Jewish people living in the land, performing temple sacrifice and following Yahweh. Though the Davidic king had not yet been reinstated, and though the people’s hearts had not yet had the law so thoroughly stamped on them that they no longer needed teachers, the promise was partly fulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, even in the age after Christ’s coming it is clear that the vision remains only fulfilled in part. True: there was a significant break in the shape of history in the incarnation, life, death, resurrection, and ascension of the Son. Yet God’s law is not yet written so thoroughly on anyone’s heart that no man needs to teach his neighbor. Christians still wrestle with sin. Moreover, as the author of Hebrews notes, this Davidic king who fulfills the New Covenant hopes has not yet put everything in subjection under his feet (Heb. 2). He is seated at the right hand of God, exalted above the heavens, and has inaugurated his reign, but he has not yet &lt;em&gt;consummated&lt;/em&gt; reign. The same author who affirms so strongly that Jesus is the fulfillment of the New Covenant hope affirms as well that the New Covenant is not yet fully completed. The ancient Jews lived in an “already but not yet” after the return from Exile. In the work of Christ, that “already” is significantly advanced—but the “not yet” remains until he returns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that there is &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; new about the New Covenant. Unlike in Deuteronomy 30, where the people were enjoined to repent and circumcise their own hearts, the work in Jeremiah’s vision is wholly God’s. Too, the New Testament’s embrace of New Covenant language in terms of Jesus’ work means that Christians &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; understand that something new has happened in Christ. Specifically, Christ has done what Israel could not. Jesus kept the law perfectly, needing no one to teach him; he served as both priest and sacrifice to make atonement for the sins of the people; he rules and judges righteously as the Davidic Branch who represents Yahweh; he even reconstituted Israel in his twelve disciples. Jesus Messiah &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the fulfillment of the New Covenant. He is the hope toward which the Old Testament saints looked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Augustine, not Jerome, had the right of it. All the Old Testament saints were participants in the New Covenant. They looked forward to that which they did not see, but they too were saved by faith in Christ. They did not have the full revelation with which New Testament saints are blessed. They saw from far off that of which Christians now enjoy the fullness. But Jesus’ work in bringing about the New Covenant was not something foreign to the covenants that had gone before; it was the fulfillment of all of them. Here was the offspring of the woman who would crush the serpent’s head, the offspring of Abraham in whom all nations would be blessed, the prophet like Moses who would give the law anew, the true Israel who would keep the law rightly, the offspring of David who would do justice for his people and for the nations. Jeremiah’s New Covenant promised the fulfillment of what had gone before. It was new in that Jesus finally accomplished what no Israelite ever had. It was the renewal of the old in that what Jesus accomplished was precisely the hope set before Israel from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;I. The Centrality and Uniqueness of the Incarnation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Incarnation of the Son of God is the ground of all Christian hope. It is the “central miracle asserted by Christians.”&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Without the Incarnation, there would be no salvation. Not only would the other aspects of redemption (Christ’s life, teaching, death on the cross, resurrection, and ascension) not be possible, but parts of the restoration of humanity hinge on the Incarnation itself. The Incarnation was a unique event in history, with unique theological significance. At no other time has God manifested himself as a human being. The Spirit’s present indwelling of all believers is a direct result of and carries forward the reconciliation of divinity and humanity that occured in the person of Jesus Christ. A healthy church depends on a healthy Christology, for it is only in Christ and by Christ’s Spirit that the church exists—and there can be no healthy Christology without a robust doctrine of the Incarnation. It is in the Incarnation that Jesus the Messiah must be understood: a single person uniting all that it is to be God and all that it is to be human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="a.-biblical-affirmations" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A. Biblical Affirmations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of the Gospels opens in a way that emphasizes the unique nature of Jesus Christ. Matthew begins with a genealogy that situates him in the story of Israel, then immediately shows in narrative that from his conception he was also divine (Matt. 1–2, esp. 1:1, 1:23). Mark, ever brief, introduces the Messiah with the astounding words, “Jesus Christ, the Son of God” (Mark 1:1).&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Luke inverts Matthew’s order: miraculous birth first, genealogy second. He situations Jesus not only in Israel’s story but in humanity’s, tracing his lineage to Adam (Luke 1:26–28, 2:8–38, 3:23–38). John reaches out to Greek philosophy and turns it on its head, proclaiming the coming of the uncreated &lt;em&gt;logos&lt;/em&gt; into creation (John 1:1–18). The sum effect of the gospel-tellers is to emphasize that in Jesus Christ, something profoundly unique had happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps nowhere are the importance and uniqueness of the Incarnation more evident than in the Epistle to the Hebrews. The anonymous letter emphasizes from its first words the uniqueness of Jesus’ incarnation and ministry (Heb. 1:1–2). It argues that the Incarnation was essential to his roles as priest (2:17–18, 4:15, 5:5–10, 7:26–8:2), destroyer of death (2:14–15), and propitiatory sacrifice (2:9, 7:27, 9:11–28, 10:12–14, 10:19–22). It is not only that Jesus died to save people from their sins, but that he became human and lived to that end and more besides—a consistent theme throughout the New Testament. Thus, Zechariah’s prophecy (Luke 1:76–79) includes salvation from sin, but also light coming into the world, death’s power coming to an end, and peace reigning in the cosmos. Likewise, John couples the Incarnation to the doctrine of adoption (John 1:12). Paul exults in the Incarnation as the grounds of the reconciliation of all things, humanity included (Col 1:19–20). Moreover, he explicitly couples the Messiah’s full humanity to humans being filled in him in turn (Col. 2:9–10)—a theme Peter picks up as well, noting that the saints actually become “partakers of the divine nature” (2 Peter 1:4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, the New Testament affirms that the Incarnation itself was an essential element in the salvation of humanity—not merely as a prerequisite for other parts of Christ’s work. The Incarnation is the means by which human nature is brought once again into fellowship with the Godhead. Christ is the eschatological firstfruits of this restoration. As he is, so will all the saints be in glory: restored to unbroken fellowship between humanity and humanity’s Creator.&lt;a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="b.-the-theology-of-the-church" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;B. The Theology of the Church&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The importance of the Incarnation has been affirmed by the church throughout her history. The Church Fathers fleshed out the orthodox doctrine of the Incarnation over the first four centuries of the history of the church, with various controversies erupting every century.&lt;a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; This work culminated in the lasting affirmations and denials of the Chalcedonian formula.&lt;a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; In fact, nearly every theological controversy in the early church was a Christological controversy, and every such controversy hinged on issues pertaining to the nature of the Incarnation. The Fathers recognized that the details of God’s becoming man were essentials of the faith. The hope of human salvation would be lost entirely if Jesus were not a single person in whom “all the fullness of deity dwells bodily” (Col. 2:9) and who “likewise partook of [flesh and blood]” (Heb. 2:14).&lt;a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incarnational thoelogizing did not end in the patristic period; it has remained foundational for further reflection on the natures of God and humanity. Indeed, patristic theology has been influential on nearly every major orthodox theologian since the Reformation—whether directly or mediated by the Reformers. Athanasius’ Christology, with its emphasis on the transformational effect of the Incarnation itself on humanity’s state,&lt;a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has proven particularly influential. If advocates of “incarnational” theologies have sometimes pressed this recovery in unhelpful directions (see below), they have also provided a helpful reminder of what God’s becoming man has &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; accomplished: the first step of the eschatological transformation of humanity. “The crucified Christ stands in solidarity with humanity, not merely as ane xample of confrontation with the world to be imitated by us &lt;em&gt;but as the reality of new humanity in which we may and must participate&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Jesus’ humanity is an essential ingredient in human salvation and in the sanctified life of the believer in the present—the Spirit mediating Christ’s humanity to the believer’s—as well as of a glorified reality in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="ii.-in-life-and-ministry" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;II. In Life and Ministry&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the importance—indeed, the essential character—of the doctrine of the Incarnation, it is clear that the church must strive to maintain the doctrine. It is insufficent only to affirm it in principle; the church must cherish this reality in practice and protect it from loss. Unfortunately, both in the Western church broadly and in evangelicalism in particular, the centrality and uniqueness of the Incarnation have sometimes been lost through neglect or abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="a.-absence" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A. Absence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The church may first of all fail with regard to its theology of the Incarnation by losing it, whether by doctrinal negation or by simple unobservance. The threat of outright denial of the doctrine has been dangerously common in church history. As noted above, many of the early Christological heresies relted directly to the nature of the Incarnation, and variations on these heresies have continued to arise to the present day. In the Reformation era, for example, the Anabaptist movement included many who affirmed a “heavenly flesh” view in which Jesus was not Mary’s descendant but sent from heaven without human parentage whatsoever—a loss of Christ’s full humanity. More recently, both Mormons and Jehovah’s Witnesses have affirmed adoptionist views—a loss of Christ’s full deity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anti-supernatural bent of many liberal theologies in the last several centuries has similarly resulted in a rejection of the doctrine of the Incarnation. For many liberals theologians, Jesus was representative of the God-consciousness in us all at its best and adopted by God as a special figure in human history accordingly.&lt;a href="#fn9" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref9"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Any such outright rejection clearly results in the loss of all that the doctrine entails—not least any hope of real salvation. If Jesus was merely a man who was particularly helpful or holy, he could not redeem other humans. He could at best set others a good example. His death and his resurrection&lt;a href="#fn10" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref10"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; can have symbolic power only. They do not save. They inspire or impress at best, and intimidate with their inimitability at worst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All such views leave those who embrace them without ultimate salvific hope. As Gregory Nazianzen commented during the Arian controversy, “For that which He has not assumed he has not healed; but that which is united to His Godhead is also saved. If only half Adam fell, then that which Christ assumes and saves may be half also; but if the whole of his nature fell, it must be united to the whole nature of Him that was begotten, and so be saved as a whole.”&lt;a href="#fn11" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref11"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though no conservative scholars would actively deny the importance of the Incarnation, their passive neeglect can be nearly as problematic. Sadly, the doctrine receives receives little attention among evangelicals. The crucicentric bent of the evangelical movement has often led to other aspects of the Son’s work being overlooked, so that the Incarnation, Resurrection, and Ascension of Christ are all often treated as mere prerequisites for or accessories to his atoning death.&lt;a href="#fn12" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref12"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Even when unintentional, this loss-by-neglect results in real problems in the church’s understanding of God’s work in Christ and humanity. Many of the borderline gnostic tendencies latent in evangelical theology eschatology, and the corresponding spiritualization and de-physicalization of evangelical eschatology, must be laid at least in part at the feet of a deficient theology of the Incarnation. This can only lead to a dimming of future hope—who really wants to be a disembodied spirit somehow strumming a harp forever?—which in turn produces real challenges in the life and faith of believers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="b.-incarnational-theology-a-two-fold-error" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;B. “Incarnational Theology”: A Two-Fold Error&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The church may also err by misapplying its theology of the Incarnation. It has become increasingly common to speak of “incarnational theology” as a way of describing the Christian mission to the world: Christians ought to “incarnate” Christ to the world as Christ “incarnated” the Godhead to humanity.&lt;a href="#fn13" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref13"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; There is much to appreciate in this sentiment. It represents an appropriate recognition that humans are God’s image-bearers. It pays heed to the New Testament’s assertion that Christians are representatives of Christ. It takes seriously Paul’s shocking language of “filling up what is lacking in Christ’s afflictions” (Col. 1:24). It rightly points to the synthesis of missionary activity and social activism that represents the best of evangelicalism.&lt;a href="#fn14" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref14"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Yet for all that, applying the language of incarnation to believers is a serious mistake in two ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, this kind of “incarnational” language is a misapplication of Paul’s “body” metaphor for the church, contra the proponents of “incarnational theology”, and notwithstanding Scripture’s many calls to imitate Christ.&lt;a href="#fn15" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref15"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Paul uniformly used the language to teach the unity of the people of God—never evangelism. The authors of the New Testament chose other images for proclaiming Christ instead: fishermen (Matt. 4:19), harvest workers (Luke 10:2), servants working in the absence of their master (Matt. 24:45–51), or ambassadors and representatives (2 Cor. 5:20)—to name just a few. At no point, though, does the Bible use the metaphor of the body to describe Christian witness to the world. Nor does it support the idea that ordinary men and women can mediate the presence of God to people. The Incarnation may (and indeed should) prompt evangelism, but this response is not itself “incarnational.” The people of God do not incarnate God the Son, but represent him in other ways. That does not negate the helpful instincts expressed in the incarnational theologizing of the last few years. It simply means that this doctrine can be expressed more accurately and helpfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the church loses a great deal when incarnational theology is about anyone other than Jesus. God becoming man was an astounding and singular event. As Lewis commented, “It was the central event in the history of the Earth—the very thing that the whole story has been about.”&lt;a href="#fn16" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref16"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; When theologians speak of “incarnating” Christ, the sheer shock of the event fades. The focus shifts from the Son’s work in humanity to the human response to the Son. The doctrine of the Incarnation above all ought to lead to worship born of reflection not on human endeavors, but on divine intervention to undo human brokenness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="iii.-conclusion" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;III. Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both the centrality of the Incarnation and its uniqueness are essential to healthy Christian theology. A robust doctrine of the Incarnation leads to greater worship and deeper future hope. Understood rightly, it leads to deeper faith in the Word who “became flesh and dwelt among us” (John 1:14), and so to more faithful obedience to the gospel. The believer seeks peace and justice and above all that others may know Christ not because the he himself incarnates Christ, but because the Incarnation has produced a radical transformation in his life (and in the lives of all who believe). “Christ gives his sanctified humanity to us, so that we may partake of him and his goodness…. God assumed our umanity in Jesus of Nazareth, healed our humanity with his own being, and gave our sanctified humanity back to us.”&lt;a href="#fn17" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref17"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The church must therefore take care to protect the doctrine, both from reject or loss through neglect and from misappropriations of the language of incarnation that distract from the work of the Son. The Incarnation itself is essential and central in God’s work in the life of believers. It must never be obscured, diminished, or denied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="appendix-the-chalcedonian-definition" class="level1"&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Appendix: The Chalcedonian Definition&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#fn18" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref18"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;For the synod is opposed to those who presume to rend asunder the mystery of the Incarnation into a double Sonship, and it deposes from the priesthood those who dare to say that the Godhead of the Only-begotten is passible; and it withstands those who imagine a mixing or confusion of the two natures of Christ; and it drives away those who erroneously teach that the form of a servant which he took from us was of a heavenly or some other substance; and it anathematizes those who feign that the Lord had two natures before the union, but that these were fashioned into one after the union.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wherefore, following the holy Fathers, we all with one voice confess our Lord Jesus Christ one and the same Son, the same perfect in Godhead, the same perfect in manhood, truly God and truly man, the same consisting of a reasonable soul and a body, of one substance with the Father as touching the Godhead, the same of one substance with us as touching the manhood, like us in all things apart from sin; begotten of the Father before the ages as touching the Godhead, the same in the last days, for us and for our salvation, born from the Virgin Mary, the Theotokos, as touching the manhood, one and the same Christ, Son, Lord, Only-begotten, to be acknowledged in two natures, without confusion, without change, without division, without separation; the distinction of natures being in no way abolished because of the union, but rather the characteristic property of each nature being preserved, and concurring into one Person and one subsistence (ὑπόστασις), not as if Christ were parted or divided into two persons, but one and the same Son and only-begotten God, Word, Lord, Jesus Christ; even as the Prophets from the beginning spoke concerning him, and our Lord Jesus Christ instructed us, and the Creed of the Fathers has handed down to us.&lt;/p&gt;

The properties of divinity and humanity &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; fully existed in Jesus the Messiah; they did not cross into each other, but were united in the Son. The Son then could choose to use whichever attributes were appropriate to him at a given time: he could both ride in a boat (consistent with being a human being) or forgive sins (consistenly only with being God). This carries through to all aspects of the Son’s work upon his incarnation: he has a human will and a divine will, neither of which overrides the other but both of which are exercised together as appropriate. The divine will is already in line with the will of the Father; the human will he chooses to subject to the Father. By analogy: one may know both English and French, and if so one speaks each language as appropriate—there is no implied division in a person simply because he knows more than one language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This communication of attributes was accomplished so that no part of either the Son’s pre-existing humanity divinity or newly-embraced humanity was either changed or diminished in the Incarnation. The two were &lt;em&gt;united&lt;/em&gt;, but they were not altered or subsumed. This important reality was articulated in the four negations of the Chalcedonian definition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Jesus, the two natures were united &lt;em&gt;without confusion&lt;/em&gt;. The Incarnation was not like mixing wine and water to produce a &lt;em&gt;tertium quid&lt;/em&gt;, a third thing like both of the others but not actually either of them, even while no longer distinguishable from each other. Jesus was both God and man, not a new thing that was neither wholly God nor wholly man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Jesus, the two natures were united &lt;em&gt;without diminishing&lt;/em&gt;. The Incarnation was not like putting a drop of wine in the ocean so that the wine simply dissipates and is meaningless. Thus Apollinarian view that the Son’s divine nature subsumed and overwhelmed the human nature was rejected. In Jesus both human and divine natures were fully present, and neither overwhelmed the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Jesus, the two natures were united &lt;em&gt;without mixture&lt;/em&gt;. The Incarnation was not the result of combining two things that were unlike to produce a new thing which could still be separated into the old things. In other words, the Son’s becoming man was not like sodium joining with chloride to produce salt, which is entirely different from either sodium or chloride.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Jesus, the two natures were united &lt;em&gt;without separating&lt;/em&gt;. The Incarnation was not like bundling together a pair of sticks which could just as easily be pulled apart. The Son did not shed his humanity upon his resurrection or his ascension; he remains now and forever a human being as well as divine. Thus all the experiences, actions, and sayings of Jesus are attributable to one person (rather than suggesting that the divine Son did some things and the human being did another—one stick and another stick acting in distinct ways). Rather, one person, Jesus, walked (and walks) with both natures, lived (and lives) both kinds of lives, existed (and exists) in both ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the attributes of God and of humanity were both &lt;em&gt;communicated&lt;/em&gt;—they had communion—in Christ. In Jesus, the human and divine did not mingle into a distinctionless soup, did not overwhelm each other, cannot be separated, and did not create some new thing unlike human or God. Jesus is fully God and fully man, forever.&lt;/p&gt;

Div.</category><category>SEBTS</category></item><item><title>Perfectionism</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/perfectionism.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;The theory of perfectionism suggests that believers ultimately come to a point in their &lt;em&gt;present&lt;/em&gt; walk with God where they stop willfully sinning. This stands in contrast to non-perfectionistic views which believe the end of willful sin comes only at &lt;em&gt;glorification&lt;/em&gt; after one’s death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern perfectionism was advocated by John Wesley at some points during his ministry and adopted as a hallmark of the Wesleyan tradition (though Wesley himself abandoned the view late in life). In the Wesleyan view, the believer at some point during his life experiences a “second blessing” in which the Holy Spirit supernaturally empowers the believer to overcome the rest of his natural (fleshly) tendency toward sin. This moment must be apprehended by the believer in faith—it is not guaranteed to all believers but is granted to those who seek it in faith. The Wesleyans draw this view primarily from the apostle John’s note that “No one who lives in [Christ] keeps on sinning” (1 John 3:6), as well as from various other passages which suggest that Christians may &lt;em&gt;stop&lt;/em&gt; sinning. Moreover, they note the biblical commands to holiness and argue that these strongly imply (if not demand) that believers be able actually to live truly holy lives. Thus, believers should pray regularly for this empowering act of the Spirit in their lives so that they may fulfill God’s will that they be truly holy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The view has some significant and serious problems, not least in the &lt;em&gt;rest&lt;/em&gt; of the book from which they primarily draw their support: John himself notes that when (not if) believers sin, they have an advocate with the Father in the person of Jesus himself (1 John 2:1). Similarly, the testimony of Paul and his ongoing struggles with sin after conversion and his explicit denial of having reached perfection (cf. Romans 7, Philippians 2) indicates that even for extraordinarily faithful believers, perfection will remain an unfilled but longed-for state until death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practically, the view readily leads to frustration and even despair on the one hand or profound hubris on the other. Those who, despite their pleading and (true!) faith do not have any experience of “second blessing” and instead remain aware of their ongoing struggle with sin may find themselves thinking they are simply weak in the faith and that they will never accomplish God’s plan for their holiness. This could not be further from the truth: those most faithfully walking with God are in fact those &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; aware of their own sinfulness. On the other hand, those who think they have found this holiness end up self-deceived. They proclaim their own sinlessness, and prove hypocrites. They may end up holding themselves up as superior to others (even if only in their own minds). They certainly will not go on as they ought in the process of mortifying their own sins, because they are convinced they have none.&lt;/p&gt;

Div.</category><category>SEBTS</category></item><item><title>The Divinity of Jesus</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/the-divinity-of-jesus.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;The divinity of Jesus is and has been from the beginning a core component of the Christian faith. There are several reasons why Christians have always affirmed and indeed &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; affirm the deity of Christ. First, Scripture itself clearly testifies to the fully deity of Jesus as the Son of God. To name just a few:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Incarnation passage in John&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thomas’ outburst of faith, “My lord and my God!” to Jesus upon his resurrection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thomas’ outburst of faith, “My lord and my God!” to Jesus upon his resurrection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the quotes throughout the New Testament but especially in Hebrews where God is quoted as addressing Jesus as God&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the quotes throughout the New Testament but especially in Hebrews where God is quoted as addressing Jesus as God&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the obvious reality that the early church prayed to and worshipped Jesus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the Christian is first of all obliged by the Scriptures to acknowledge Jesus as God. Beyond this, however, is the reason that it had to be God Incarnate who saved human beings and not merely another human being (still less any other created thing). First, salvation entails reconciliation between God and humanity. That is, the salvation Christ accomplished was not only between God and human beings as individuals, but between God and &lt;em&gt;human nature&lt;/em&gt; which was broken in the fall and separated from God in whose image it was made. That Christ is the image of the invisible God (Colossians 1:15, Hebrews 1:3) is not only an affirmation of the nature of the divine Son but an affirmation of the restored humanity of Jesus the Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, Jesus was a substitution for human sins. For this he of course had to be a human being (as the author of Hebrews notes: the blood of sheep and goats could not make purification for human sins). However, he had also to be God. Even if one mere human lived a perfectly sinless life, this perfect life would not be transferrable to another human being: it would be his alone, and would have no extra righteousness to give to another. But Jesus is fully God, and has &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; righteousness. Indeed, it is the righteousness of God—infinite, boundless, untainted by sin—that Christians receive by faith. It is not one man’s righteousness somehow wafted across a courtroom (to borrow N. T. Wright’s metaphor), but the righteousness of God in which humans participate because they are united with Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, Jesus came to overcome death. To die, he had to be a man, but to bring life he had to be God. Human beings do not have in themselves the power of life (still less to overcome death)—but God whose very name is “I AM”/“HE IS” has life in himself. Jesus the divine Son had and has life &lt;em&gt;in himself&lt;/em&gt;, and he therefore can and did overcome death. In his restored humanity, death no longer has any power. His resurrection was the first moment when this divine power of life broke into the fallen reality and gave a formerly mortal human body immortality. Believers have in one sense already died and been raised in him, and in another sense look forward to a fuller participation in that divine reality of life that does not end. Death died in the resurrection because Christ was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; merely a man, because his return from the grave was not like Lazarus’ a mere rescuscitation but the triumph of divine life over human frailty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being right with God is a complex and multifaceted reality. To understand it, however, one must understand how &lt;em&gt;God&lt;/em&gt; is just and righteous, because Christian righteousness is &lt;em&gt;Christ’s&lt;/em&gt; righteousness (2 Corinthians 5:21). God’s righteousness is intrinsic to him; it is expressed in his righteous deeds, most especially in judging justly. His justice, in turn, is expressed in the most gracious and merciful manner imaginable: he punished sin and defeated death in himself, rather than in the people who deserved punishment and had brought death on themselves. Moreover, he also removes the power of sin in their lives so that they ultimately may &lt;em&gt;stop&lt;/em&gt; breaking fellowship with him and each other and may stop acting in such a way as to earn the penalty of sin (death). So God’s justice and righteousness are seen in that he restores people to unbroken relationship with him, removes from them not only their guilt but their brokenness and inevitable tendency toward sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this is the righteousness that is granted to Christians in Christ, then it is more than (though not less than) a change in judicial state before God. Christians have forensic justification in Christ—they are declared “not guilty” in him—because they are united with him. Colossians 2:9–14 drives home this connection clearly: believers are filled in Christ, buried in death and raised to life with him in baptism. This new life and participation in Christ is then the grounds of God’s setting aside the legal demands that stood against the believer: they are nailed to the cross because Christ was nailed to the cross and the believer &lt;em&gt;is in Christ&lt;/em&gt;. All trespasses are forgiven, because the believer is no longer operating under his own nature but is full of Christ, and in Christ the fullness of God dwells bodily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So then to be justified, to be made right with God, is to have all of Christ’s righteousness as &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; one’s own. It is not a legal fiction, but a spiritual reality. The believer is right with God; he may not always live in accord with this reality, but he is. By analogy: a husband is always married to his wife; even if he strays by cheating on her, he remains truly married to her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This view of justification cuts off at its core any kind of works-righteousness view of righteousness. The righteousness that believers possess is always entirely God’s righteousness mediated to them by the Spirit through their participation in the resurrected Son. It is not, as in the Roman Catholic view, participatory righteousness in which the believer contributes his own righteousness (even if by faith and the Spirit’s power) and the remainder is accomplished by God. Nor is it that God &lt;em&gt;chooses&lt;/em&gt; to see the believer as if he is righteous when in actuality he is not (yet) righteous because sanctification is incomplete. Rather, no part of the believer’s righteousness—right state, and not only right standing—is his own. Rather, it is always all of God. When acting righteously, one &lt;em&gt;demonstrates&lt;/em&gt; that one is justified, but whoever is in Christ is already truly righteous.&lt;/p&gt;

Div.</category><category>SEBTS</category></item><item><title>The Spirit's Work in Conversion (redux)</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/the-spirits-work-in-conversion-redux.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;The Holy Spirit’s work in conversion, as in all the works of the Spirit, is the part of executing the will of the Father in the person of the Son. The Spirit brought about the Incarnation, and raised Jesus from the dead; now the Spirit makes the Son’s work efficacious in the hearts of believers. The Father originated the work of salvation; the Son (in his incarnation, life, death, resurrection, and ascension) was and is the means of salvation; the Spirit is the one who guarantees and accomplishes salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To begin, the Spirit opens unbelievers’ eyes to their need for salvation. Sinners apart from the Spirit are lost and hopeless, with either no awareness of need for God (passivity) or an active rejection of God (rebellion). The Spirit opens an unregenerate individual to see his need for salvation, providing an awareness of sinfulness and separation from God, and prompting desire for restored relationship and righteousness. This all happens in the preaching of the gospel, which the Spirit makes effective in the person’s mind—even as the Spirit was responsible for the existence of the gospel in Scripture to begin with. Thus the Spirit inspired the words of the gospel and then brings them to fruition: the Spirit is executor of God’s will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the Spirit enables faith in Jesus Christ as the resurrected Son of God, as savior and lord.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; In this recognition of one’s need and decisive change in the will—toward rather than away from God—the Spirit brings about the regeneration of the human heart. Regeneration unites the new believer to Jesus Christ: he comes to participate in the Son’s perfected, divinized humanity. Indeed, believers “become partakers of the divine nature” (2 Peter 1:4). Where once the believer’s heart rejected God, God now appears good and delightful and worthy of worship and trust. Where once one thought nothing of engaging in sin, one now increasingly hates and rejects sin and strives to sin no more. The Spirit replaces a heart of stone with a heart of flesh, and moves believers from darkness to light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having accomplished the salvation of an individual soul, the Spirit brings the believer into the community of faith. No person’s salvation is singular or independent. Maturity and completion happen as one participates in the restoration of relationship not only with God but with other human beings. The people of God all participate &lt;em&gt;together&lt;/em&gt; through the Spirit in Jesus the Son. It is the Spirit who makes the people of God the body of Christ. And the Spirit seals the people of God for redemption, keeping them steadfast in their faith as they build one another up through fellowship and the proclamation of the word and participation in the ordinances—all of which are Spirit-empowered to continue God’s gracious work in the believer’s life, leading ultimately to final salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Believers have differed on the particulars of this enabling throughout history, but all affirm that the Spirit does indeed enable faith as a minimum assertion. My own position is that the Spirit does not only &lt;em&gt;enable&lt;/em&gt; faith but &lt;em&gt;supplies&lt;/em&gt; it to hearts which would otherwise reject God. That is, the Spirit is not merely the ultimate ground but also the proximate cause of regeneration.&lt;a href="#fnref1"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

I enjoy Kindle and iPad, but I still love books best. Turns out I’m not alone… and there might just be reason for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/05/reading-on-screen-versus-paper/"&gt;Brandon Keim at Wired:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paper books were supposed to be dead by now. For years, information theorists, marketers, and early adopters have told us their demise was imminent. Ikea even redesigned a bookshelf to hold something other than books. Yet in a world of screen ubiquity, many people still prefer to do their serious reading on paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Count me among them. When I need to read deeply—when I want to lose myself in a story or an intellectual journey, when focus and comprehension are paramount—I still turn to paper. Something just feels fundamentally richer about reading on it. And researchers are starting to think there’s something to this feeling.&lt;/p&gt;

Both are primarily reading devices for me. What is different is the kinds of material I read on each.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Kindle is a first generation Paperwhite, in fairly good condition. (It has one significant quirk in that it sometimes turns on without the power button being pushed. Alas.) I use it nearly every day right now. I have most of my school books on it, and several of my favorite novels. I’m rereading Patrick Rothfuss’ &lt;em&gt;The Wise Man’s Fear&lt;/em&gt; right now, and so I spend a good half a hour a day on the Kindle for that alone. I also get a lot of my seminary reading done on the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the iPad, on the other hand, I read a lot of web pages, nearly all via &lt;a href="https://www.instapaper.com"&gt;Instapaper&lt;/a&gt;. I had sometimes had Instapaper items delivered to my Kindle, and that worked &lt;em&gt;fairly&lt;/em&gt; well, but I much prefer the experience of using the app on the iPad. I opt to do pretty much any technical reading on the device: its screen just works much better for dealing with things like code samples embedded in a blog post—not least because I can scroll easily if I need to! I also do basically all my Bible reading on the iPad. It is far easier to navigate to different parts of the text, switch translations (or original languages!) while keeping my place there on any of the top-tier iPad apps than on the Kindle. And I sometimes read comics on the iPad—something I would not try in a million years on the current Kindle screen!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend asked a few months ago if I thought one would obviate the other. Given the qualification that neither is in any sense truly a &lt;em&gt;necessity&lt;/em&gt;—we could quite easily get along without either—my answer after several months with both is &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt;. Though the devices are similar in a number of ways, they fit into very different niches. The things I actively enjoy on each are very different. The Kindle is good for much longer-form reading, and its lack of distractions is nice (though I often take advantage of the Do Not Disturb mode on the iPad when I actually want to accomplish things besides talking on social media). The iPad is better for anything with color, for technical documents, and for anything where navigation more complex than one-page-after-another is important. I would not particularly want to read a novel on it, though!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be curious to see if the devices converge at some point in the future.&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; At present, no technology gives both the responsiveness and gorgeous color of the iPad &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the low-contrast, pleasant long-form reading experience offered by the Kindle’s e-ink. If at some point we get a technology that does both, it will be pretty amazing. In the meantime… we still have pretty amazing pieces of technology, and I enjoy them both a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also use the iPad for a number of other things: App.net and Twitter and so on, &lt;a href="http://www.fiftythree.com"&gt;Paper&lt;/a&gt;, starting some ideas for blog posts, etc. But mainly I read on it!&lt;a href="#fnref1"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;No, Amazon’s Kindle Fire series of tablets are nothing like that convergence: they are &lt;em&gt;functionally&lt;/em&gt; just poor-man’s-iPads hooked into Amazon’s ecosystem. Note that I’m not making a comment about the quality or lack thereof on the devices—only that they’re much reduced in capabilities compared to an iPad or Android (e.g. Nexus 7).&lt;a href="#fnref2"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

I’m going to go ahead and do like I wrote &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/doing-it-myself.html"&gt;a bit back&lt;/a&gt;, and make &lt;a href="http://step-stool.io"&gt;Step Stool&lt;/a&gt; actually a thing over the course of the rest of the year. Not so crazy. What is a bit nuts is the way I’ve decided to go about that process. In short: as close to the hardest way possible as I can conceive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last couple weeks, I’ve been spending a fair bit of time toying with &lt;a href="http://iolanguage.org"&gt;Io&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a neat little language, very different in its approach to a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of things than the languages I’ve used previously. My programming language history is very focused on the “normal” languages. The vast majority of real- world code I’ve written has been in one of C, PHP, or Python. I’ve done a good bit of Javascript along the way, more Fortran than anyone my age has any business having done, and a little each of Java and Ruby. Like I said: the normal ones. With the exception of Javascript, all of those are either standard imperative, object-oriented, or mixed imperative and object-oriented languages. Python and Ruby both let you mix in a fair bit of functional-style programming, and Javascript does a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of that and tosses in prototypal inheritance to boot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But still: they’re all pretty mainstream, “normal” languages. Io isn’t like that at all. For one thing, it’s hardly popular in any sense at all. Well-known among the hackers&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I know, perhaps, but not popular by any measure. It’s small. And it’s very &lt;em&gt;alien&lt;/em&gt; in some ways. It’s &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype-based_programming"&gt;prototypal inheritance&lt;/a&gt;, not normal inheritance. Courtesy of &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain"&gt;Javascript&lt;/a&gt;, I have a &lt;em&gt;little&lt;/em&gt; familiarity with that, but it’s definitely still not my default way of thinking about inheritance. Python’s inheritance model (the one I use most frequently) is &lt;em&gt;essentially&lt;/em&gt; the same as that in C++, Java, PHP, and so on—it’s normal class-driven inheritance. Io goes off and does full-blown prototypal inheritance; even just the little I’ve played with it has been fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Io also does a bunch of other things a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; different from the other languages I’ve used. First, there are no keywords or—formally speaking—even operators in the language. Every action (including ones like &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt;) is simply a message. Every value is an object (so &lt;code&gt;1.0&lt;/code&gt; is just as fully an object as an arbitrarily-defined &lt;code&gt;Person&lt;/code&gt;). The combination means that writing &lt;code&gt;1 + 2&lt;/code&gt; is actually just interpreted as the object &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; receiving the &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; message carrying as its “argument” the &lt;code&gt;2&lt;/code&gt; object (really just the message contents). This is &lt;em&gt;completely&lt;/em&gt; different at a deep paradigm level from the normal object-oriented approach with object methods, even in a language like Python where all elements are objects (including functions). The net result isn’t necessarily particularly different from calling methods on objects, but it is a &lt;em&gt;little&lt;/em&gt; different, with have some interesting consequences. Notably (though trivially—or at least, so it seems to me at this point), you can pass a message to the null object without it being an error. More importantly, the paradigm shift is illuminating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Io also has far more capabilities in terms of concurrency than any of the other languagues with which I’m familiar, because it actively implements the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model"&gt;Actor Model&lt;/a&gt;, which means its implementation of messaging instead of object method calls can behave in concurrent ways. (I’d say more if I understood it better. I don’t yet, which is one of the reasons I want to study the language. Concurrency is very powerful, but it’s also fairly foreign to me.) It’s also like Lisp in that its code can be inspected and modified at runtime. I’ve wanted to learn a Lisp for several years for this kind of mental challenge, but the syntax has always just annoyed me too much ever to get there. Io will give me a lot of its benefits with a much more pleasant syntax. It has coroutines, which are new to me, and also helpful for concurrency.&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The long and short of it is that the language has a ton of features not present in the languages I have used, and—more importantly—is &lt;em&gt;paradigmatically&lt;/em&gt; different from them. Just getting familiar with it by writing a goodly amount of code in it would be a good way to learn in practice a bunch of computer science concepts I never had a chance to learn formally.&lt;a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By now, as long as I’ve rambled about Io, you’ve probably figured out where I was going in that first paragraph. I’ve decided to stretch my brain a bit and write Step Stool in Io. There are bunches of static site generators out there in Python already, many of them quite mature. (This site is running on &lt;a href="https://github.com/getpelican"&gt;one of them&lt;/a&gt; as of the time I write this post—it’s quite solid, even its quirks and limitations occasionally annoy me.) The point of Step Stool has always been twofold, though. First, I’ve wanted to get to a spot where I was really running my own software to manage my site, letting me do whatever I want with it and guaranteeing I always understand it well enough to make those kinds of changes. Second, I’ve just wanted to &lt;em&gt;learn&lt;/em&gt; a whole bunch along the way. Third, it’s right there in the website link: &lt;a href="http://step-stool.io"&gt;step-stool.io&lt;/a&gt;! How could I pass up such an opportunity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is that second goal that has pushed me to do this crazy project this crazy way. It’s crazier than just teaching myself a language in order to do the static site generator itself, too, because there are a few other pieces missing that I’ll need to write to make this work… like a Markdown implementation and an HTML templating language. I’ve never written anything remotely like either before, so I’m going to take the chance to learn a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of new things. For the Markdown implementation, rather than relying on regular expression parsing (like most Markdowns do), I’m going to use a Parsing Expression Grammar. That will certainly be more efficient and reliable, but—more importantly—it is also outside my experience. I have yet to start thinking through how to tackle the HTML templating language implementation (though I know I am going to make it an Io implementation of &lt;a href="http://slim-lang.com"&gt;Slim&lt;/a&gt;, which I quite like).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, I’m going to be taking a good bit longer to get Step Stool finished. That is all right: I am going to learn a ton along the way, and I am quite sure I will have a blast doing it. And that is &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; what these kinds of projects are for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll post updates as I go, with the things I’m learning along the way. Hopefully they’ll be interesting (or at least entertaining).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id="fn2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Python 3.5 is actually adding coroutines, and I’m excited about that. I’ll feel much more comfortable with them there having used them in Io, I’m sure!&lt;a href="#fnref2"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn3"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I got here backwards, as it were—by way of an undergraduate degree in physics. I don’t regret that for a second: I got a much broader education than I could have managed while getting an engineering degree, and most importantly learned &lt;em&gt;how to learn&lt;/em&gt;: easily the most important skill anyone gains from any engineering degree.&lt;a href="#fnref3"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

Those of us who are in Christ are, by the grace of God, slowly being transformed into that &lt;em&gt;something more&lt;/em&gt;. We are being made like God. This is the essential nature of the process of sanctification: slow transformation from our current state into the image of God. Sanctification is one of the most important ideas in the Bible, and many things besides people were sanctified in the course of salvation history. Sanctification is being set apart for service to God, being made “holy” —including especially the various elements used in the pre-Christ sacrificial system. This kind of holiness entails both moral uprightness and distinction from the mundane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We first recognize that moral failure is a reality—a sad and tragic reality, but a reality nonetheless—in the life of the Christian. Even after experiencing regeneration and justification, we remain &lt;em&gt;simultus justus et peccator&lt;/em&gt;, to borrow Luther’s famous phrase: simultaneously justified and yet sinners. We remain in the world &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; of the world, rather than in it but not of it. We are not yet wholly set apart for God’s works, but too often continue to pursue fallen ends via fallen means. We need to be transformed so that we pursue God’s ends (ultimately: God himself) as he has called us, rather than the things of the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But God in his wisdom has ordained that we &lt;em&gt;grow&lt;/em&gt; into this. We are justified at a single moment by faith in Christ, and our sanctification will ultimately be finished in a single moment when we are glorified upon our death. In the interval, though, God has called us to pursue him, to strive for the holiness which Christ exemplified for us. As we do, we learn to trust him more and rely more thoroughly on his power and wisdom rather than our own, and this too is part of the process of sanctification. When we are perfected, it will not be a matter of suddenly being able to do on our own what we could not before, but rather that we will finally depend wholly on God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this we are growing into the full maturity of humanity. Our model is Jesus Christ: the God-man who shows us what it means to be a perfect human being. He taught us over and over again not only by example but by direct affirmation that his life was characterized above all by dependence on his Father and that he acted not on his own power but that of the Spirit. In our sanctification, we learn to walk the same way. As in our justification, this comes about because we are being united to Christ by the indwelling Spirit—so our growing humanity is also growing to participate in the life of the Trinity. We pursue the Father and his ways, empowered by the Spirit to partake of Christ’s risen, divinized humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This way of putting it is often jarring to western theologians, but is fully orthodox and has been part of the Eastern Orthodox tradition for sixteen centuries and more. It draws directly on the language of 2 Peter 1:4, which reminds us that we are partakers of the divine nature. It was on that very basis that Peter laid out his enjoinder to grow in the various measures of sanctification: faith, virtue, knowledge, self-control, steadfastness, godliness, brotherly affection, and love (a list that bears what is surely not a coincidental similarity to Paul’s fruit of the Spirit). Sanctification is our wholehearted pursuit of the things of God, not on our own power but by his gracious work in us, until we someday attain to full maturity and depend wholly on the Spirit’s uniting us to Christ.&lt;/p&gt;

Div.</category><category>SEBTS</category></item><item><title>We Are Not Alone</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/we-are-not-alone.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I came to the end of Psalm 77 and knew that the editors of the Psalms must have had the same feeling I did. “And then what happened?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Psalm of Asaph is one of those laments that does not hesitate to ask hard questions of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cry aloud to God,&lt;br /&gt;
    aloud to God, and he will hear me.&lt;br /&gt;
In the day of my trouble I seek the Lord;&lt;br /&gt;
    in the night my hand is stretched out without wearying;&lt;br /&gt;
    my soul refuses to be comforted.&lt;br /&gt;
When I remember God, I moan;&lt;br /&gt;
    when I meditate, my spirit faints. Selah&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You hold my eyelids open;&lt;br /&gt;
    I am so troubled that I cannot speak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Psalm 77:1–4 ESV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think every person who lives long enough comes to know this feeling. We face hard times in this fallen world. We ourselves suffer, and we watch the people around us suffer. We see our communities—our churches, our neighborhoods, our nations—stumble and falter. We long for things to be set right, and they have &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; yet been set right. Even the thought of God is hard (v. 3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Asaph looks to God anyway. The rest of the Psalm turns and faces the character and history of God. It asks the hard questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;| Has his steadfast love forever ceased? | Are his promises at an end for all time? | Has God forgotten to be gracious? | Has he in anger shut up his compassion?&amp;quot; (Psalm 77:8–9, ESV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asaph’s answer is straightforward: “I will remember the deeds of Yahweh” (v. 11). And the rest of the Psalm is just that: a reflection on the creative power of God—with a turn just twice to God’s work in his people (vv. 15, 20). Our God is the God who made the heavens and the earth, to whom belong storms and seas and every mighty, awesome thing we see around us. From him comes salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, with “You led your people like a flock / by the hand of Moses and Aaron” (v. 20) the Psalm simply comes to an end. We are left hanging. The editor of the Psalms (and perhaps Asaph himself) recognized that there is more to say into our sorrows and our grief—more to say about who God is and has been not only in the structure of the world but in the history of his people. So the answer continues: Psalm 78 takes up that theme of God’s leading his people by the hand of Moses and Aaron and expands it into a full-fledged poetic history of Yahweh’s work in the people of Israel (one of several such in the Psalms).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psalm 77 reminds us that our God owns the thunderbolts, and punctuates that sentiment with the reminder that he saves his people. It stands as a monument to the reality that God has all the power he could possibly need to save his people, to show them the steadfast love and compassion that seemed absent when Asaph penned the lament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psalm 78 in turn reminds us that Yahweh is more than a sugar-daddy who dances to our whims. He is the God who saves us, yes; he is also the God who judges us and brings righteousness about &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; his people as well as &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; his people. The people sin (just as we sin!) and &lt;em&gt;God&lt;/em&gt; atones for them (and for us!) even as he judges them (even as he judges us!). It also reminds us that we are not alone. It situates our suffering and struggles against the backdrop of God’s work with his people, of whom we are a part. We are not individuals drifting through life alone, but part of the people of God, both immediately in our local church and broadly in the history of the world. We must situate our struggles and our challenges and our pains against that broader story—not diminishing them, but recognizing that they are part of a larger tapestry. And that tapestry is from the hands of a master weaver. He knows what he is about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we face the hard realities of life, then, these Psalms are standing stones that point us back to our rock. Even when the thought of God itself makes us weary and bitter, we must look to him. Who is he? What has he done? Is he not powerful enough to save, and has his work before not shown that he will indeed save? Is he not trustworthy? He is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do not always know the reasons God allows and ordains the struggles and travails we face. Indeed: often we do not. We do know the God who is with us in those trials, though. He is the God who has atoned for us when we were still in the act of rebelling against him, and who did so by taking up humanity himself, walking this broken world to heal our hurts. As Hebrews reminds us: the high priest we have is one who &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; sympathize with our weaknesses. We are not alone: not even in the darkest night, when prayer itself makes us faint. God is with us. Immanuel. The Spirit indwells. Thanks be to God.&lt;/p&gt;

The word “justify” and its nominal forms are used to translate words from the &lt;em&gt;dikaoō&lt;/em&gt; (δικαιόω) word group in Greek, which includes a number of related concepts, all circling in various ways around the notion of justice and right action and just and righteous character. Since “justification”—being justified—before God is a central idea in Scripture and an essential element of our salvation, we should be careful to understand what exactly this concept means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most basically, for a person to be justified is for him or her to be righteous, and correspondingly to have acted rightly—in the eyes of God. At a bare minimum, this of course requires both the performance of good works and the rejection of sin. However, justification means more than simply having checked off a series of boxes corresponding to specific good works while having avoided other boxes corresponding to bad or sinful actions. It means being regarded as having done righteously and justly by God, and God sees our hearts, so even doing what is right and shunning what is wrong may not be sufficient: we often have entirely the wrong motives in such actions. We seek the approval of men instead of to please God; we want the social or personal benefits that follow from doing nice things for others; we enjoy stoking the fires of our own pride. In any case, we do not even act rightly, still less do so for the glory of God. So the idea that we might be justified on our own merits is hopeless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, we should note that ordinary notions of justification often tend to include many of the right (that is, Biblical) concepts of justification in them, but in shallower forms than Scripture supplies. In particular, the use of the term has shifted somewhat from when it was used to translate the word group from Greek into English. When we say, “he was justified,” we do not mean that someone did the right thing, but that whatever someone did, he had grounds for doing. We can of course turn this back to our needs by noting that we have grounds only for right-hearted obedience and none for sinning. Still, this is less than the biblical idea of justification—of being considered to have done rightly in every way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the “Christian” to be justified, we must be able to stand before God and he consider us righteous in every word and deed and thought and attitude of the heart. This happens in two ways (inseparable from each other): forensic justification and imputed righteousness through union with Christ. In “forensic justification,” God legally acquits us of guilt for committed sin and righteous deeds left undone. The list of offenses we committed was nailed to the cross (cf. Colossians 2:13–15). This can happen because we are united with Jesus the Son of God by the Spirit of God. As Paul notes in 2 Corinthians 5:21, the sinless Christ became sin that we might become the righteousness of God. All that is Christ’s is ours; we are one with him and so we have all his righteousness. (The word “righteousness” here derives from the same root as we translate “justification”—these ideas are inextricably linked.) Finally, God himself justifies us, calling us righteous, because Jesus Christ has both lived in perfect righteousness and paid the penalty for our sins, propitiating the wrath of God (cf. Romans 3).&lt;/p&gt;

I got sick—the kind of sick that makes you feel terrible and want to do nothing but sleep for days on end. The kind of sleep that makes you long for a resurrection body. Then my lovely wife got sick at the beginning of this week. Accordingly, I have not written these posts, nor (much worse) been as consistent in my readings as I would like. Still: here I am again, diving back in. The discipline of writing these posts continues to prove fruitful for me as an exercise in thinking rightly about God and in being consistent in my devotional reading. It also helps keep my wordsmithing at least a little fresh, even if I have noted that writing these little notes is a very different skill than writing academically or even longer-form blog posts. Still: much of four months in (and far too many days missed), this remains a valuable use of my time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading in Hebrews is always a source of enormous spiritual encouragement to me. I am not sure I could picka favorite book in the Bible: every time I read a bok again, Ifind new depths and treasures in it. A few do stand out, though: Isaiah, several of the minor prophets, Colossians, and Hebrews tend to speak to me with particular force. Whatever the reason—some mix of my personality and temperament with the things God desires to accomplish in me—Hebrews simply delights me time and again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading through these chapters, I am captured by the author’s emphasis on two realities. The first is the central thrust of the book: the supremacy of Jesus Christ over every would-be religious competitor, even the religious competitors of the tradition from which he came. For the author of this epistle, none of the trappings of Judaism—glorious and good though they were—could measure up to Jesus. But this is because of the second thing that always comes home in reading this letter: the author saw Jesus as the perfect fulfillment of all the things toward which Old Testament belief had pointed. The temple, the priesthood, the old kingship… all of these things were aiming for Jesus. When he came, there was no need for those old things: not because they were bad, but because they had been replaced by something impossibly better. The symbol had been supplanted by the reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is easy to take that for granted, living this side of the incarnation of God and this side of the inauguration of his kingdom. But we ought not. We ought to look at the Old Testament with joy that we see clearly what the prophets longed to see but &lt;em&gt;did not&lt;/em&gt;. We ought to read those pages of expectation and longing and exult that the longing has been satisified. Yes, we live still in the time between the times, when Christ has come but has yet to come again—but we live in the time between the times: Christ &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; come. All those pointers and prophecies and hints and hopes that ran from Adam through Noah down to Abraham and on past David’s kingdom into the words of the prophets and even in exile and return to the land—we see them clear as can be in God-the-Son who died on our behalf and lives on our behalf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a high priest who never dies again, and who therefore never has to lay aside his priesthood, never has to cease his prayers. We have a priest who had no need to atone for his own sin, but in his own self atoned for all our sin once and for all. We need no further sacrifices. We have a perfect intercessor. We have Jesus, author and perfector of our faith. We have everything we need, and more than we ever could have hoped. Hallelujah.&lt;/p&gt;

Peterson. Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1980. 241 pp. $20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="overview" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Five Smooth Stones for Pastoral Work&lt;/em&gt;, Eugene Peterson advocates for a biblically grounded rather than psychologically-driven approach to pastoral work. He argues that the idea that pastors must first of all be up to date and current has things precisely backwards: the pastor’s responsibility is to lead his congregation back to timeless realities, not into the hippest fads of the day. He suggests that the &lt;em&gt;Megilloth&lt;/em&gt;, the “five scrolls” of Songs of Songs, Ruth, Lamentations, Ecclesiastes, and Esther, have particular lessons to teach pastors as they seek to bring “what is essential in the human condition, not what is accicental” (p. 2) down into the “idiosyncrasies of the local and the personal” (p. 5). A failure either to hold fast to the eternal word and will of God, or to bring it home to those to whom the pastor ministers, will leave the people without what they most deeply need: a shepherd through the vagaries and trials of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peterson provides a substantial introduction to the book (some ten percent or so of the book’s text), in which he traces out his thesis in detail. He then divides the rest of the book into five discussions of pastoral work, grounding each in one of those “five scrolls.” In each, Peterson interacts with the psychologizing tendency of the present day, the history of the interpretation of the Biblical book in question, and how pastors might learn from and apply the lessons of the book to their own work in their own congregations. For Peterson, Song of Songs is a model for directing God’s people into richer prayer, Ruth is a picture of situating individual stories in the context of salvific history, Lamentations is a guide to walking with people through their suffering, Ecclesiastes is a help in rejecting false religion in place of the fear of God, and Esther is a pointer to the essentially communal nature of the people of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="analysis" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curiously, the most significant problem with the book might at first appear to be one of its great strengths. Peteron’s skill as a writer is such that he can sometimes carry the reader along by sheer rhetorical effect—but this is in some sense a result antithetical to the purpose of the text. In a text explicitly and self-consciously aiming to point pastors away from technique and the tendency to mistake emotion for changed lives, the contrast with what Peterson actually does in large swaths of the book is striking and unfortunate. There are too many places where Peterson relies on the emotional impact of his words rather than on the text itself. Nearly the whole chapter on Esther falls into this trap, as do large swaths of the chapters on Ecclesiastes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not so much that the points Peterson makes in these chapters are wrong: many of them are quite on target. It is that, disconnected from the text from which he purports to draw them, they become mere floating assertions about the world—assertions that, however beautifully made, we may take or leave as they strike us. There is too much technique in Peterson’s theologizing and too little of the Scripture to which he enjoins his readers to return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Granted that Peterson makes no claim to be writing exegetical commentaries on the text, but he opens the book with the reminder that “we don’t, and we must not, lay our own foundations” (p. 11). Indeed, he (quite rightly) spends the whole introduction pleading for pastors to ground their work not in the trends of the day but in the “eternal will and word of God” (p. 5). It is a strange thing that he should then spend so much of the book on his own ruminations and not wrestling with the particulars of those texts. This is a significant loss, because when Peterson does remain more closely engaged with the text, as in his chapters on Ruth and Lamentations, and as in some parts of his treatment of Ecclesiastes, the effect is marvelous. The reader is drawn into wonder at the way God’s word guides us effectively for pastoral ministry. The pastor is reminded that the circumstances and trials he and his flock face are not things newly sprung up in the late twentieth or early twenty-first century, but the sorts of things for which God has already supplied guides and instruction in the Scriptures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is no surprise: this is Peterson’s own thesis. The power of our faith, the fruitfulness of pastoral ministry (and the effectiveness of our books thereon) is not in our technique but in grappling deeply with the word of God in our own situations. The more he grapples with the Scriptures, the more his technique serves the text, the better Peterson’s book is—and vice versa. Where technique serves exposition, the reader is built up. Where exposition falls aside and rhetoric reigns, the reader may be moved emotionally, but little remains when that glow fades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, for four of the five chapters in the book, Peterson’s success in advancing his thesis may largely be measured by the extent to which he engages the text. In Ruth and Lamentations, the narrative and poetry respectively drive the discussion, and so the chapters are profoundly helpful. The discussion of Ruth helps the pastor see his peoples’ personal stories rightly—and thus, to help his people see their own stories rightly. They are not the end-all and be-all that modern psychology might make them out to be, but neither are they insignificant. Indeed, they are all the more significant precisely &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; they are part of something much bigger than themselves. The discussion of Lamentations helps a pastor to see the necessity both of walking &lt;em&gt;through&lt;/em&gt; suffering and sorrow with his flock and of helping them come to resolution in the right time. Petersons’ treatment of Ecclesiastes, as a guide to saying &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; to false religion, seems to be an accurate analysis of the book, but Peterson veers away from the Text. He deals too little with the specific ways in which &lt;em&gt;Qoheleth&lt;/em&gt; confronts our culture and too much in the sweeping generalizations about the value of those confrontations. Least helpful of all is his treatment of Esther, in which he rightly diagnoses severe problems in the culture around us but leaves aside almost everything in the book itself. We desperately need the kind of rebuke to individualism he suggests here. Whether Esther can support that kind of rebuke, still less offer an alternative vision of the people of God, is left aside in favor of a good but largely-unrelated discussion of Saul and Amalek and the shape of ministry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peterson’s treatment of the Song of Songs deserves its own analysis. The text is notoriously hard to interpret, and has been subject to countless different readings. Peterson falls squarely into the allegorical camp, though he gives the allegorical reading something of a twist. The urgency of romantic (both emotional and sexual) desire so prominent in the book he transmutes into a picture of the Christian’s right desire for communion with God. This was the chapter in which Peterson hewed &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; closely to the text, and so it was the chapter least susceptible to the problems outlined above. As with all treatments of the Song, though, the effectiveness of the chapter hinges on whether one finds Peterson’s interpretation accurate. (I did not.) Insofar as one grants Peterson’s interpretation, though, the chapter is an effective argument for the necessity of prayer, and especially of the pastor leading his people to pray with greater fervency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="conclusion" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Five Smooth Stones for Pastoral Work&lt;/em&gt; is in some ways a very good book, but in others it falls short—an especially unfortunate reality given the very real problems at which it aimed. That Peterson wants to see pastors grounding their &lt;em&gt;pastoring&lt;/em&gt; in the Scriptures as well as their preaching and teaching is clear. Less clear is whether this book will be as effective as it could have been in accomplishing that end. Good pastoral work does not run aground only on the rocks of psychology. Rhetoric is an equally deadly reef, and it may be the more tempting to a skilled writer passionate for the recovery of Biblical pastoral work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chapters on Ruth and Lamentations were excellent and profoundly helpful treatments of the topics they addressed, and Peterson’s treatment of Song of Songs was at least interesting. Because he exchanged exposition for effect in his treatments of Ecclesiastes and Esther, though, the book falters. Though his words never failed to pack an emotional punch, they were too often hollowed out by their lack of a connection to the text. In this, these chapters serve as an accidental and unfortunate illustration of the necessity of Peterson’s own thesis. We need not more effective psychology, nor more powerful lnaguage, but a deeper reliance on and connection to the word of God.&lt;/p&gt;

The declarative syntax and ability to define one’s own model in non-C++- or Python-specific ways is quite nice. That said, the learning process has had more than a few bumps along the way. I decided to go ahead and write those up as I go, both for my own reference and in the hope that it may prove useful to others as I go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;QML is a &lt;em&gt;Javascript-like&lt;/em&gt; language for &lt;em&gt;declarative programming&lt;/em&gt; of a user interface. So it’s a Javascript-based language that sort of behaves like HTML. In fact, it behaves like Javascript in terms of how you define, access, and update properties, and you can embed full-featured (mostly) Javascript functions and objects in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when you have nested QML Types, you end up with them behaving more like HTML.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weirdest bit, and the thing that I’m having the hardest time adjusting to, is that you can only edit properties of root Types when you’re working with an instance of that Type. And those Types are defined by &lt;em&gt;documents&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, to give the simplest possible example, let’s say I defined a new type called &lt;code&gt;Monkey&lt;/code&gt;, in the &lt;code&gt;Monkey.qml&lt;/code&gt; file, like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// Monkey.qml
import QtQuick 1.1

Item {
    id: monkey_root
    property int monkey_id: -1
    property string monkey_name: &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t have a name!&amp;quot;

    Item {
        id: monkey_foot
        property string monkey_foot_desc: &amp;quot;The monkey has a foot!&amp;quot;
    }
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can use that in another file. If they’re in the same directory, it’s automatically imported, so I can just do something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;//main.qml
import QtQuick 1.1

// Rectangle is exactly what it sounds like. Here we can display things.
Rectangle {
    id: the_basic_shape
    height: 400
    width: 400
    color: green

    Monkey {
        id: monkey_instance
        monkey_id = 42
        monkey_name = &amp;quot;George&amp;quot;  // he&amp;#39;s kind of a curious little guy
    }

    Text {
        text: monkey_instance.monkey_name
        color: &amp;quot;red&amp;quot;
    }
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That creates a (really ugly) rectangle that prints the &lt;code&gt;Monkey&lt;/code&gt;’s name in red text on a green background. It’s impossible to access directly the &lt;code&gt;monkey_foot&lt;/code&gt; element, though, which means that composing more complex objects in reusable ways is difficult. In fact, I haven’t come up with a particularly good way to do it yet. At least, I should say that I haven’t come up with a good way to create high-level reusable components yet. I can see pretty easily how to create low-level reusable components, but once you start putting them together in any &lt;em&gt;specific&lt;/em&gt; way, you can’t recompose them in other ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From what I’ve gotten my head around so far, this ends up being less flexible than either HTML templating languages (which are, or at least can be, completely declarative) or normal Javascript (which is obviously &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; declarative). Mind you, it’s all sorts of &lt;em&gt;interesting&lt;/em&gt;, and I have a pretty decent idea what I’m going to do to implement our UI with it, but it’s taken me most of the day to get a good handle on that, and my head still feels a bit funny whenever I’m trying to see how best to create composable components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note, too, that this is the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; way to create a new basic type of object in QML: it has to be the root level object in a QML document. I would &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; like to be able to access internal declarations—to have named internal types/objects. Unfortunately, QML doesn’t let you do this. I suspect this has to do with how the QML type system works: it actually binds these types to C++ objects behind the scenes. This is a non-trivially helpful decision in terms of the performance of the application, but it certainly makes my brain a little bit twitchy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two basic consequences of this structure. First, any types you need to be able to use in other QML objects have to be defined in their own QML documents. Second, it is (as near as I can see so far, at least) difficult to create good generic QML types of more complex structures that you can then use to implement specific variations. For example: if you want to create accordions, you can create a fair number of the low-level elements in generic ways that you can reuse, but once you get to the relationships between the actual model, delegate, and view elements, you will need to create them in custom forms for each distinct approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is more like creating HTML documents than Javascript, which makes sense, &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; you remember that QML is Javascript-based but &lt;em&gt;declarative&lt;/em&gt;. You just have to remember that while you can define some reusable components, the full-fledged elements are like full HTML pages with a templating system: you can include elements, but not override their internal contents. In QML, you can override &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; of their contents, which is nice—but that is not the primary way to go about it.&lt;/p&gt;

Though these gifts are certainly part of the recorded history of the Spirit’s work, the church’s focus thereupon (whether positive or negative) on the gifts has had the unfortunate side effect of hiding many of the other, arguably more central and essential actions of the Spirit in the life of the believer. Just as the Spirit is the person who mediates to us the work of Christ in our salvation and brings about our conversion, the Spirit is the one who leads us into greater participation in the renewed humanity the Son has accomplished in his incarnation, life, death, resurrection, and ascension. The Spirit is the one who progressively deepens our union with Christ and reshapes us to be like Him who saved us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Spirit accomplishes these ends in a variety of ways, all of which are themselves worthy of further reflection. First of all, it was the Spirit who superintended the writing of Scripture, the self-revelation of the Triune Godhead for our salvation and sanctification. If Christian formation is in no small measure a matter of growing to know our Creator—if we are being restored to active relationship with one who made us for that very relationship—then the ways in which our Creator has revealed himself are supremely important. Without Scripture, we would know little of God; through it we enter in the deep mysteries. The first part the Spirit plays in our formation, then, is in having guided every hand from Moses’ to John’s in the writing of the word of God. Upon this foundation comes the Spirit’s second work: opening our eyes to understand that Scripture. The things of God are foolishness to unregenerate people, but beautiful and savory to those who have been given spiritual life. The word of God can seem dense and opaque to those who do not believe, but every believer in Christ finds that more and more these mysteries unfold: this is the Spirit at work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we come to understand the person of God and the things he has commanded us in his word, we find that we are still weak and struggle to do them. Here, too, the Spirit is at work, for it is the Spirit who empowers our obedience. We know that the same Spirit that raised Christ from the dead is at work in us—and this is the only hope we have of overcoming sin and growing in holiness. Part and parcel of this, the Spirit empowers us to endure the suffering that God uses to make us more dependent on him and more faithful to him. Likewise, when in the course of our lives we are tempted to fall away, it is the Spirit who helps us continue to hold fast to the faith. Moreover, the Spirit intercedes for us when we do not know how to pray ourselves. When we are beset by temptation, when tempted to fall away, when exhausted from the battle, when wearied of the pursuit of holiness, the Spirit prays for us. Nor is the Spirit’s work directed solely to individuals. All of these realities are corporate, and in all of them we grow in unity and kindness toward one another. The Spirit is our bond of peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, then, we have both the Spirit and the Son praying for us to the Father who delights to answer those prayers, and the Spirit empowering us walk in the Son’s life with the Father—hallelujah!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week saw the premiere of Darren Aronofsky’s &lt;em&gt;Noah&lt;/em&gt;, and with it a (predictable) storm of controversy from the evangelical community. Reviews have ranged from &lt;a href="http://www.albertmohler.com/2014/03/31/drowning-in-distortion-darren-aronofskys-noah/"&gt;predictably critical&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/churchofthemasses/2014/03/the-utter-embarrassing-mess-of-noah-and-why-everybody-is-lying-about-it/"&gt;outright disdain&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://drbrianmattson.com/journal/2014/3/31/sympathy-for-the-devil"&gt;hostile readings&lt;/a&gt;, and from &lt;a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2014/march-web-only/noah.html?paging=off"&gt;strongly (though not unreservedly) positive&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://convergemagazine.com/noah-film-12561/"&gt;more restrained restrained affirmation&lt;/a&gt; of the film on &lt;a href="http://www.relevantmagazine.com/culture/film/noah"&gt;aesthetic and spiritual&lt;/a&gt; grounds to especially measured &lt;a href="http://www.catholicworldreport.com/Item/3036/inoahi_a_theological_reflection.aspx"&gt;theological&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://christandpopculture.com/stars-strange-review-noah/"&gt;artistic engagement&lt;/a&gt;. In short, the responses spanned exactly the range one would expect from the evangelical community, which is itself deeply divided on the purpose, value, and meaning of the arts—decades of conversation on the topic notwithstanding. &lt;em&gt;Noah&lt;/em&gt; works as a sort of theological-artistic Rorschach test. We seem to find it in what we expect given its origins and our disposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than offer another review (which would add nothing to the conversation at this point), or decry once again the predictable evangelical response to the arts, or even critique reviews with which I disagreed, I thought it might be useful instead to ask where we stand today and point to a few places we might grow from this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think you’ll find &lt;a href="http://mereorthodoxy.com/noah-theological-aesthetic-rorschach-test/"&gt;the rest of the piece&lt;/a&gt; salient and helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

It shows the influence of patristic thought in the best way possible, and also demonstrates a great handle on the bigger picture of salvation history in the whole of the canon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few salient quotes. First, on moral and physical perfection:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perfection was not the creation’s natural state, but its intended destiny (and salvation is not a ‘rebooting’ of creation to its primary state, but the restoring of creation to the future that God originally intended for it)….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With perfection, our wills will be so capable of apprehending our good that we will no longer be capable of willing to do evil, not by virtue of some external compulsion, but by virtue of mature wills and natures and their appropriate mutual correspondence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then from the conclusion, which I positively &lt;em&gt;loved&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, Christ’s obedience is not about ‘innocence’ but about ‘perfection’. Christ brings humanity to the height and fullness of its divinely intended moral stature. He gives us, not merely innocence or obedience, but full maturity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, humanity was always intended to die and rise again to a more glorious form of life. Christ death and resurrection achieves this destiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, as the last Adam, Christ will pacify and tame the entire creation, ruling until every enemy is placed under his feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth, as we are in Christ, the bad character of death is minimized. We are not unclothed to be left naked, but in order to be more fully clothed, to have death swallowed up in life. We are still subject to the hostile attacks of the world and to the possibility of death within it, but Christ is the Tree of Life and we have unrestricted access to him. Death is no longer the alienating power that it once was.&lt;/p&gt;

Jaimie and I have been memorizing Colossians this spring, and we will have finished the book by the end of April, Lord willing. I read through the book this morning, and found great joy in that I can see the contours of Paul’s letter much more clearly and understand the book much more deeply. Even more, though, I am extremely glad for the ways I can see that the book is shaping me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several days last week, I woke up with various verses from the book echoing in my mind—Col. 1:23’s encouragement to hold fast to the faith, Col. 1:15–19’s magnificent and beautiful Christology, Col. 2:20–23’s admonition to lean on Christ and not on worldly asceticism, Col. 1:29’s picture of Paul’s hard work for the sake of the gospel… It is difficult to overstate the impact it has on one’s life to have a book like this constantly ringing in one’s mind. Its contents are now always ready to be drawn upon as I encounter opportunities and trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colossians’ sweep from the doctrine of Christ and salvation to our eminently practicable response is typical of Paul, and reminds me that we cannot ever separate the two. When the book enjoins men like me, “Husbands, love your wives, and do not be harsh with them… Fathers, do not provoke your children, lest they become discouraged” (Col. 3:19,21), this is entirely dependent on the reality that I have been raised with Christ and know that I will appear with him in glory when he returns (Col. 3:1–4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My ethical response (Col. 3:5–4:2) finds its foundation in the assurance of what God &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; done and the hope of what he &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; do. My ability to carry out that response is wholly based on my unity with Christ: that in him spiritually I died and have been raised (cf. Col. 2:20, 3:1). He is my life (Col 3:4). There is no separating our obedience, our pursuit of holiness, from his gracious work on our behalf. He did and does and will do, and we respond. Neither can we fail to respond and say that we are truly in Christ nor perform moral acts of any worth if we reject Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And daily I find myself meditating on and turning to these realities and commands. I am led to worship, and led to obedience. Praise God for Colossians, for his command to know his word by heart.&lt;/p&gt;

I was watching some friends’ little girl, who is not yet a Christ-follower, and our discussion ranged all over. We talked about everything from the bush- climbing groundhog who appeared out the back door midway through our conversation to the reason for the “blood” langauge throughout the Bible (“Eww! Blood is disgusting!”), and from what happened in the Incarnation and the nature of the Trinity to how hard it is to obey one’s parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conversation highlighted for me the necessity of learning theology. These kinds of questions will come up in any family whose parents are seeking to point their children to Jesus. The Bible has a lot of initially perplexing material in it. Many of its concepts are foreign to &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; culture by dint of antiquity and sociological differences between the ancient Hebrews and Greeks and modern Westerners. Others are foreign to &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; cultures because of the Fall, and require all of us to undergo the transformation that occurs in the renewal of our minds as the Spirit sanctifies us. No surprise, then, that a seven-year-old would be asking questions about these things: they are hard and confusing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is a surprise to me is how often I have heard these topics brushed aside as inessential or secondary. The Trinity? Too complicated for ordinary folks. The Incarnation? Just kind of a thing that had to happen so Jesus could die for us. The blood language? Well, that’s mostly just the Old Testament anyway. The really important bits are that we tell people about Jesus and live basically right!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the obvious questions are who this Jesus is and what it means to “live right,” and to answer these questions &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt; we have to deal in some rather deep theological concerns. To live right is to live in accord with the way of God in the world he made—but who is God, and how did he shape the cosmos? As for the person of Jesus, any answer at all that wrestles with the text of the Bible must soon confront both the ideas of the Trinity and the Incarnation in short order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s just for talking to a seven-year-old!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish that the picture I presented above were a caricature, an over- simplification of more nuanced positions designed to make a rhetorical point with some flourish, but it is not. In the Baptistic circles in which I travel, there are &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; churches with explicitly anti-doctrinal stances. To be sure, we have our share of churches that focus on doctrine to the exclusion of right practice, but these are much less common in low-church contexts than their opposite. “Doctrine divides,” and we want “deeds not creeds,” and that is all there is to it—only it cannot be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As has often been said, the question is not whether we are theologians, but what sort of theologians we will be. All of us have our own understandings of God, and these ideas are more or less in line with what Scripture says. Because God is truly great, his revelation of himself pushes us to &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt;. We refuse to engage our critical faculties at our own peril.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not for a moment suggesting that my own particular brand of nerdiness ought to be the standard by which Christians are judged. I am, however, deeply and increasingly persuaded that a failure to think seriously about the contents of our faith will result only in ruin and calamity in our people. We need blue- collar men and women no less than erudite scholars to be comfortable explaining the Trinity to their children and coworkers. We need not all be intellectual sophisticates (Lord help us if we were), but we do all need to be a people shaped by the intellectual depths of our faith. We need to be able to explain our faith both so that we may teach outsiders and so that we may build one another up and guard one another in the faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to be able to tell our seven-year-olds how it is that God became man and why that would even matter. We need to understand ourselves how the one who was totally pure became “disgusting” on our behalf in order to undo the brokenness our rebellion introduced so we can tell that story to our children. We need to grasp that the Trinity is not an ancillary doctrine to our faith, but one of its bedrock affirmations, so that we can proclaim to our children and our neighbors the God who is unending love within his own being—they will need this to make sense of any of the other things we say about Jesus. And this I say not in some abstract sense, but because I needed to be able to talk about all of those to help my friends’ little girl make a little more sense of the gospel &lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

It was slow going. The tool is decent, but the documentation is spotty and it felt like everything was just a bit of a slog—to get it working correctly, to get it playing nicely with other pieces of the development puzzle, to get it working across platforms.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Then, because I had done something a &lt;em&gt;little&lt;/em&gt; bit silly in my eagerness to get up and going last week and written code without a testable configuration, I hit a wall today. The queries weren’t working. I had made a &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22865573/sqlalchemy-successful-insertion-but-then-raises-an-exception"&gt;bug&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent a substantial part of the day chasing down that bug, and then a conversation with user &lt;em&gt;agronholm&lt;/em&gt; on the &lt;a href="http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/rel_0_9/"&gt;SQLAlchemy&lt;/a&gt; IRC channel (&lt;a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/sqlalchemy"&gt;freenode/#sqlalchemy&lt;/a&gt;) got me thinking. The Firebird team describes one of their options as an “embedded” server, but &lt;em&gt;agronholm&lt;/em&gt; pointed out that what they really mean is &lt;em&gt;portable&lt;/em&gt;. It’s running a standalone server and client, but it’s not part of the same thread/process (like SQLite is). Then &lt;em&gt;agronholm&lt;/em&gt; very helpfully asked—my having mentioned my preference for &lt;a href="http://www.postgresql.org"&gt;PostgreSQL&lt;/a&gt; earlier—“Does Postgres not have a portable version?” Two minutes later, we had both found &lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/postgresqlportable/"&gt;PostgreSQL Portable&lt;/a&gt;, and I rejoiced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me less than half an hour to get it downloaded and set up and to confirm that it would work the way we need for this particular piece of software. (Firebird had taken me a good three hours, what with digging through badly organized and not terribly clear documentation.) It took me less than half an hour more to get PostgreSQL to the same point that I’d finally gotten Firebird to after multiple hours working with it. And I was so &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; happy. What had been an especially frustrating work day now had me quietly smiling to myself constantly for the last two and a half hours as I &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22865573/sqlalchemy-successful-insertion-but-then-raises-an-exception/22872598#22872598"&gt;finished&lt;/a&gt; tracking down the bug that had set me on this path in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several years ago, when I first started doing web development, I got my feet wet in database work with MySQL—probably the single most common starting point for anyone going that route, courtesy of the ubiquity of the standard Linux-Apache- MySQL-PHP stack.&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; A year after that, I picked up some work that was already using PostgreSQL and fell in love almost immediately.&lt;a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Something just felt &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; about running &lt;code&gt;psql&lt;/code&gt; than running &lt;code&gt;mysql&lt;/code&gt; on the command line. Postgres’ implementation of the SQL standard felt more natural. Even the tiniest little details like the way tables display when you query them in &lt;code&gt;psql&lt;/code&gt; was nicer. In less than a week, I was sold and haven’t looked back. While I’ve used MySQL out of convenience on shared hosting from time to time, PostgreSQL is unquestionably my preferred database target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today’s experience brought that all home again. That grin on my face all afternoon felt a bit silly, but it highlights the difference that really good software design makes. I am not just talking about how it looks here—though, to be sure, PostgreSQL is prettier than FirebirdSQL—but how it works. PostgreSQL feels responsive, its command set makes a lot of sense and is easy to use, and it is &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; well documented. In fact, I would go so far as to say that it is the best documented open source software I have ever used, as well as among the very most robust. (The only other open source software I find to be as incredibly rock-solid and reliable as PostgreSQL is the Linux kernel. I am by no means an expert on either, or on open source software in general, but the Linux kernel is an unarguably amazing piece of work. So is PostgreSQL.) All those tiny little details add up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a good reminder for me as I write software that yes, the things I care about—the small matters that would be so easy to overlook when customers express no interest in them—really do matter. People may not know that things like typography make a difference in their experience, but those subtle, often imperceptible things matter. They may not consciously notice the differences in your interface design (even a command line interface), but it will change their experience of the software. Do it poorly, or even in a just-good-enough-to-get- by fashion, and you’ll annoy or simply bore them. Do it well, and you might just delight them—even if they can’t tell you why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;section id="examples" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Examples&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make my point a little more visible, I thought it might be useful to post samples of SQL to accomplish the same task in the two different database dialects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="firebirdsql4" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;FirebirdSQL:&lt;a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;CREATE TABLE projects (
  id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  title VARCHAR(32) NOT NULL,
  file_name VARCHAR(32) NOT NULL,
  file_location VARCHAR(256) NOT NULL,
  CONSTRAINT unique_file UNIQUE (file_name, file_location)
);
CREATE SEQUENCE project_id_sequence;
SET TERM + ;
CREATE TRIGGER project_id_sequence_update
  ACTIVE BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE POSITION 0
  ON projects
AS
BEGIN
  IF ((new.id IS NULL) OR (new.id = 0))
    THEN new.id = NEXT VALUE FOR project_id_sequence;
END+
SET TERM ; +&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="postgresql" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;PostgreSQL&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;CREATE TABLE projects (
  id SERIAL NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  title VARCHAR(32) NOT NULL,
  file_name VARCHAR(32) NOT NULL,
  file_location VARCHAR(256) NOT NULL,
  CONSTRAINT unique_file UNIQUE (file_name, file_location)
);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not just that the PostgreSQL example is shorter and clearer—it is that it is shorter and clearer because its designers and developers have taken the time to make sure that the shorter, cleaner way works well, and have documented it so you can know how to use that shorter cleaner way without too much difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="refs" class="references"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section class="footnotes"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I do most of my development on a Mac, but do all the testing on the target platform (Windows) in a VM.&lt;a href="#fnref1"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, I would only use one of those by default if I were building a web app: Linux. I’d use &lt;a href="http://wiki.nginx.org/Main"&gt;nginx&lt;/a&gt; instead of Apache, &lt;a href="http://www.postgresql.org"&gt;PostgreSQL&lt;/a&gt; instead of MySQL, and &lt;a href="https://www.python.org"&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt; (though &lt;a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/"&gt;Ruby&lt;/a&gt;, Javascript via &lt;a href="http://nodejs.org"&gt;node.js&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/hh341490"&gt;C# and the .NET stack&lt;/a&gt;, or just about anything &lt;em&gt;but&lt;/em&gt; PHP would do fine).&lt;a href="#fnref2"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn3"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Almost&lt;/em&gt; immediately because at that point configuration on OS X was a bit of a pain. That is &lt;a href="http://postgresapp.com" title="Postgres.app"&gt;no longer the case&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a href="#fnref3"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn4"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be perfectly fair to Firebird, it is improving. The upcoming 3.0 series release will make these two a lot more similar than they are at present, and clean up a number of other issues. What it won’t do is get the &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; of using Firebird more like that of using Postgres, or make the installation procedure smoother or easier, or make the documentation more complete.&lt;a href="#fnref4"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

It is the Spirit who regenerates a person, indwells him, and seals him for the day of salvation. The spirit makes the gospel powerfully effective for salvation so that those who hear it may believe and be saved. On these points all are agreed, since they are backed by straightforward statements in Scripture. The particulars, however, are a matter of some controversy, and so bear further consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two broad views of the Spirit’s work in regeneration. In the non- Calvinist view (whether Arminian, Roman Catholic, or variations thereon in other streams of Christian tradition), the Spirit does preparatory work in the hearts of the unregenerate and provides God’s grace to enable people to choose whether to respond to the gospel or not. However it is articulated (most commonly as “prevenient grace” in Baptist circles), this view emphasizes that the Spirit’s work is essential in making available the effects of Christ’s work on the cross to whomever will believe. Without the Spirit’s work, regeneration through faith is impossible, because no one will believe. With the Spirit’s work, men are enabled to choose freely whether to follow God or no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Calvinist view, by contrast, the Spirit not only works in a preparatory sense, but is also the active agent in bringing about conversion. People choose as they will, and people dead in their trespasses always choose sin over God—this is the essence of our fallen nature. What is needed, in this view, is not only the grace-given ability to choose (as in a prevenient grace view) but a grace-changed heart so that we will freely choose God. No matter how free our choice, unless the effects of original sin in us are undone, we continue freely to choose sin and to reject God. The Spirit, then, takes away hearts of stone and gives instead beating hearts of flesh that can respond to God. He gives eyes to see the light he shines as well as the light itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The essential disagreement between the two views is to whom the Spirit gives such eyes: to all men who hear the gospel, or only to the elect. Based on Paul’s arguments in 1 Corinthians, Ephesians, and elsewhere, I take it to be the latter. If the Spirit opened everyone’s eyes to see truly the goodness of God, if he gave to everyone hearts of flesh rather than hearts of stone all would believe. Regeneration logically precedes (but temporally coincides with) faith: the unregenerate heart cannot and does not believe. So the Spirit gives hearts that can and do believe, and in that very moment, we believe. The Spirit gives us not only the opportunity to exercise faith, but also the faith that we exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However the act of regeneration is accomplished, the Spirit is efficaciously at work. In both views, the gospel &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; powerful for salvation—whether by tilling the soil or by actually causing the seed to sprout. People hear the gospel and the Spirit uses that mightily. Then, once people have believed, the Holy Spirit continues to work. He immediately indwells the believer, giving our mortal bodies spiritual vitality. Thus Paul says that the same Spirit who raised Christ from the dead is now at work in all believers. This indwelling seals our conversion, ensuring we hold fast until we die or Christ returns. He increasingly shapes our behaviors and attitudes to be more in line with those of God, making us holy as God is holy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, the Spirit is the one who makes Christ’s work effective for salvation. He enables and empowers the gospel to produce conversion.&lt;/p&gt;

Today, for example, I read from 2 Corinthians (mid first century A.D.), Proverbs (written early in the 10th century B.C. and mostly likely compiled into its final form sometime around the 6th century B.C.), and Psalms (similar to Proverbs, perhaps in this particular case with a slightly earlier date of composition and later date of completion). In other words, I am reading a words penned anywhere from about 3,000 to about 2,000 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About twenty years separate me from my father, and he from his. A “generation” is something like twenty to twenty-five years. Call it twenty-five for good measure. Then it has been between 80 and 120 human lives since these books were written. That distance in time is almost unfathomable.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; And yet we have the audacity to say the Paul’s letters, Solomon’s proverbs, and David’s poetry have something to say to us today. More than that, we claim that God expressly intended that we read these books as his revelation of himself to us &lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt;. Not, to be sure, in the sense that we act as if 2 Corinthians is a letter addressed to us (though I have heard this articulation bandied around in simplistic fashion, usually in the context of trying to motivate people into reading their Bibles) but in the sense that God’s work in &lt;em&gt;those&lt;/em&gt; people’s lives at &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; time was recorded in such a way as to be a comprehensible revelation of the character and desires of the living God whom we serve &lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are not without warrant in making this claim. Those intervening centuries have seen the church flourish and grow under the guidance of the Scriptures, and never more so than when listening most carefully to the ways God has revealed himself in the Scriptures themselves. New light is &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; shining forth into the church from these ancient pages, because the Spirit of God is always at work using these old words to confront new people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two realities here: a lesser and a greater one. The lesser is that people have not changed. Many of the particulars of our circumstances have, of course. I read these words from a tablet this morning, and I am typing on a laptop—a pair of devices that certainly would have astounded anyone in the original audiences. Modernity is extraordinarily different from all that preceded it &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; ways. But these are mere externals; the human heart is the same as it has ever been. We are still troubled, broken, rebels against the King of the universe, desperately in need of salvation from both the guilt and the power of sin in our lives and of reconciliation with our maker and with each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The greater reality is that God has not changed, and it is the Holy Spirit that makes these vintage texts work life among us. The same God who put his breath in man put his breath in these texts&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; He breathes through them into the life of his people today, so that what was said then means something now. This is miraculous on many levels: that the words penned then were able to be profitable for so long, that they were so well preserved, and that we are enabled to hear them. The work of the Spirit is often reduced to his visibly and obviously miraculous doings—healings, tongues, etc.—but I think this is one of the greatest works done at the Spirit’s hand. This reality leads us to worship, as it should, and as it is meant to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we write out all the greats in the chain back to my ancestors who lived when these words were being written, the &lt;em&gt;shorter&lt;/em&gt; version comes to this: roughly my great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-grandparents were walking around then.&lt;a href="#fnref1"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We translate from the Greek &lt;em&gt;theopneustos&lt;/em&gt; to “inspired” because the Authorized Version did—but “God-breathed” would be equally accurate. That is exactly what “inspired by God” meant when King James was alive: to be “inspired” is simply to be breathed into, from Latin &lt;em&gt;in-&lt;/em&gt; (‘in/into’) + &lt;em&gt;spirare&lt;/em&gt; (‘breathe’).&lt;a href="#fnref2"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Psalm, we see David (quite rightly) walking the line we all so often walk between complaint and praise. He calls out to God for help and deliverance and points out the unjust nature of their attack on him. He repeatedly points to God’s character and pleads for justice. He calls on God to act in line with his steadfast love and his mercy (Ps. 69:16), because it was for God that David suffered. And he praises God for his goodness, even though the structure of the poem seems to leave David still in his suffering. The conclusion of the psalm is the turn from “But I am afflicted and in pain; / let your salvation, O God, set me on high!” (Ps. 69:29) to “I will praise the name of God with a song…” (Ps. 69:30)—not, it seems, because God &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; delivered but because David trusted that he &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, in 2 Corinthians Paul repeatedly emphasizes the extent to which suffering characterized his ministry and indeed dominated his life. These passages are some of the dearest in the New Testament to believers suffering for the sake of Christ, because they deal truly and honestly with the pain, but also deal in hope. God shone light in our hearts, Paul rejoices, but we have his treasure in earthen vessels that are “afflicted in every way” and which are “always carrying in the body the death of Jesus” (2 Cor. 4:6,7–12). Paul can see the purpose of this suffering clearly—it is that the Corinthians and all the other believers will have the life of Jesus (2 Cor. 4:11)—but this does not for a moment diminish the reality of the suffering he and his companions endured. Nor does Paul feel the need to diminish his sufferings in order to point to God’s goodness; quite the contrary, in fact! In chapter 6, he goes on to describe at length all the &lt;em&gt;kinds&lt;/em&gt; of suffering he had endured for the sake of the gospel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who, like David and Paul, hope in Yahweh and seek to do his will, there will be suffering. Those who preach the gospel will find rejection, pain, and toil everywhere. Even ordinary believers—those of us less outsized in our endeavors than the Davids and Pauls of the story—will find in our lives suffering that pushes us to decide how we will answer. Will we follow David’s example and conclude our lament and our pleading with praise (Ps. 69:30–36)? Will we follow Paul’s example and hold fast to the hope of an “eternal weight of glory” (2 Cor. 4:17–18) being prepared for us? Will we refuse to diminish the extent of our suffering but also refuse to let our suffering diminish God? Or will we take the easy paths out: to make little of the pains of the age on the one hand (quite dishonestly) or to refuse to praise God because we experience suffering (blasphemously)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The call, for all of us, is to look the sufferings of the present age head on, to recognize them in all their horror, and to call God greater still. Not to pretend the sufferings are small things, but to see that they are “light and momentary” (2 Cor. 4:17) by comparison with what God is doing &lt;em&gt;eternally&lt;/em&gt;. Not to act as those the situations in our lives do not pain us our trouble us, but to call God good and to lead others to worship him &lt;em&gt;anyway&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of my thinking here is shaped quite actively by Eugene Peterson’s &lt;em&gt;Five Smooth Stones for Pastoral Work&lt;/em&gt;, especially the chapter on Lamentations. The volume is well worth your time.&lt;a href="#fnref1"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

This month will be my third time through the book this year, since I have been reading it start to finish each month (save February, where I read through some of the other Wisdom literature). I had not spent much time with the Proverbs over the past few years, in part because I had struggled to and not known how to integrate them with the broader flow of the Scriptures. Several things persuaded me to integrate them into my daily reading this year. First of all, this is the word of God! All of it is profitable for us—enough said. Second, as I have walked further into adulthood, I have increasingly recognized the need for wisdom, whether in my own life or in caring for other believers. The world is a hard and complicated place this side of the New Jerusalem, and it is only by having deep, sound, Godly wisdom that we can walk it well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book tells us its purpose from the outset:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To know wisdom and instruction,&lt;br /&gt;
    to understand words of insight,&lt;br /&gt;
to receive instruction in wise dealing,&lt;br /&gt;
    in righteousness, justice, and equity;&lt;br /&gt;
to give prudence to the simple,&lt;br /&gt;
    knowledge and discretion to the youth—&lt;br /&gt;
Let the wise hear and increase in learning,&lt;br /&gt;
    and the one who understands obtain guidance,&lt;br /&gt;
to understand a proverb and a saying,&lt;br /&gt;
    the words of the wise and their riddles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="citation"&gt;
—Proverbs 1:2–6
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then it tells us how this will all be accomplished:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fear of the &lt;span class="smcp"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; is the beginning of knowledge;&lt;br /&gt;
    fools despise wisdom and instruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="citation"&gt;
—Proverbs 1:7
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here I am again, being reminded that “the fear of Yahweh is the beginning of knowledge; fools despise wisdom and instruction.” (In some sense, that made me bordering on a fool for several years as I skipped over this simply because I did not understand it. Shouldn’t the response be exactly the opposite?) If I want to understand mysteries and riddles, to understand proverbs and sayings, to receiving instruction in wise dealing, righteousness, justice, and equity, to become prudent and knowledgeable and wise, to increase in learning, to obtain guidance—and who would not want these things?—then I start by fearing Yahweh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Situated against the backdrop of the canon, this opening is all the more compelling. It is not fear of God generically that is the beginning of wisdom, nor even knowledge that there is a creator. It is personal knowledge of the &lt;span class="smcp"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, of &lt;em&gt;Yahweh&lt;/em&gt;, the covenant God of Israel. This cannot be separated from knowing who Yahweh is as he is revealed in the rest of Scripture. Yet if I am truly to grow in knowledge and understanding of righteousness—one of the chief topics of the Bible!—then I must come time and again to these words, and seek wisdom. I must time and again humble myself before our Creator-Savior-God and recognize that my own wisdom and the wisdom of the world around me is ultimately bankrupt. I have nothing to teach God; from him I have everything to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it can only be learned in that posture of humility before transcendent wisdom that surpasses human understanding. That is the lesson of &lt;em&gt;Qoheleth&lt;/em&gt; (Ecclesiastes): as we turn and begin to seek wisdom on our own, we will increasingly fall into folly. No wonder, then, that immediately following the invitation to be wise here in Proverbs 1, in Lady Wisdom’s first monologue, comes a rebuke and a warning to fools and simpletons who do not seek true wisdom. It is an easy enough course to take—the easiest, the most natural for us as fallen people—but it is deadly. There is a cost when I fail to fear Yahweh and keep his ways.&lt;/p&gt;

And this proclamation of the gospel centers on the &lt;em&gt;risen&lt;/em&gt; Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every since reading N. T. Wright’s magnificent &lt;a href="http://www.christianbook.com/Christian/Books/product?event=AFF&amp;amp;p=1179430&amp;amp;item_no=26794"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Resurrection of the Son of God&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a few years ago, I have become increasingly aware of the way that the resurrection pervades the New Testament. As evangelicals, we are mostly a crucicentric people, focused quite &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/the-atonement-leon-morris.html"&gt;narrowly and specifically&lt;/a&gt; on the atoning work of Jesus on the cross. This is good, to an extent: if we &lt;em&gt;lose&lt;/em&gt; the atonement, we have lost the gospel. On the other hand, I am ever more aware, as I listen to sermon after sermon, that we simply do not preach the resurrection of Christ enough. Certainly, we do not follow closely the example of the church in Acts and the apostles in their writings, where the resurrection is always front and center, and where as Paul puts it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain and your faith is in vain. We are even found to be misrepresenting God, because we testified about God that he raised Christ, whom he did not raise if it is true that the dead are not raised. For if the dead are not raised, not even Christ has been raised. And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile and you are still in your sins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—1 Corinthians 15:14–17 ESV&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over and over again, Paul hammers home the reality that we are saved from our sins—we are justified—by the resurrection of Christ no less than by his death (cf. Romans 4:25). Indeed, with his death alone we would be lost, trapped, dead just as we were before his coming. But with his resurrection we participate in the life of the Godhead. He has died the death we ought to die, and in this we rejoice. But we rejoice all the more that he is the firstfruits of the final triumph over both sin and death in the resurrection from the dead. In Jesus we do not have merely an exemplary martyr for the cause of right living—we have a risen Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul in 1 Corinthians 15 refuses to let us take the death of Christ as sufficient on its own. He refuses to let us think that things end when we die. He refuses to let people embrace a view of life that ends with the here and now. As ever, he points to eschatalogical&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; hope. The bodies we inhabit will be made new—not replaced, but transformed into something glorious. We walk in the light of the age to come, in the world which with us groans for redemption but not for a moment believing that the here-and-now is all there is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a side note, can we please stop saying this like “scatalogical” with an ‘e’ tacked onto the front? The ‘e’ gets the emphasis, just as it does in “eschaton”, and the ‘a’ sounds roughly like “uh” (or if you want to sound precise, “ah”).&lt;a href="#fnref1"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Today’s reading in 1 Corinthians brought that home to me in a very real way. In the middle of 1 Corinthians 11, Paul comments that the reason that some of the Corinthians had become ill and others had even died was because they had been taking communion in a manner unworthy of Christ (1 Cor. 11:30). Just after reading it, I thought something like, &lt;em&gt;Paul is just spiritualizing, because that’s not really what happened.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then I stopped, rather shocked by the thought that had just run through my head. What Paul asserts is &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; what happened; to say it was otherwise is flatly to deny the inerrancy and authority of Scripture. I am not for an uncareful doctrine of inerrancy any more than were those who carefully articulated it for in the latter part of the 19th century. I am all for a thorough doctrine of inerrancy, and I think we lose a great deal the moment we begin to think ourselves wiser than the Spirit of God who superintended the writing of the Scriptures. So I had opportunity immediately to repent and to submit my mind again to what God says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Were there many things Paul did not know about how illness worked? Yes. But whatever the means of God’s effecting those Corinthian believers’ illnesses and deaths, they were nonetheless the judgment of our all-powerful God on his church so that we would know that he requires us to regard highly the sacraments he instituted. Whenever we find ourselves in a place where our minds butt up against the clear teaching of Scripture, we need to be willing to change our minds, plain and simple. We submit to Scripture; we do not require that Scripture submit to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the contrast between my two separate times of personal reflection on the nature of the word of God today could not be starker. There, in my devotional reading, I was second-guessing Paul and the Spirit of God. Later in the day, as I worked on a short reflection paper (to be published in late April after it is due in class), I spent a substantial section of the paper focusing on the Spirit’s work of preparing the Scriptures and opening our eyes to see them. There, I was led to grateful worship in awe of what the Helper whom the Father sent us has done on our behalf so that we might see God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a matter of just a few hours between these two radically different encounters with the authority of Scripture. A few hours and a lot of much-needed repentance and much-needed grace from the Spirit to open my eyes and transform my understanding so that I could see the Holy One’s revelation and worship instead of seize up with skepticism. May it be so more and more in my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The short story is the pastoral form for narrating &lt;em&gt;Heilsgeschichte&lt;/em&gt; (salvation history) in the vocabulary of &lt;em&gt;Seelsgeschichte&lt;/em&gt; (soul history). In the &lt;em&gt;Heilsgeschichte&lt;/em&gt; of Judges, for instance, the enmity of the Midianiites is kerygmatically integrated into the historical narrative and shown to be a part of salvation; in the &lt;em&gt;Seelsgeschichte&lt;/em&gt; of Ruth the bitter emptiness of Naomi is pastorally attended to under the dynamics of providence and guided to a concluding fullness. In the &lt;em&gt;Heilsgeschichte&lt;/em&gt; of Exodus the formidable and unyielding Egyptians are judged and defeated in the catastrophic plagues and miraculous sea crossing; in the &lt;em&gt;Seelsgeschichte&lt;/em&gt; of Ruth the everday ordinariness of gleaning in the barley fields is used as a means for accomplishing redemption. In the &lt;em&gt;Heilsgeschichte&lt;/em&gt; of Joshua the gigantically walled fortress Jericho is surrounded and conquered by the total community of God in colorful parade, accompanied by brilliantly sounding trumpets, and the promised land is entered; in the &lt;em&gt;Seelsgeschichte&lt;/em&gt; of Ruth an old levirate law is patiently and quietly worked through by some old men at the city gates of provincial Bethlehem, and a link is forged in the genealogical chain of the Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These setup tools &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be applicable to any of JetBrains’ other Java-based IDEs which include database support (e.g. PyCharm, RubyMine, WebStorm, etc.). &lt;em&gt;Note:&lt;/em&gt; the following apply to IntelliJ IDEA 12 and the associated platforms, but &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to the IDEA 13 platform, which made substantial changes to how databases are configured. The underlying details are consistent, but the interface has changed. I have tested on PyCharm 3.1 to confirm that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was all done on OS X 10.9, so I also make no guarantees that this works on other platforms, though the likelihood that it behaves the same on Linux is fairly good. I will update the post if and when I have confirmed that it does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steps to configuring a database correctly for use with IDEA/etc. Note that steps 1–3 are fairly obvious; the real point of interest is in steps 4 and 5, which took me the longest time to figure out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Download the latest version of the Firebird &lt;a href="http://www.firebirdsql.org/en/jdbc-driver/"&gt;Java drivers&lt;/a&gt; for your operating system and your Java version. (You can check your Java version by running &lt;code&gt;java -version&lt;/code&gt; at the command line.) Extract the downloaded zip file. The extracted folder should include a file named &lt;code&gt;jaybird-full-&amp;lt;version&amp;gt;.jar&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;version&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is currently 2.2.4).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In IDEA, in the database view, add a new data source: in the Database view (accessible via a menu button on the right side of the screen), right click and choose &lt;strong&gt;New -&amp;gt; Data Source&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under &lt;strong&gt;JDBC driver files&lt;/strong&gt;, browse to the location where you extracted the Jaybird driver files and select &lt;code&gt;jaybird-full-&amp;lt;version&amp;gt;.jar&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under &lt;strong&gt;JDBC driver class&lt;/strong&gt;, choose &lt;code&gt;org.firebirdsql.jdbc.FBDriver&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under &lt;strong&gt;Database URL&lt;/strong&gt;, specify &lt;code&gt;jdbc:firebirdsql://localhost:3050/&lt;/code&gt; followed by &lt;em&gt;either&lt;/em&gt; the full path to the database in question or a corresponding alias.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; A full path might look like this on Windows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;jdbc:firebirdsql://localhost:3050/C:/my_project/the_database.db&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With an alias, you would instead have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;jdbc:firebirdsql://localhost:3050/the_alias&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then specify valid values for the &lt;strong&gt;User&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Password&lt;/strong&gt; fields from your existing configuration of the database.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click the &lt;strong&gt;Test Connection&lt;/strong&gt; button and make sure the configuration works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That should do it. Note that the driver choice and path configuration both matter. On OS X, I found that only the &lt;code&gt;FBDriver&lt;/code&gt; with this (and one other, older-style and therefore not recommended) path setup worked successfully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I strongly recommend configuring an alias in the aliases.conf file in the Firebird home directory (usually set as &lt;code&gt;$FIREBIRD_HOME&lt;/code&gt; during installation on *nix systems). This lets you move the database around at will, update just the configuration file, and not have to update any references to the database file whatsoever.&lt;a href="#fnref1"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

The psalm opens with a declaration of God’s worthiness of praise and a statement of his atonement&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and righteousness on behalf of his saints, then moves to a depiction of his power in creation. For some reason, I expected the Psalmist to move the other direction if he were going to bring these two things together in a single Psalm. Perhaps it is the way we often tell the story in explaining the gospel—creation, fall, redemption, restoration—but moving from salvation from sins and reconciliation with God to creation caught me off guard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So often, I fall into a bad habit of separating the attributes of God—as though God were a collection of properties and not &lt;em&gt;persons&lt;/em&gt; who all share in the same nature. We cannot separate his creative nature from his saving love for us any more than we can separate the same kinds of things in ourselves. Do I write poetry for my wife because I am creative,&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or because I am loving? Both, of course: any split between the two is a false disjunction. When I write her a poem, I am drawing on multiple facets of my personality and exercising multiple faculties and bending my will to accomplish one end &lt;em&gt;through&lt;/em&gt; another end. One can write poetry for its own sake, and one can love one’s wife without poetry, and one can write poetry for one’s wife. Bringing the two together is no strange thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it is with God, and so this psalm reminds us. God creates because he is creative, and also he creates because of his love for his creatures. He delighted to make a good world for us. In creation he demonstrates his power and his wisdom, and in creation he also demonstrates his deep and abiding affection for those whom he created. The particularity of God’s relationship to his covenant people (“God in Zion,” Psalm 65:1) is inseparable from his relationship to all the world (“the hope of all the ends of the earth,” 65:5). Then, when the Psalmist moves from the specificity of God-in-Zion’s redemption for iniquities to the fact that he created the world and maintains it, he shows us the unity of God’s love and the inseparability of his actions. It is not as if God provides rain for all the world out of duty or obligation; he does so because he delights to do good toward we his children—even in our rebellion! The result is that “those who dwell at the ends of the earth are in awe at [his] signs” (65:8). God’s atonement, reconciling his people, doing righteousness and justice, and his creative and sustaining power in creation all come around to the same end: the world worshipping him, the world in right relation with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So with David, and with the meadows, I want to “shout and sing together for joy” (65:13) at all the works of the God in Zion. It is good to be surprised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not the point of today’s meditations, but nonetheless worth note: contra many an overly simplified evangelical presentation of the relationship between the eras before and after the Incarnation, Old Testament believers relied on God for their salvation from sins just as we do. They knew that he was the one who atoned for them (Psalm 65:3) and that it was he who brought them near, not the other way around (Psalm 65:4).&lt;a href="#fnref1"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;No claim here that I am particularly &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; at poetry, mind, but Jaimie seems to like it, and that is good enough for me.&lt;a href="#fnref2"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

I read, to be sure, and every once in a long while I even go on a spree where I follow links from one site to another (or just in a long trail on Wikipedia). In general, however, I no longer surf. I suspect I am not alone in this: if we took a straw poll I would venture that most of my friends offline and acquaintances online alike spend rather less time in “browsing” mode than they do reading Facebook or Twitter or Instagram. Motion from link to link has been replaced by individual hops out onto Buzzfeed or a viral cat picture website.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The obvious explanation for all of this is already there in what I’ve written: Facebook and Twitter and all the rest of the social media web. To be sure, the advent of social media and the increasing degree to which social media have captured user attention on the web are a significant factor in the end of the old surfing/browsing behavior. This is a dream come true for those social media giants which have found ways to deliver ads to their many millions of users and thereby turn enormous profits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, I think there is an oft-overlooked factor in the shifting nature of the web over the last decade: the browser. In fact, if there is any single cause behind the death of old-fashioned surfing, I would point to Firefox 1.0: the browser which popularized tabbed browsing to increasingly large sections of the internet-using public.&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The open-source browser steadily ate away at Internet Explorer’s then absurd levels of dominance, until Internet Explorer 8 included of tabs itself. By the time that Chrome came on the scene, tabbed browsing had long since become a given.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why do I think that &lt;em&gt;tabbed browsing&lt;/em&gt; of all things contributed to the end of “browsing” and “surfing” as our dominant mode of reading the internet? Simply put: it broke linearity. Previously,&lt;a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; one’s experience of the web was single- stranded, leaping from one point to another in a line that however contorted was always connected by the forward and backward buttons on the browser. The moment tabbed browsing came on the scene, that line was broken. Following a link might mean it opened in a new tab instead of moving the whole view forward to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surfing as I remember it in the late ’90s and early ’00s was inherently the experience of getting lost along that timeline, finding myself dozens of links along the chain and wondering how I had ended up there, and then being able to trace my way back. With tabs, that traceability was gone. With it went the inherent tension that we faced with every link: to follow, or not? To get sucked down into &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; vortex or &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;? Because in all likelihood, we knew, we were not going to be coming back to this page. With tabs, though, I could open both of those pages without ever leaving this one. I could start new journeys without ending the old. But there was a hidden cost: that newly opened tab had no history. It was a clean slate; before that newly opened link there was only a blank page. If I closed the original from which I had opened it, there was no going back.&lt;a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; If I closed this new tabs, there was no going forward to them. The line was broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there it was only a short step to the idea of a single site being the center from which one ventured out to other points on the web before returning: the Facebooks and Twitters of the world. In some sense, Facebook’s entire model is predicated on the idea that it is natural to open a new tab with that juicy Buzzfeed content while keeping Facebook itself open in a background tab. Would it work in that old linear model? Sort of. Would it feel natural? Never.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this because of tabs. Invention’s most significant results are rarely those the minds behind it expect. When we are designing things—whether a piece of furniture or a piece of the web—we have to remember that design decisions all have repercussions that we may not see. Technology is never neutral. Particular innovations may or may not be &lt;em&gt;morally&lt;/em&gt; significant, but they always produce changes in people’s behavior. Design has consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the record, lots of that hopping from link to link was on Buzzfeed- like and viral-cat-picture-like sites, too. I am not concerned with the &lt;em&gt;kind&lt;/em&gt; of content being read here, so much as the way it is being read.&lt;a href="#fnref1"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that I am not crediting Firefox 1.0 with &lt;em&gt;creating&lt;/em&gt; the tabbed browser—only with popularizing it. That distinction matters.&lt;a href="#fnref2"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn3"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excepting having multiple browser windows open, which I am sure people did—but to a much lesser extent.&lt;a href="#fnref3"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn4"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, yes, browser history and re-open closed tab commands. But the &lt;em&gt;experience&lt;/em&gt; of those is different, and that’s what we’re talking about here.&lt;a href="#fnref4"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

Perhaps by the time I am done writing, I will see a connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="psalm-64" class="level6"&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Psalm 64&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading through the Psalms often serves as a reminder for me that the easy way of life I enjoy is not normal either in historical terms or in normative terms for the people of God. Suffering and opposition are &lt;em&gt;ordinary&lt;/em&gt;, so much so that prayers for deliverance from the plots of the enemies of God are themselves ordinary in the Psalms. Certainly for David such things were a regular part of his life, and so it has been for many believers throughout the ages, and so it is today for many around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Psalm does not stop with the acknowledgement that there are people in the world would do God’s people harm, though. It moves immediately on to the reality that God delivers his people. The inversion is striking: those who lay in ambush, who “shoot arrows” at the innocent find &lt;em&gt;God’s&lt;/em&gt; arrows coming for them (Psalm 64:4,7). In the small narrative arc this song traces out, the ambushers who set out to destroy the righteous are themselves destroyed. Their destruction leads all the world to magnify God. The righteous rejoice in Yahweh, take refuge in him, and exult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It strikes me that in a way, this arc is a very short telling of the arc of history itself. The enemies of God have a time in which they can work, but ultimately they will be ended, and all the earth will be filled with the glory of Yahweh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="proverbs-26" class="level6"&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Proverbs 26&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first half of this chapter is a sequence of comparisons: increasingly terrible or ridiculous things with a fool.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The fact that the fool comes off looking absurd is the point—so that when we get to Proverbs 26:12, the conclusion is all the more forceful:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you see a man who is wise in his own eyes?&lt;br /&gt;
There is more hope for a fool than for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As bad as it is to be a fool—a point that both the book as a whole and the preceding ten verses have labored to make clear—being wise in one’s own eyes is even worse.&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The book has made clear over and over again that there is basically no hope for a fool, though Wisdom is still inviting even fools to turn from their ways (Proverbs 8:5). But for the man who is wise in his own eyes, what recourse is there?&lt;a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="first-corinthians-46" class="level6"&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;First Corinthians 4–6&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What better picture of reliance on one’s own wisdom than the church at Corinth? One can nearly see Paul tearing his hair out over this church, which seemed determined to run off into the weeds in every possible way. By the end of chapter 6, he has already addressed factionalism, sexual immorality of an extraordinary sort, and Christians suing each other in court. Moreover, he has had to deal with the fact that they considered themselves wiser than the apostles (basically throughout all of chapter 4). Following this so-called wisdom was destroying them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few highlights that particularly caught my attention here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paul admonished his audience to judge themselves rightly, but to remember that even in their own self-judgment they had to acknowledge that God alone knows all our faults.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As for outsiders, the church was not to “judge” them, leaving that to God. Judgment here must imply something besides moral assessment, however, because Paul explicitly calls out the follies of the unregenerate world (e.g. sexual immorality, greed, swindling, idolatry—see 1 Corinthians 5:10). It means rather that the Corinthians’ response was not to be the rejection enjoined of them as regarded unrepentant people in their own midst. The church exercises discipline on its members, not on the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When Paul encourages the Corinthians to reject sexual immorality, he grounds it in the resurrection. Indeed, Paul turns to the resurrection about as often (and perhaps more often) as to the cross in this book—a point N. T. Wright’s delightful and excellent &lt;em&gt;The Resurrection of the Son of God&lt;/em&gt; makes forcefully. God raised Jesus from the dead, and he will raise us from the dead, so we ought to regard our bodies accordingly. They are temples of God indwelt by the Spirit, and ultimately destined for glory. &lt;em&gt;That&lt;/em&gt; is why we ought to flee sexual immorality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div id="refs" class="references"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section class="footnotes"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interrupting the sequence is the classic wisdom paradox of the book: Proverbs 26:4–5, withits paired injunctions to answer and not to answer a fool according to his folly.&lt;a href="#fnref1"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rhetorical force of the placement of this particular set of proverbs near the end of the book, as well as the structure of this section, is one of many arguments for a coherent editorial strategy in the creation of Proverbs. All you have to do is read the book to get this.&lt;a href="#fnref2"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn3"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This verse is one of the keys in my understanding of Ecclesiastes: &lt;em&gt;Qoheleth&lt;/em&gt; was wise in his own eyes, and it nearly destroyed him.&lt;a href="#fnref3"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been common these past few years to speak of “incarnational theology” as a way of describing the Christian mission to the world: we ought to “incarnate” Christ to the world as Christ “incarnated” the Godhead to us. There is much to appreciate in this sentiment…. Yet for all that, I think that applying the language of incarnation to believers is a serious mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Incarnation matters, and it matters as more than a means of getting Jesus to the cross so that he could die for our sins. We evangelicals too often reduce everything to penal substitutionary atonement. Yes, the atonement is incredible and amazing. It is one of the central affirmations and joys of the Christian faith: our sins are paid for! Glory to God! But Jesus did more than that, and he is worthy of yet more praise. He did not stop at paying the price for our sins while leaving our bodies subject to corruption. He did not content himself with performing a judicial act while leaving our wills broken, certain to turn again to the same sin that led to our death in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think &lt;a href="http://mereorthodoxy.com/god-become-man-richer-theology-incarnation/"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; is the best thing I’ve written so far this year; I hope you find it stimulating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="refs" class="references"&gt;

</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chris Krycho</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2014 08:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:www.chriskrycho.com,2014-03-25:2014/god-become-man-toward-a-richer-theology-of-the-incarnation.html</guid><category>links</category><category>my writing elsewhere</category></item><item><title>Surprising Unity</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/surprising-unity.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;The surprising unity&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the church has been a recurring theme on my mind lately. Reading through 1 Corinthians was sure to bring the notion back to the forefront, of course: the book has several prominent topics, but unity is the one to which Paul returns again and again and the one with which he opens the book. The first few chapters are an indictment of the Corinthians for their factionalism, punctuated&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by a theological grounding for that indictment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of structure, Paul’s epistles to the Corinthians are fairly unique among his writings. Unlike the normal structure of his letters, in which there are fairly clear divisions between expository and hortatory material (though with the requisite qualification that he is often including some exhortations during the exposition and vice versa), his letters to the Corinthians are constantly jumping back and forth between the two. He makes a point, grounds it in the nature of the gospel, and then repeats. First Corinthians circles back to the theme of unity over and over again in this fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1 Corinthians 1:18–2, Paul explains the call to unity he laid out in chapter 1 and to which he returns in chapter 3 in terms of Christ’s and the Spirit’s work. What Christ did looked like an incomprehensible weakness to the Jews who were expecting their messiah to come in power, and incomprehensible folly to the Greeks who expected any true leader to come in a demonstration of wisdom. Both of these Jesus set on their heads. In this surprising inversion—so typical of Christ’s work—is forged the grounds for Christian unity. None of us have cause for boasting; God is our wisdom and our power, our righteousness and sanctification and redemption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this is accomplished in our midst by the Spirit. Not only do we have nothing apart from Jesus Christ, but we cannot even rightly appropriate him and what he offers on our own. This strength and wisdom we have in Christ is mediated by the Spirit of God. What Paul taught, he taught not in human wisdom by “by the Spirit” (1 Corinthians 2:13), and only those who were empowered by the Spirit could understand them. They were (and are) folly to anyone who is operating in human understanding alone.&lt;a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unity of the church, which is one of the ways that the world knows us as Christ’s (per the Gospel of John) is, like everything in our faith ultimately a gift from the Triune God. We must actively obey the call to unity, and it will not happen without our effort, but it is Father-given, Son-mediated, Spirit- empowered obedience to walk in a Father-given, Son-mediated, Spirit-empowered way. In some sense, this is &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of our sanctification: learning more and more to obey in humble dependence on God who is our all in all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="refs" class="references"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;section class="footnotes"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A phrase I borrowed from one our pastors at First Baptist Durham, Dr. Andy Davis.&lt;a href="#fnref1"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can almost think of the structure as analogous to a sentence with content set off by an em-dash—like so, with some explanatory comment here in the middle—and then continuing to a conclusion. Yes, that’s an absurdly nerdy comparison.&lt;a href="#fnref2"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn3"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One might suggest that the issue is &lt;em&gt;fallen&lt;/em&gt; human understanding, and this is right so far as it goes… but the reason fallen human understanding fails is because it is not reliant on God. Unfallen, or restored, human understanding is wise precisely because it fears Yahweh (cf. Proverbs 1:7).&lt;a href="#fnref3"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

The chapters sweep from the Jewish leaders’ plot with Judas to get Jesus’ turned over to them, through Jesus’ celebration of the Passover with his disciples,&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; through his prayers in the garden and betrayal by Judas, through his multiple farcical trials, through his brutal crucifixion and death, to his resurrection from the dead and revelation of himself as the Anointed One of God to his disciples. Luke’s narrative up to this point has a fairly measured pace, with a great deal of time devoted to long stretches of Jesus’ teaching, but here at the climax event piles on event in a way that seems designed to take one’s breath away. &lt;em&gt;Here&lt;/em&gt; is the finale toward which Jesus had been pointing ever since the &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/lukes-hinge.html"&gt;hinge in the book&lt;/a&gt; back in the ninth chapter: his death and resurrection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few observations that particularly stood out to me today. First, when Jesus instituted the Lord’s Supper, he also told his disciples of the betrayal that would shortly come at one of their hands, and they were troubled. They “began to question one another, which of them it could be who was going to do this” (Luke 22:23). What Luke drops in next is a surprise:&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at the same time, they started arguing about who was the greatest (22:24). They did not recognize that the same basic impulse that would motivate one of them to betray the one they confessed as Lord and Messiah—fallen human self-absorption and self-interest—also motivated this discussion of greatness. Jesus upends this, pointing out here that he had come “as the one who serves” (22:7). Their reward would be greater than any of them could wish: being enthroned beside him to judge the twelve tribes of Israel—but because they had stayed with him in his trials, not because of their own inherent greatness (22:28–30).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus instructed the disciples to sell a cloak to buy a sword, learned that they had a pair of swords, and told them that it was enough (22:37–38). Then, when the disciples actually went to use those swords, Jesus forbade them, and undid what they had done. It is almost as if he made sure that they had the swords there precisely so that he could teach this object lesson. The Anointed One of God came not to kill but to be killed, just as he had come not to be served but to serve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his trial, Jesus simply did not answer his accusers. They took his silence, and his acknowledgment that they were accusing him, as all the proof they needed. Why? Because they needed no more proof than their accusations. Interestingly, both Herod and Pilate clearly abuse their authority, causing Jesus to be mocked and beaten even while admitting that they found nothing for which he ought to be punished (still less crucified). Pilate in particular comes off looking terrible: he repeatedly tells the crowd that he can see no reason why Jesus ought to be crucified, and that he intends to let him go, but caves to the pressure of the crowd (23:1–25). The fear of man can lead us to do wretched things. Pilate decided to release a murderer and insurrectionist—the latter being precisely the crime of which Jesus was accused!—instead of an innocent man, because of the demands of a crowd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barabbas himself strikes me as an interesting figure in Luke’s narrative. He was what Jesus was accused of being, and he went free with Jesus taking his place. Every time I read through this passage, it strikes me again that Luke gave us here a clear picture of the substitutionary work of Christ on our behalf. Here we have a man who clearly deserved his punishment under the law of his day, going free with Jesus being punished instead. I have no idea whether Barabbas ever truly appreciated what happened to him, by which I mean whether he repented of his sins and believed in the one who was his substitute in more ways than one. I do know that the picture, especially when set side by side with Paul’s teaching on the topic, reminds me that &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; am like Barabbas in the story: set free because of Jesus’ going in my stead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I love reading the narratives of the resurrection. It was then as it is now: too good to be true, almost too good to be believed. The disciples, though Jesus had taught them that he would die and be resurrected, simply did not grasp his meaning. Even when they were told that he had been raised, they did not believe it until he showed himself to them—and then they thought they saw a ghost until he convinced them by eating some fish! The resurrection was in no one’s game plan but God’s. But now it is our future hope and our joyful expectation as well. And it is because of the resurrection from the dead that they went, and that we go to proclaim repentance and forgiveness of sins in Jesus’ name to all nations (Luke 24:46–47).&lt;/p&gt;

In due time, the project got put on hold, as I started up classes again and needed to focus more on my family than on fun side projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come the beginning of 2014, I was ready to bit WordPress farewell once and for all, though. While &lt;a href="https://ghost.org"&gt;Ghost&lt;/a&gt; looks interesting, since I do all my writing in Markdown files, there is something tempting about the canonical version of the documents being the version on my computer (and thus also on my iPad and iPhone and anywhere I have Dropbox and/or Git access). I did not have time at the beginning of the year to finish writing Step Stool, and I knew as much,&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; so instead I moved to &lt;a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.3.0/"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt; as a stop-gap. There were lots of good reasons to pick Pelican: it has an active development community, fairly thorough documentation,&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and it’s in Python and uses Jinja2 templates—the same basic approach I had taken with Step Stool, and the same toolset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, while I have been glad to be away from WordPress, my experience with Pelican so far has only reinforced my desire to get Step Stool done. There are &lt;em&gt;lots&lt;/em&gt; of little things that it does in ways that just annoy me. Many of them have to do with configuration and documentation. On the latter, while the documentation is &lt;em&gt;fairly&lt;/em&gt; complete, there are quite a few holes and gaps. (Yes, yes, open source software and anyone can add to the docs. That’s great—it really is—but if I’m going to use someone else’s solution, it had better &lt;em&gt;just work&lt;/em&gt;. Otherwise, I’d rather spend my time getting my own going.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if you want to see how the pagination actually works, good luck figuring it out from the documentation. You’ll need to go looking at the way the sample themes (yes, both of them) are implemented to start getting a feel for it. Along the same lines, many of the objects that get handed to the templates are not fully documented, so it is difficult to know what one can or cannot do. I do not particularly want to spend my time adding debug print statements to my templates just to figure out what options I have available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same kinds of things hold true for configuration options. Moreover, the configuration is done through a Python module. While that makes the module easier to integrate on the code side of things, it makes its actual content much less transparent than one might hope. Python is not really well optimized for writing configuration files—nor is any normal programming language. Configuration is inherently declarative, rather than imperative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that Pelican is bad software. It is not. It is, however, a fairly typical example of open source software implemented by committee. It has holes (some of them serious), bumps, and quirks. Here is the reality: so will Step Stool, though they will be the quirks that come from an individual developer’s approach rather than a group’s. But the one thing I can guarantee, and the reason I am increasingly motivated to get back to working on Step Stool. And yes, I do have a couple other projects on my plate as well—contributions to the Smartypants and Typogrify modules, my own &lt;a href="https://bitbucket.org/chriskrycho/spacewell"&gt;Spacewell typography project&lt;/a&gt;, and quite possibly a &lt;a href="https://bitbucket.org/chriskrycho/markdown-poetry/"&gt;Markdown Poetry extension&lt;/a&gt;. But I would like very much to just get back to doing this myself. There is freedom in rolling my own solution to things. I will not always have time to do these kinds of things; I figure I should do them when I can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here’s to &lt;a href="http://step-stool.io"&gt;Step Stool&lt;/a&gt;, and—more importantly—to writing your own software just to scratch that itch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I spent quite a bit of time tweaking my friend Vernon King’s &lt;a href="http://www.vernonking.org"&gt;Jekyll-powered site&lt;/a&gt;, I got Winning Slowly off the ground, including designing the site from scratch and implementing it (also in Pelican), and I did some substantial redesign work on this site. That was more than enough for my three week break—as evidenced by the fact that I didn’t get to the sort of 1.0 version of this site until just a week or so ago.&lt;a href="#fnref1"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As I was cleaning up the dishes and playing Max Richter’s &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/memoryhouse/id545010150"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Memoryhouse&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; album, I saw Ellie dancing, and encouraged her to keep going. After a moment, I looked over to see her spinning in circles. And spinning in circles. And spinning in circles. When she finally stopped, she started freaking out as she couldn’t get her balance. I swooped in and picked her up, laughing with her once she recovered.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After she calmed down, she started tugging on my shirt. It took me a few seconds to realize what she wanted, but then it clicked: she was trying to turn me by twisting my shirt. “You want to spin?” I asked her. She nodded vigorously. “Is this a spinning song?” Again, the vigorous nod. So I started spinning around and around with her in my arms, and the sheer joy in the grin plastered across her face was something to behold. We spun first one way, then the other, all the way through &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfoSv8iWA_I"&gt;“The Twins (Prague)”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moments like these are worth remembering.&lt;/p&gt;

That might seem a strange way to open a devotions post, but it connects. Trust me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was reading through Luke 14, 15, and 16 this morning, trying to put the various pieces of the narratives together in the way that Luke intended. Whenever I am reading, I am always trying to understand the text &lt;em&gt;as a text&lt;/em&gt;, because that is how it was created and how God inspired it. The words we read are not abstract things, magic talismanic elements we can mix together as we please. The authors did things intentionally, as any good author does, and if we are paying attention, we will learn things from the construction of the books as we read them.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there I was, working my way through Luke 16, and I came to a verse about which I have thought a great deal because of its implications for pastoral ministry, laid out thus in the ESV:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one dot of the Law to become void.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="divorce-and-remarriage"&gt;Divorce and Remarriage&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery, and he who marries a woman divroced from her husband commits adultery.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="the-rich-man-and-lazarus"&gt;The Rich Man and Lazarus&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There was a rich man…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Luke 16:17–19a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On its face, Luke 16:18 is fairly straightforward—granting that the amount of ink spilled over the issues of divorce and remarriage means it is not &lt;em&gt;totally&lt;/em&gt; straightforward. But the straightforwardness of the statement is much diminished if we separate out those headings and situate the verse in its broader context. Here is the whole chapter (which is &lt;em&gt;perhaps&lt;/em&gt; just enough context). I have bolded 16:18 below, and removed all the headings. To feel the full force of the issue, I really do recommend you read the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also said to the disciples, “There was a rich man who had a manager, and charges were brought to him that this man was wasting his possessions. And he called him and said to him, ‘What is this that I hear about you? Turn in the account of your management, for you can no longer be manager.’ And the manager said to himself, ‘What shall I do, since my master is taking the management away from me? I am not strong enough to dig, and I am ashamed to beg. I have decided what to do, so that when I am removed from management, people may receive me into their houses.’ So, summoning his master’s debtors one by one, he said to the first, ‘How much do you owe my master?’ He said, ‘A hundred measures of oil.’ He said to him, ‘Take your bill, and sit down quickly and write fifty.’ Then he said to another, ‘And how much do you owe?’ He said, ‘A hundred measures of wheat.’ He said to him, ‘Take your bill, and write eighty.’ The master commended the dishonest manager for his shrewdness. For the sons of this world are more shrewd in dealing with their own generation than the sons of light. And I tell you, make friends for yourselves by means of unrighteous wealth, so that when it fails they may receive you into the eternal dwellings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One who is faithful in a very little is also faithful in much, and one who is dishonest in a very little is also dishonest in much. If then you have not been faithful in the unrighteous wealth, who will entrust to you the true riches? And if you have not been faithful in that which is another’s, who will give you that which is your own? No servant can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pharisees, who were lovers of money, heard all these things, and they ridiculed him. And he said to them, “You are those who justify yourselves before men, but God knows your hearts. For what is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Law and the Prophets were until John; since then the good news of the kingdom of God is preached, and everyone forces his way into it. But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one dot of the Law to become void.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**“Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery, and he who marries a woman divorced from her husband commits adultery.**&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There was a rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen and who feasted sumptuously every day. And at his gate was laid a poor man named Lazarus, covered with sores, who desired to be fed with what fell from the rich man’s table. Moreover, even the dogs came and licked his sores. The poor man died and was carried by the angels to Abraham’s side. The rich man also died and was buried, and in Hades, being in torment, he lifted up his eyes and saw Abraham far off and Lazarus at his side. And he called out, ‘Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus to dip the end of his finger in water and cool my tongue, for I am in anguish in this flame.’ But Abraham said, ‘Child, remember that you in your lifetime received your good things, and Lazarus in like manner bad things; but now he is comforted here, and you are in anguish. And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm has been fixed, in order that those who would pass from here to you may not be able, and none may cross from there to us.’ And he said, ‘Then I beg you, father, to send him to my father’s house—for I have five brothers—so that he may warn them, lest they also come into this place of torment.’ But Abraham said, ‘They have Moses and the Prophets; let them hear them.’ And he said, ‘No, father Abraham, but if someone goes to them from the dead, they will repent.’ He said to him, ‘If they do not hear Moses and the Prophets, neither will they be convinced if someone should rise from the dead.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What in the &lt;em&gt;world&lt;/em&gt; is this passage on divorce and remarriage doing in the middle of a discussion about handling wealth? Every other piece here fits together in a fairly obvious fashion. The parable about the rich man and Lazarus is clearly a rejoinder to the Pharisees attitude toward money. That attitude in turn was exposed by the Pharisees’ response to another parable about the relatively value of wealth in this life. Sandwiched between the two is this statement about divorce and remarriage—one that would seem perfectly clear on its own, but which set against the backdrop of this discussion on money seems to be aiming at something other than divorce and remarriage alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In truth, I am not entirely sure &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; Luke is doing here. My first guess, and one that Jaimie suggested as well when I pointed this out to her this morning, is that he is highlighting the way Jesus takes the law in contrast to the Pharisees. Whereas they were concerned with keeping the law in letter, he was concerned with the principle of the law. This is the same rhetorical move he makes in Matthew’s recounting of the Sermon on the Mount with this same issue, heightening the sense of the law by sharpening its demands on the listeners. “Here, you ‘righteous’ Pharisees,” Jesus seems to be saying, “I’ll see your legal requirements and raise you double that”—just before he goes on to hammer away yet more at their self-righteousness. That, in turn, makes the parables before and after this that much more convicting, that much more of a &lt;a href="/2014/sell-your-possessions-and-give-to-the-needy.html"&gt;heart check&lt;/a&gt;. That is to the good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In truth, I am still not &lt;em&gt;sure&lt;/em&gt; that is what is going on here; tomorrow I intend to spend some time looking at this issue in the commentaries. But the heading obscures that there is even a point to be seen here. I nearly missed it this morning. I &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; missed it in the past, nearly every time I read through this section. I am therefore all the more strongly resolved to read the books of the Bible as books—to find ways to get away from the headings, whenever possible, and let the text be the text, as it was written and as it was inspired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="refs" class="references"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;section class="footnotes"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make the point a bit more forcefully: Can you imagine taking apart Shakespeare and trying to understand one couplet from a sonnet apart from the rest of the sonnet? Or trying to understand Eliot’s &lt;em&gt;Four Quartets&lt;/em&gt; by reading a line here and a line there? It would be absurd and laughable, and rightly so.&lt;a href="#fnref1"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you run in certain Facebook circles, you’ve likely already read that North Korean leader Kim Jung-un has called for the execution of 33 North Korean Christians. According to the widely circulated reports, these 33 people were detained after it was discovered they had ties to Kim Jung-wook, a South Korean missionary whose arrest for religious activity last year has made international headlines….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here’s the thing: No one can verify this call for executions actually took place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great example of journalism done right, and of how Christians ought to carry ourselves in the public square. It matters whether our facts are right or not— even when the “message” might be right either way. The &lt;a href="http://christandpopculture.com/33-christians-north-korea-really-execution/"&gt;whole thing&lt;/a&gt; is worth your time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fear not, little flock, for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom. Sell your possessions, and give to the needy. Provide yourselves with moneybags that do not grow old, with a treasure in the heavens that does not fail, where no thief approaches and no moth destroys. For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those words are compelling and troubling. “Sell your possessions and give to the needy.” These are not difficult to understand. Nor, in truth, are they particularly difficult to put into practice. The early church clearly saw that they should behave this way, and did so: just look at Acts 2:44–45, 4:32–35. This is not the pattern I see in the church around me today, for the most part. Nor, more worrisome, is it exactly the pattern of my own life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be sure, Jaimie and I have long since established habits of sacrificial giving.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; We aim to be generous with our things, not holding them tightly, as well as with our time and our home. We have aimed to be hospitable, to open our home to those who need space, and so on. But I am not sure that I would say we are always characterized by this. I do not think we have ever sold one of our things &lt;em&gt;in order&lt;/em&gt; to be willing to give it to someone in need. As I ponder, I have no doubt that if one of our brothers or sisters in Christ were in great need—and especially one of those in our church—we would be willing to do so. But we have &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; done so, and so this passage forced me to think about a Christ-following ethic regarding our possessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am sitting here typing this on a very nice computer, in a very nice home, with many niceties around me. I have no doubt that we could sell some of these things in order to have money to give to others. I am left wondering: &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; we? It does not seem to me to be possible always to be selling the things we have to give them to others. Eventually one would simply run out of things to sell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I note, too, that the context here shows us that Jesus is addressing a very specific fault: worry about and pursuit of wealth. In this section he takes aim at dependence on material possessions for security, pointing us to trust in God instead of our things. He hammers away at the idea that we could somehow provide for ourselves better than God does. We reminds us that all we have will be destroyed in the end. He undercuts all our idolatry in this area. It would be easy, then, to say that his words here are illustrative to that end, and not really meaning quite what they seem to say. I think any such move would do the text an injustice. Jesus said what he said, and we had better pay attention. More: we had better obey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not the having of things that is the problem, it seems to me. It is clinging to them. It is seeing them as more important than people. The question I pondered earlier is the important one: &lt;em&gt;Would Jaimie and I gladly part with possessions to serve others who are in need?&lt;/em&gt; The answer to that is certainly yes—and indeed, we &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; parted generously with our money and our things in the past. We have not &lt;em&gt;sold&lt;/em&gt; possessions to give the proceeds to others, but have at times foregone purchases to give the money to others, and we have given items themselves to others in need. We are moving in the right direction here. Nonetheless, the heart check is an important one, and one to which we prosperous Americans should return regularly. It is too easy for us to justify sitting in our comfort without regard to the needs around us, and to fail thereby to obey Jesus’ clear commands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="refs" class="references"&gt;

&lt;section class="footnotes"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I thought about listing the ways we give, then thought better of it in light of &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; of Jesus’ commands about how we should think about and act about money.&lt;a href="#fnref1"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

This simple statement uncovers a great deal about the necessity of Christ’s resurrection as well as his death on our behalf, as does much of the rest of the New Testament’s view of the resurrection. Paul tells us, for example, that Christ died for our trespasses and was raised for our justification (Romans 4:25). Likewise, he notes Jesus’ resurrection from the dead is intrinsically linked to our own life (e.g. Romans 8:11). Moreover, we know that if Jesus was not raised from the dead, then neither will we be (1 Corinthians 15:16). We know that it was in the resurrection that Jesus was shown to be the Son of God in power (Romans 1:4) and thus the one who reigns over all things. Moreover, we note that the preaching of the apostles as recorded in Acts refers to the resurrection of Christ as the evidence that he is indeed the Jewish messiah and the judge of the earth— indeed, from Acts we see that the apostolic message &lt;em&gt;centered&lt;/em&gt; on the resurrection of Christ. Likewise, the very shape of the gospels is such that each in its own way climaxes not with Jesus’ death but with his resurrection, as if to say that the central issue of our faith is not the death of Christ but his being raised from the dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we put together all these pieces, it becomes clear that the resurrection is integral in our salvation. It is not merely the “seal” upon the work Jesus did at the cross, the evidence that the cross accomplished what it needed to. It is part and parcel of our salvation, in and of itself. It is true that the resurrection does indeed ratify the elements of the saving work of Christ that were accomplished on the cross, but this is not all that it does. It seems clear from the evidence of the New Testament that the resurrection itself is efficacious in saving us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If our mortal bodies are corrupted by sin, as we know they are, and if the penalty of sin is death, as we know it is, then something more than payment for sin must happen. Payment for sin is necessary, and so Jesus’ substitutionary atonement in death on the cross is essential to our salvation. However, there is more that is essential to our salvation. Reconciliation between God and man began in the Incarnation, as in Jesus the Son of God united humanity and deity in perfect fellowship once again, and it was accomplished (though not yet finished) in the resurrection as Jesus took up a restored body in which the power of sin and death were finally broken: an image of what our bodies will be in the age to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, we know that if we die as things were before the Resurrection, even were our sins paid for, we remain mortal and would never rise again of our own merits. In his resurrection, Jesus triumphed over death—the last enemy—and we know that the same Spirit that raised him from the dead will raise us from the dead. We know that Jesus’ resurrection is the means of our justification. He paid for our sins in his atoning death, but he sets us right with God in his triumphant new life. We know that his reign as the rightful heir of all things was inaugurated in his resurrection, not in his death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, essential as was his death for our salvation, the resurrection of Christ is no less important in our being restored to life with God.&lt;/p&gt;

Div.</category><category>SEBTS</category></item><item><title>Luke's Hinge</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/lukes-hinge.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Luke structures his narrative in an interesting way. From his introduction and the beginning of Jesus’ ministry, he moves along through a fairly short section of material before he describes Jesus’ turn toward Jerusalem. Starting as early as chapter 9—less than halfway through the book—Jesus begins predicting his death and discussing his plans to go to Jerusalem. In the sequences that follow, Jesus experiences the transfiguration, begins outright attacking the Pharisees and lawyers, and grows increasingly impatient with the crowds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even as many times as I have read these chapters, the force of them hit me anew today. Jesus remains the compassionate shepherd of the sheep, but with a startling suddenness he manifests his impatience with the people whom Paul would later describe by noting that “not all Israel is Israel” (see Romans 9:6ff.). The crowds who gathered around were not all true followers; the Pharisees and lawyers who knew best the word that spoke of him were those who most failed to understand him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have long found Jesus’ post-Transfiguration response to the man seeking healing for his son puzzling. Ordinarily, Jesus had been quick to compassion toward people like this. Only a chapter earlier, he had been praising the faith of a woman who had touched him and been healed, and responding to the earnest pleas of a family for the healing of their daughter. But here, he complains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O faithless and twisted generation, how long am I to be with you and bear with you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; what we expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Luke’s narrative, there is a hinge in 9:21–36. Here, Jesus first predicts his death, then tells his disciples that they must take up their cross daily and follow him, and then experiences the Transfiguration. Afterward, this new impatience, which comes bubbling out not only in this encounter but in woes against unrepentant cities and against the teachers and lawyers. It is not that his compassion ceases, but that his frustration shows up alongside it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The turn here highlighted several things for me. First, Jesus saw what I too easily miss, even in having read these passages so often. When he complains about bearing with a twisted and faithless generation, it is because that generation &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; twisted and faithless, even if to my eyes the difference is not immediately obvious. But the contrast &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be clear, and it becomes clearer given this broader setting for the various confrontations. Luke sets up this encounter with a man seeking healing for his demoniac son against the backdrop of a gathered crowd, and only a few verses after Jesus has said, “The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised.” He knew full well that the hearts of the crowd were not turned to him as the Messiah whom they should worship. They were people who wanted miracles and nothing more. The moment they were given the right opportunity, these same people could and would turn on him—as they did. So when we see Jesus acting in ways that surprise us, it points us back to the ways that his divinity and humanity mingled. He knew their hearts, as he knew what they would be doing to him soon enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also highlights the reality of how Jesus partakes in the same attitude toward faithless generations that we see in the Godhead throughout the Old Testament. So often, we separate the two Testaments functionally, even if we consciously affirm their unity. But the same compassion we see in Christ is present in every interaction of God with his people and with the nations throughout the Old Testament. The same bubbling impatience that turns eventually to woe and judgment in the Old Testament is on display here in Christ. He is the loving savior who was marking the path toward Calvary, and he is the righteous judge who pronounced woe on those who rejected him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be easy to make the same mistake that the crowds did in those days: to celebrate Jesus for what he does for us, without worshipping him as the Son of God or kneeling to him as the Anointed King. Indeed, so often this is &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; what we do. We want to take the blessings of salvation, the help of the indwelling Holy Spirit, while continuing to go our own ways. We want to use God. Instead, we ought to humbly worship the one who calls us to leave behind everything to follow him and proclaim the kingdom (see Luke 9:57–62). We ought to rejoice that our names are written in the book of life, come what trials may, and worship the Christ of God who is risen and seated at the right hand of God.&lt;/p&gt;

Most of my readings for that class were &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt;. This one? Well, you’ll see.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leon Morris’ &lt;em&gt;The Atonement&lt;/em&gt; is, as near as I can tell, fairly well regarded. Given the importance of the doctrine of the atonement to our faith, I had hoped that the book would be a profitable read when I saw that it was assigned as reading for one of my classes this semester. Unfortunately, the book fell far short of my hopes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problems with the book are manifold. To begin, Morris is simply not a very good writer. Run-on sentences crop up regularly. He seems to be aiming for both a friendly conversational tone and erudition. (Conversational and scholarly writing are both fine; the combination fails miserably for nearly anyone but G.K. Chesterton or C.S. Lewis. Take it from me: I should know.) Most importantly, Morris’ chapters are essentially thesis-less, and the “conclusions” to which he comes rarely follow from the material presented in the rest of the chapter. The section on redemption was particularly egregious in this regard: he turned from a long discussion of redemption practices in the ancient world to a short summary focusing on the Christian view of sin in contrast to the modern world’s view of the human situation—with no transition or connection between the two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of the two basic problems with the book, in fact. His chapters are essentially aiming to do two different things. On the one hand, Morris is clearly interested in laying out the historical and linguistic background of the various ideas associated with the atonement (the sacrificial system, Passover, redemption, etc.). On the other hand, he clearly wants to find points of application to the Christian life. In each chapter, he spends most of his time on the first, then makes a rushed switch to the second for the final pages of the chapter. At no point is this transition well-written, and in no chapter does the application follow closely from the points he made in the background material. Even within the background material which dominates each chapter, Morris wanders. It is as if he is not sure whether he wanted to provide an informative overview of the context, to argue against various views others have offered regarding that background,&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or to make some sort of theological argument. Thus, he bounces between each of these modes rather haphazardly, sometimes even within a single paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This emphasis on background also rather defeats the purpose of the book. If the aim is to help people see and savor the glory of Christ’s atoning work on their behalf—a noble and worthy goal—then Morris simply did the wrong thing. He spends most of his time in the book on word studies, historical context, and so on. When he does get to his “application” sections,&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; he usually has said very little about Scripture’s teaching on the atonement. Telling people what words mean, or explaining the rabbis’ records of Second Temple Judaism practice, is not the same as explaining the Scriptures. The book reads like a sermon series from the historical-grammatical school where the background has been mistaken for the content instead of as a helpful tool where the content is not clear.&lt;a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Morris wastes his readers’ time with secondary matters and speeds over the riches of the text itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Morris &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; pay attention to the actual content of Scripture rather than its background, he tends to dwell on his hobby-horses instead of letting Scripture speak for itself. He often writes things like, “Of course, Scripture &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; include (one idea), but really we should take it (in some other way).”— where the latter is his preferred reading, and the former the way the text actually reads. Unsurprisingly, then, the best chapters in the book are those where his hobby-horses are nearest the actual point of the text in question. In the final three chapters of the book, he veers away into secondary matters much less and focuses on the text much more. It made for a significant improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alas, even this improvement did nothing to help resolve the other significant problem with the book. In short, Morris’ approach to New Testament doctrine is hopelessly reductionistic. Everything comes down to the idea of payment for the guilt of sin, even in chapters where he tries to talk about other things. Morris set out to write a book on the atonement, and instead of spending his time tracing out the atonement itself, he tried to make every other aspect of our salvation a part of the atonement. The book might have worked had it been titled &lt;em&gt;Salvation&lt;/em&gt;, but in seeking to make every part of God’s saving work into a mere aspect of atonement, Morris both diminished those other parts and failed to spend much time discussing the atonement itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this Morris is very much typical of evangelicalism, sad to say. We are a crucicentric people, and though this has its upsides, it also means we tend to rewrite all of our doctrines in terms of penal subtitutionary atonement, rather than letting them all work together as they do in the Bible. Atonement is one central and crucial (pun intended) part of our salvation, but it is not the whole of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morris’ book could have been a helpful volume; a robust doctrine of the atonement is a wonderful thing. I am sad to say that &lt;em&gt;The Atonement&lt;/em&gt; simply wasn’t very good. There are helpful bits scattered throughout, but to find them one must wade through a great deal of poorly written, unnecessarily polemical, disorganized, distracted meandering about things that are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the atonement (though they are themselves wonderful). I cannot recommend it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Including, unfortunately, the occasional joke about the Church Fathers’ views on aspects of the atonement are. At one point, he goes so far as to describe the Fathers’ “ransom view” of the atonement as silly and only worth laughing at. We might &lt;em&gt;disagree&lt;/em&gt; with the Fathers’ ransom view of the atonement, with God paying Satan—I do—but we hardly ought to laugh at them. This is chronological snobbery of the worst sort.&lt;a href="#fnref1"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Usually focusing on the shape of the Christian life—an odd choice in a book one would think would focus on the gospel itself. To be sure, I think that the atonement has enormous implications for the Christian life. Morris never shows &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; they connect, though, and he doesn’t spend any time talking about the marvel of the atonement itself for the Christian, either. It is just strange.&lt;a href="#fnref2"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn3"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the way that the historical-grammatical approach normally goes wrong. Other approaches have their own typical foibles, of course.&lt;a href="#fnref3"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems inevitable that our country will try to combat generational poverty and all its great harms by investing heavily in early childhood intervention. We already see signs of the State moving towards such programs with President Obama’s 2013 State of the Union address and Mayor de Blasio’s expanded pre-K. Tragically and despite enormous costs, de Blasio’s pre-K initiative in New York will most likely have very modest results, particularly since it begins intervention at age four, so late in the child’s mental development. The question for the church is, will we allow the state to take the initiative, or will we take up this task and engender the kind of deep, redemptive healing that the state can only dream of?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The language applied to him in Isaiah 53 in particular has long been understood by Christians to point directly to Jesus as the atoning savior. The role of the Servant in the book is somewhat more complex than a simple prediction of Jesus as subtitutionary atonement however: it encompasses that idea, but does much more as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The label of Servant is applied to two (or possibly three) different roles in Isaiah: the nation of Israel, and one who suffers and works on behalf of Israel. This latter role certainly contains messianic overtures, but may also include poetic references to Isaiah’s own suffering on behalf Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theme of the Servant first appears in chapter 40, and is immediately and directly applied in reference to Israel/Jacob. The same is true of its appearance in chapters 41 and 43, though the language used of the servant in chapter 42 suggests an individual and not the nation, and should perhaps be taken as pointing to a king who represents the nation given the national context. Beginning in chapter 45 and moving forward, the Servant increasingly appears as the individual who acts for Israel on Yahweh’s behalf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether the Servant-Israel or the Servant-for-Israel (as we might label them), the Servant exists to be God’s agent in bringing about the obedience of the nations. The Servant-Israel experiences cleansing and purification to that end, while the Servant-for-Israel experiences suffering in place of Israel, for her sins and to save her from her unrighteous ways.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; In both cases, the suffering is part of God’s plan to lead the nations out of their idolatry to participate in his covenant with Israel. The shape of the role taken by the Servant differs, though, and as the book progresses the need for the Servant-for-Israel becomes more and more clear, because the Servant-Israel is simply not up to the task (as was made clear by the first 39 chapters of the book!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the Servant-for-Israel acts on behalf of Israel in the latter parts of chapters 40–55. He picks up kingly responsibilities of doing justice and righteousness in the earth (a theme Isaiah seems to take up from the Psalms and elaborate). He stands as Israel’s representative in dealing with her sin. He brings the nations in to participate in Israel’s covenant life with God. In some sense, the messianic king figure becomes True Israel on Israel’s behalf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transition between Servant-Israel and Servant-for-Israel not only picks up messianic overtones, but also hints at autobiographical elements for Isaiah himself. Lest Christian readers be skittish at this notion, wanting to preserve the text’s unique way of pointing to Jesus: it is hardly uncommon for figures in the Old Testament to prefigure the messiah in various ways. Here it is Jesus’ role as Prophet we see prefigured, just asthe entire Levitical system prefigured him as Priest and David prefigured him as King. Isaiah’s suffering on behalf of Israel is a clear parallel to Jesus’ ministry, and Jesus himself makes this clear in his teaching in the New Testament, where he emphasizes that he came in part to close eyes and ears as well as open them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result of the progression is that the reader moves from seeing Israel as God’s servant to recognizing the need for a servant who will work as God’s agent on Israel’s behalf, to seeing that even Isaiah was an incomplete picture of this servant. The one of whom Isaiah prophesied would be not only Prophet but also king and both priest and sacrifice on behalf of the people. He would not only speak of the nations coming to participate in fellowship with God in the Zion of Israel, he would bring it about himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, the redemption pictured in Isaiah goes beyond subtitution for sins, and includes restoration to a holy nature—a theme that is picked up clearly in the New Testament but too often overlooked by modern readers.&lt;a href="#fnref1"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

Div.</category><category>SEBTS</category></item><item><title>Wisdom and Folly</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/wisdom-and-folly.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;The book of Proverbs opens with a lengthy introduction to the topic of wisdom, expounding its virtues and necessity and contrasting them with the costs of folly, before moving into the proverbs for which it is named. After a short introductory statement, the book moves into a series of extended metaphors for wisdom and folly to illustrate the point. These metaphors are those of the two women, the two houses, and the two ways—with the choices between the two illustrated in each case by the simple youth who may choose one or the other and become either wise or a fool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two women of the book are the Ladies Wisdom and Folly. Throughout the first nine chapters, the two stand in opposition to each other everywhere. Wisdom calls out on the streets, by the gates, and in the highest point of the city. She represents the first aspect of God’s order in the world, that foundational principle on which the world is built. She is an attribute of the creation God made and a reflection of his desires and character. By contrast, the adulteress (or “foreign woman”) who leads astray a simple youth and destroys him in chapter 7 is a picture not only of the particular follies of adultery but a personification of all that is foolish: wherever wisdom stands and calls out, so too does the adulteress—Lady Folly in one of her most deceptive forms. She is an image of what it means to go against the grain of God’s created order, and the consequence of going with her is death. No surprise, that: going against the structure of God’s reality has &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; led to death, beginning in Genesis 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two ways and two houses pick up this same motif and trace it out further. One way leads to life, the other to death. One house is steadfast and sure, while the other crumbles. One belongs to Wisdom, the other to Folly. These images Jesus picks up again in his own teaaching in the New Testament: The way that leads to life is narrow, and few find it, but the way that leads to destruction is wide and many walk it. The wise man builds his house on the rock that is Jesus’ word, but the foolish man builds his house on the sand that is worldly wisdom. The naïve youth may answer Lady Wisdom’s invitation and follow her along the way of wisdom to the house of wisdom and so become wise, or he may answer Lady Folly’s call, walk down folly’s road to the house of destruction and so become a fool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of the “wise person” and the “fool” then come up time and again throughout the rest of the book. Whatever one decides has the enormous consequences that the book traces out: fools become insolent, ignorant, murderous rebels against God, while wise people become gracious, temperate, gentle followers of God.&lt;/p&gt;

Div.</category><category>SEBTS</category></item><item><title>Job—The Mourner</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/job-the-mourner.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;The book of Job has most commonly been read as theodicy, i.e. as a defense of God’s goodness in the face of human suffering and the existence of evil in the world. This reading has a number of difficulties, not least in that though the characters in the book raise this question, neither God in his appearance nor the narrator offer an answer to it. Indeed, the final shape of the book is such that the reader has some understanding of why &lt;em&gt;Job&lt;/em&gt; suffered as he did—but only some. God’s reasons for acting in the particular ways he did remain hidden, and (more importantly) the answers we see in Job’s specific case are clearly not applicable to every case of human suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One possible way out of this problem is to approach the text from a different angle. Supposing that Job was not written as a theodicy, but as an exploration of an entirely different need, how might we read the book more profitably? One suggestion is that the central issue in the text is how Job might move from a position of ritual mourning back into a position of ritual life—and this approach does indeed yield significant exegetical fruit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of Job’s troubles experienced in the first two chapters of the book warranted his entering a state of ritual mourning: he experienced calamity in the loss of his possessions, the death of his sons and daughters, and the onset of a skin disease. The Levitical law proscribed the kinds of mourning an Israelite would undergo under each of these circumstances, and none were trivial. Though Job as a non-Israelite would not have lived under the Levitical law, he &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; live in a culture that embraced that pattern of ritual mourning in response to these problems, and the Israelite audience would have recognized his behavior as such. Thus, in Job 1–2, we see Job respond to his great calamity by tearing his clothes, going out of the town and sitting on the trash heap, and scraping his skin with a shard of pottery. These were not merely expressions of his grief (though, to be sure, he was grieved) but symbolic statements that he had entered a state of ritual death in a period of mourning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Job now needed a way to move back to ritual life, the ordinary state of affairs. Culturally, “comforters” were the means afforded him for this end, and this explains the efforts of Eliphaz, Bildad, Zophar, and (eventually) Elihu. Each in his way sought to help Job come to terms with his loss, become right with God, and return to ordinary life. Since the three each embraced both the so-called “retribution principle” and its corollary—that God rewards the righteous and punishes the wicked, and that accordingly prosperity and suffering are indicators of righteousness and wickedness respectively—they all tried to convince Job that he ought to repent of his apparent sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notably, however, none could persuade Job of any sin warranting such suffering as he endured, and moreover the book agrees with Job: the narrative prologue first chapters tells us that Job was “blameless and upright” and that “in all this [his initial response to loss] he did not sin.” Job’s bitter response midway through the book (“Miserable comforters are you all!”) makes perfect sense in this context: they were not relieving him of his state of ritual death, for their words offered no way forward. Thus, Job increasingly turns away from answering his friends to pleading with God to appear and answer him, though as Job acknowledges, no one can contend with God. Still: even against the largely accurate answers Elihu provides in chapters 32–36, Job was unmoved. He needed something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When God appears, he does not answer Job’s questions, but neither does he accuse him of sin. Rather, he shows Job his wisdom, and how greatly his wisdom exceeds Job’s understanding. This, it seems, &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; what Job needed in order to move from mourning back to life. He is able to say, “Before, I had heard of you, but now my eyes have seen you,” and &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; is what triggers his return to normal life at the end of the book. Moreover, his statement of repentance in Job 42 makes a great deal more sense this way: he now turned away (“repented” in the bare sense) &lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt; dust and ashes—not repenting of some unnamed sin &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; dust and ashes. Indeed, this (the common reading) would hardly make sense, given that Job immediately puts off his dust and ashes and returns to his life. Job was able to move from ritual death to ritual life because he had encountered God. As a result, Job did return to all the ordinary parts of life. Whereas the mourner was forbidden from feasting, worshipping, and sexual activity, Job participates in all three in the conclusion of the book. His friends and family come and eat with him. He offers sacrifice for his friends. He fathers more children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, taking Job in light of ancient near eastern mourning ritual helps us understand the book’s message and structure far more clearly than taking it as a theodicy. The text does not seek to answer why God allows evil. Indeed, it inverts the question: who are we to think we could understand? In Job we have instead a recognition that the only thing that will really satisfy the soul of one experiencing the deep suffering that life brings is an encounter with the living God. The only thing that could move Job from ritual death to ritual life is the only thing that can move us from spiritual death to spiritual life—not mere academic knowledge of facts about God, but encountering him as one who may be known.&lt;/p&gt;

Besides reading all of the historical books last semester for my Old Testament I survey class and all of the wisdom literature and prophets this semester for my Old Testament II survey class, I am also reading through the Psalms and the Proverbs regularly (I expect to cover the Psalms twice and the Proverbs at least ten times this year), and going over various parts of the New Testament as well. Among other things, this really helps me see the bigger picture and integrate my readings more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, I am increasingly convinced that many evangelicals need not more of the detailed word studies of which we are so fond,&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; but a broader understanding of the ways that the various books and parts of books fit into their canonical and salvation-historical contexts. We need to understand the epistle to Titus, for example, not just as a series of instructions for polity disconnected from salvation history (apart from the parts where Paul refers to salvation history) but as an integral part of that history. The same is true of books we often find difficult to integrate into such a reading, especially the wisdom literature but even including the Psalms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; Paul’s letter to Titus fit into the rest of the canon, and into salvation history? We have of course one of Paul’s typically succinct and incisive summaries of the gospel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when the goodness and loving kindness of God our Savior appeared, he saved us, not because of works done by us in righteousness, but according to his own mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit, whom he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior, so that being justified by his grace we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life. (Titus 3:4-7, ESV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even beyond this explicit pointer to salvation history, though, we must recognize that the book sits in the canon as it does for a reason. We are meant to learn from the needs of the early church, and to remember that the work of God did not stop with the ascension of Christ, nor even with the apostles. We are meant to come away both understanding how we ought to do things ourselves in our own churches better and understanding what God is about in the church more clearly. Paul gets at this quite explicitly, albeit briefly, along the way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation for all people, training us to renounce ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives in the present age, waiting for our blessed hope, the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ, who gave himself for us to redeem us from all lawlessness and to purify for himself a people for his own possession who are zealous for good works. (Titus 2:11-14, ESV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The church exists not only as a lifeboat for those drowning in their sins (though of course it is that), but as a distinctive, united group of people called together to live in a specific way. We are called to live in a particular way, to be a peculiar people: self-controlled, upright, and godly. Jesus gave himself for us&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; not only to pay for our sins, but to make something new of us. He redeemed us from lawlessness; no more should we walk in our own ways. He purified us for himself as a people—not merely a disparate group of persons, but as a united people who are characterized above all by belonging to him. Moreover, as a people we are to be &lt;em&gt;zealous&lt;/em&gt; for good works. As I wrote &lt;a href="/2014/work-hard.html"&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, this is a view we could use a great deal more of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to see clearly our own place in salvation history. We are not people saved in the abstract, or saved as lone-standing individuals, or so that we may have license to do whatever we like. We have been saved with an end in mind: that we might do good and so make much of Christ in the world around us. The result, as Paul points out elsewhere in the book, will be that people will have no cause to revile us and may be led to repentance. In short, we are part of God’s work in history, and our Spirit-empowered pursuit of corporate and personal holiness and good works in the world we inhabit is an important, meaningful part of that work in history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;section class="footnotes"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I might also point out that, from a linguistics perspective, the idea of “word studies” is fundamentally broken. Think about all the ways that the word “conceive” is used, for example—it would be a fallacy to think that every time we use the word in its cognitive sense, we mean to include all the connotations of a child coming into a being. We inevitably indulge in many such fallacies in our usual approach to word studies, and the amount of technical language skill needed to avoid such things is high. I usually recommend that people simply not do word studies at all for this reason alone—but there are other good reasons, too, not least that such studies tend to distract us from the point being made in a particular place as we try to see what the words mean in all the &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; places. That, too, misunderstands how language works.&lt;a href="#fnref1"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I find it telling that Paul says Jesus &lt;em&gt;gave&lt;/em&gt; himself for us rather than only that he &lt;em&gt;died&lt;/em&gt; for us. We know from Philippians that the Son gave to us in the act of the Incarnation as well as in his death.&lt;a href="#fnref2"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

As soon as he has finished his theological foundation in Romans— the most lengthy of any such argument he makes in any of his letters—he moves immediately into some remarkably profound exhortations. They are worth quoting at length and pondering at length:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let love be genuine. Abhor what is evil; hold fast to what is good. Love one another with brotherly affection. Outdo one another in showing honor. Do not be slothful in zeal, be fervent in spirit, serve the Lord. Rejoice in hope, be patient in tribulation, be constant in prayer. Contribute to the needs of the saints and seek to show hospitality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse them. Rejoice with those who rejoice, weep with those who weep. Live in harmony with one another. Do not be haughty, but associate with the lowly. Never be wise in your own sight. Repay no one evil for evil, but give thought to do what is honorable in the sight of all. If possible, so far as it depends on you, live peaceably with all. Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave it to the wrath of God, for it is written, “Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord.” To the contrary, “if your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink; for by so doing you will heap burning coals on his head.” Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good. (Romans 12:9–21)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This list of exhortations is stunning in its breadth and depth. It is impossibly difficult. We could easily become discouraged, and recognizing our own hypocrisy despair and give up,&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; but this was clearly not Paul’s intent. Rather, he was setting before his audience—and thus, before us—a picture of the true Christian life and calling us to pursue it. He was no fool; he had spent much of the book discussing the very challenges that face every would-be follower of God and knew well the weakness of our own flesh. Moreover, immediately after this list, he turned from these instructions to deal with the kinds of weaknesses that have come up in every congregation from his day to ours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul knew we would fail at this list, yet he gave it to us anyway. The authors of the New Testament do not shy away from this move. Jesus told us flatly that we must be perfect as our heavenly father is perfect, and the apostles picked up this theme and ran with it. Why in the world would they do this, knowing we would never meet such a standard (most of all our Lord, who alone has lived righteously)? Is this merely more Law designed to point us back to the Gospel and show us that even as believers, we can do nothing, or are these real instructions—and if the latter, how are we to respond without being crushed by our inability?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the latter: a geniuine call to a righteous life. The idea that these kinds of instructions exist &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; to point us back to the gospel does not do justice to the text, and in fact leads us fairly quickly to a quiet antinominianism. Where we think that we are unable to fulfill God’s law and that even aiming to do so is somehow wrong, we quickly stop pursuing real holiness. This cannot be right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the problem remains: even for the faithful Christian who &lt;em&gt;wants&lt;/em&gt; to fulfill these commands, we recognize our failure. Here, the gospel &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the answer—just not in the way so many antinomian-tending believers take it. The gospel reminds us first of what Christ Jesus has done on our behalf and removes the weight of thinking that we must meet these standards to stand before a righteous God. We never could. We can stand before him only because we are clothed with the righteousness of the Incarnate Son of God who clothed himself in all our sins and bore every drop of the Godhead’s wrath on our sin already. Second, the gospel reminds us that we are &lt;em&gt;presently&lt;/em&gt; united with Christ by the indwelling of his Spirit. The Spirit that raised Christ from the dead—the third person of the Trinity who empowered Jesus to perform his earthly ministry without sinning—lives in us. It is God who works in us both to will and work for his good pleasure. Third, we remember that we have an advocate before the throne of the Father who is always interceding for us, and that the Spirit prays for us when we do not know how to pray for ourselves.&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; We have not been left alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we look at the gospel over and over again, and in so doing are empowered to press on when we do not love perfectly, when we are wise in our sight, when we fail to do what we ought and when we do what we ought not to do. We remember what Christ has done, how he stands now before the Father on our behalf, and how we will stand righteous in him come the final day.&lt;a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; We remember how the Spirit indwells us and empowers us just as he did Christ. We remember that we &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; been raised with Christ even as we &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; be raised with Christ. And we can press on. We can work hard, knowing God is at work in us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was talking with an acquaintance recently who took precisely this course. It broke my heart. We need not despair.&lt;a href="#fnref1"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do not miss this! All Christians have two members of the Trinity always speaking to the third on our behalf, and the third is delighting to respond!&lt;a href="#fnref2"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn3"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A small point of wonder: the final day will also be the &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt; day in many ways. It will be the end of this age, and the beginning of an age without sorrow or tears or calamity. Hallelujah.&lt;a href="#fnref3"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

Word for word, I am hard pressed to think of any other document with such depths. Not for nothing has it often been called the greatest letter ever written. Paul’s incredible intellect is on full display throughout the letter, dedicated entirely to one end: that his readers would see and delight in the work of God in Jesus, the Jewish Messiah through whom salvation came to all nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read Romans 4–6 tonight, and I hardly know where to begin in responding to all the truths layered throughout these chapters. Paul spends most of these first chapters dwelling on the doctrine of justification. &lt;em&gt;How,&lt;/em&gt; he asks, &lt;em&gt;can unrighteous people stand before a holy God? And how can a holy God let them?&lt;/em&gt; These are not new questions for the Scriptures—they are, in some sense, some of the &lt;em&gt;oldest&lt;/em&gt;. From the moment that Adam and Eve disobeyed God and ate of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and in so doing sundered themselves from their maker, God has been showing mercy and restraint toward we people who are ever in rebellion against him. He made a way for often-failing Israel to nonetheless be in a covenant relationship with him throughout the Old Testament years, and he laid out the pattern: blood for blood, life for life, every sin requiring payment. Yet the blood of bulls and goats was not exactly a perfect substitute for a human being. God passed over sins because he was merciful and kind and longsuffering—but he is also just, and justice must be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is with all this as a(n often-referenced) backdrop that Paul lays out his doctrine of justification. Having shown in chapter 3 that Jesus is the answer to the problem of sinful people standing before a righteous God, Paul arcs out and back again over and over again through these chapters to the glorious reality that in Christ, we stand perfectly justified before God. God counts us righteous because Christ was righteous on our behalf, died on our behalf, and was raised on our behalf.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul goes out to Abraham’s justification by faith in God, hammering away at any notion that Abraham was justified by his circumcision or any other good deed and pointing instead to his trust in God, born out by obedience. Then he arcs back in to look at Jesus’ death and resurrection and our response of faith. Then he zooms back out again to the history of salvation in Adam’s trespass and back in to Christ’s work to redeem humanity in every way that it was cursed in Adam. In chapter 6, he applies these truths at a doctrinal level: justification is not license to sin, but grounds for and the basis of empowerment to obey. Paul returns to this theme at length in the end of the book, but he wants it made clear here: the death and resurrection of Christ do not give us cause to embrace antinomianism, but instead lead us to the obedience of faith, just as it did in Abraham.&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this discussion of what Paul says—good though it is—can mask the beauty and the magnificence of his proclamations, though. As John Piper has commented: the God revealed in these pages is worthy of more than mere intellectual analysis. He must be proclaimed, and Paul is proclaiming him—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romans 4:24–25:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be counted to us who believe in him who raised from the dead Jesus our Lord, who was delivered up for our trespasses and raised for our justification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romans 5:6–11:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For while we were still weak, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly. For one will scarcely die for a righteous person—though perhaps for a good person one would dare even to die—but God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. Since, therefore, we have now been justified by his blood, much more shall we be saved by him from the wrath of God. For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, now that we are reconciled, shall we be saved by his life. More than that, we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romans 6:5–11:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we shall certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his. We know that our old self was crucified with him in order that the body of sin might be brought to nothing, so that we would no longer be enslaved to sin. For one who has died has been set free from sin. Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him. We know that Christ, being raised from the dead, will never die again; death no longer has dominion over him. For the death he died he died to sin, once for all, but the life he lives he lives to God. So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christ is risen from the dead! He has trampled down sin and death. He has made atonement for us. He has been born and lived and died a man, tempted like us in every respect yet without sin, but dying he did not stay dead! He has been declared the Son of God with power (Romans 1:4) and raised from the dead to show the surety of our faith and our hope. Hallelujah!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="refs" class="references"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;section class="footnotes"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Romans 4:25 is one of those verses that surprises we crucicentric evangelicals: it says that Jesus was delivered up (i.e. to the cross) for our trespasses and &lt;em&gt;raised&lt;/em&gt; for our justification. We have no justification before God apart from Jesus’ resurrection from the dead. Indeed, the resurrection of Christ is woven through Romans as one of the central themes, too often overlooked by evangelicals, from the very introduction of the book (cf. Romans 1:4).&lt;a href="#fnref1"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This theme of obedience also runs throughout the book. Again, evangelicals can be quick to point to the idea that we are saved by faith, apart from any work of the law, and given the rest of the book of Romans, this is a truth we heartily embrace, and in which we should rejoice. But the faith in view, as James reminds us in his epistle, is not a sort of abstract, intellectual affirmation or an emotional rush of good feeling toward God. It is belief that produces obedience; if it does not produce obedience, &lt;em&gt;it is not real faith and we remain unjustified&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;a href="#fnref2"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

Nearly every major heresy the church confronts (and no few of its littler skirmishes) revolve around issues of the nature of the Incarnate Son of God. From the earliest days of the church, there has been a tension between those emphasizing Jesus’ humanity at the cost of his deity and those emphasizing his deity at the cost of his humanity. The clear testimony of Scripture, however, is that Jesus was everything that it is to be God and also everything that it is to be human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we say, then, that in the Incarnation the Son of God ‘took his flesh from Mary’, we are emphasizing that he inherited from her all that it means to be a human being. Nothing was missing or absent. The Word who was from the beginning, and through whom the Father created the world, and indeed for whom the world exists, took upon himself human body and soul/mind/spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He participated fully in all the weaknesses of human existence. He became subject to common colds and the need to expel waste from his body. He experienced teething pains, and he needed to eat and sleep. He experienced real temptation to sin, more fully than has any other human because he resisted it to the last. He bore the sorrows of life in a world filled with suffering and war and death. He was in everything the word means &lt;em&gt;human&lt;/em&gt;. As the author of Hebrews puts it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since therefore the children share in flesh and blood, he himself likewise partook of the same things, that through death he might destroy the one who has the power of death, that is, the devil, and deliver all those who through fear of death were subject to lifelong slavery. For surely it is not angels that he helps, but he helps the offspring of Abraham. Therefore he had to be made like his brothers in every respect, so that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people. For because he himself has suffered when tempted, he is able to help those who are being tempted. (Hebrews 2:14–18)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We share in flesh and blood; he shared in flesh and blood. He became like us in every respect—not partially, not in some respects, but in every respect. He suffered when he was tempted; the lures and draws of the world did not simply pass by him without any challenge whatsoever. He took from Mary &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; about humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This matters because, as the Fathers pointed out, what he has not assumed has not been redeemed. Redemption is more than (though of course not less than) propitiation for sins. It is the re-uniting of humanity with God, so that all the myriad ways in which human nature has been broken may be set once again how it ought to be. It is the restoration of &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the things that were broken in humanity by the Fall. There is no part of humanity that was not broken by the Fall, no part that does not need restoration, no part that was not cut off from fellowship with God. Thus, there is no part of humanity that is not in need of redemption, and so anything the Son did not take up of our humanity when he became Jesus the Christ is still broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Jesus had only the mind of God and not a human mind, then our minds are still unredeemed. If Jesus’ body was not the Son’s body but a drone-like extension of his will, then our minds remain unredeemed. If Jesus’ will was not a human will but purely and only a divine will, then our wills remain unredeemed. In each case, if Jesus was not both God and man in his nature, we are lost. In this sense, then, few things are of more theological import than the nature of the incarnation. The cross and resurrection, powerful though they are, do not have their intended effect of redeeming lost women and men unless the Incarnation was the complete joining of God and man in Jesus. And so: praise be to God! For when Jesus took his flesh from Mary, he took up humanity whole and entire, leaving nothing out, and joined it with his deity whole and entire, leaving nothing out. So now we through him participated in the divine nature (2 Peter 1:4), just as he participated in human nature.&lt;/p&gt;

The central passage is Romans 5:12–14:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because all sinned—for sin indeed was in the world before the law was given, but sin is not counted where there is no law. Yet death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those whose sinning was not like the transgression of Adam, who was a type of the one who was to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic historic, orthodox&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; views of this position may be summarized as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All humans are guilty of Adam’s sin because they were in his loins when he sinned, and so have not only been contaminated with his sinful nature but also actively sinned when he sinned, and so are guilty and under judgment of death from their very conception—a position most famously and forcefully articulated by Augustine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All humans are born guilty of Adam’s sin because he acted as the federal head of the human race and so we are imputed guilty in him, just as when we partipate in the humanity of the new federal head of humanity—Jesus Christ—his righteousness is imputed to us. In this view, humans are born subject to the punishment of sin (including death) because all of us are &lt;em&gt;counted&lt;/em&gt; guilty in Adam, just as we experience the blessings of holiness when in Christ because we are &lt;em&gt;counted&lt;/em&gt; righteous in him (the historic Reformed view).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All humans are born innocent of Adam’s guilt, but by dint of descent from him have the same corrupted sinful nature he did, and therefore all &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; sin and incur guilt before a holy God. Furthermore, as Adam’s descendants, all are born separated from God and therefore mortal. In this view, humans are born innocent of guilt but inevitably sin because of their fallen humanity and die because of their separation from God. This is the view articulated by the Baptist Faith and Message 2000.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most basic logic of the passage seems to run most closely in line with this last articulation. Paul argues that “sin came into the world through one man, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because all sinned”. While Augustine and the Reformers both took this latter phrase to mean “all sinned &lt;em&gt;in Adam&lt;/em&gt;” it must be recognized that the idea that all sinned “in Adam” is foreign to the text. Indeed, the sentence that follows immediately on the heels of this first declaration suggest that it is individuals’ sins committed in their own lives, and not Adam’s sin, that is in view here. Otherwise, the distinction between the sins that some committed before the law came and the sins that others committed after the law came makes little sense. So likewise does the distinction between Adam’s sin and that of those who followed him, even those whose sin was not like his.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most significant textual challenge to this understanding comes in Paul’s statement that “death spread to all men because all sinned”—a statement that is hard to reconcile with the notion of the lack of conscious sin in infants or the mentally handicapped. Certainly many humans die in infancy, and indeed many die &lt;em&gt;in utero&lt;/em&gt; long before the cognitive ability to make any choice whatsoever has developed. Thus, there is at least some sense in which Paul’s argument entails the death of human beings who have not yet come under condemnation for their own sin because of Adam’s sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of the views outlined above resolve this tension perfectly. The Augustinian view seems overly bound up in Augustine’s views on sexual intercourse as the means of the transmission of sin to human nature. The federal headship view places more emphasis on the idea of imputation than this passage seems to support, but deals forthrightly with the issue of death in the lives of those who have committed no sins. The idea that humans are born innocent of specific guilt but subject to a sin nature that leads inevitably to sin seems to do justice to the basic flow of Paul’s argument, but struggles with the application of death to those who have not sinned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Integrating the latter two options seems the best solution. People die because Adam corrupted human nature, and all participate in his corrupted human nature—a nature separated from the fellowship with God essential to human immortality—unless united to a &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; human nature. People are guilty for their own sins, not for Adam’s, but they die because they share Adam’s basic nature, which came out of his guilt. In due time, they themselves sin they &lt;em&gt;earn&lt;/em&gt; the death in which they already shared by dint of their broken humanity. Even this solution, it must be admitted, remains somewhat messier than we might like, but it is to be preferred as best dealing with all the evidence before us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I leave aside non-orthodox positions such as the Pelagian view that people are born able to live perfectly righteous lives, with uncorrupted natures, which runs against the clear teaching of Scripture that all sin and moreover that all &lt;em&gt;inevitably&lt;/em&gt; sin because of the fallenness of our humanity.&lt;a href="#fnref1"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

Div.</category><category>SEBTS</category></item><item><title>The Name of Sin</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/the-name-of-sin.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Sin is described in various ways in the Old and New Testaments, and these various descriptions and names tell us much about how the authors of the Bible conceived of the power than enslaves us apart from Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Old Testament has several terms its authors often use to describe the broad concept of sin:&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘avah&lt;/em&gt;, meaning “bent” or “crooked”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘aval&lt;/em&gt;, which includes the idea of a lack of integrity, so is often given as “iniquity”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘avar&lt;/em&gt;, meaning “to cross over” or “transgress”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;ra‘&lt;/em&gt;, meaning “the rule of evil”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;ma‘al&lt;/em&gt;, meaning “breach of trust”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;pasha‘&lt;/em&gt;, meaning “to revolt” or “refuse subjection to a rightful authority”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From these we see that humanity’s brokenness before God in the Old Testament was often conceived of in terms of doing things the wrong way, or in rejection of the rightful authority, or a mix of the two. Rebellion against the creator and his created order are essential ingredients of the concept of sin for the Old Testament authors. To do evil is to be in rebellion against the right way God established for things to be done, to reject his &lt;em&gt;shalom&lt;/em&gt; and replace it with destruction and disharmony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most common term for sin in the Old Testament, however, and the one usually translated into the English “sin” is &lt;em&gt;chatha&lt;/em&gt;, meaning “to miss the mark”. Sinning was thus not necessarily always a matter of active, willful rejection of God. It was also simply failing, by dint of corrupted human nature, to do as God called humanity to do, in any and all spheres of life. Sin was thus a pervasive and corrupting influence on &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of human existence, not only on those who were consciously rebelling against God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, the New Testament picks up on many of these same ideas. Though the specific terms used have different semantic ranges than those in the Old Testament, as a group they cover much of the same territory:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;parabasis&lt;/em&gt;, “the transgression of a boundary”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;parakoe&lt;/em&gt;, “disobedience to a voice”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;paraptoma&lt;/em&gt;, “falling where one should have stood upright”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;agnoema&lt;/em&gt;, “failing to know what one should have known”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;hettema&lt;/em&gt;, “diminishing what should have been fully rendered”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;anomia&lt;/em&gt;, failing to observe a law&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;plemmeleia&lt;/em&gt;, “a discord in the harmonies of God’s universe”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the Old Testament range, they add this final notion of discord in the created order—a concept that was present in the Old Testament, to be sure, in the notion of lost &lt;em&gt;shalom&lt;/em&gt;, but which was not so directly expressed. Again, as in the Old Testament, these emphasize both failure to do and active rejection of what is right. And, as in the Old Testament, the New Testament authors’ concept of sin is most commonly expressed in a single word meaning “missing the mark”: &lt;em&gt;hamartia&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This congruence between the Old and New Testament views of sin emphasizes the fundamental unity between the various authors’ understanding of the issues at stake. Sin is everything about humanity’s failure to follow God’s ways and live in accord with his design for the universe. It encompasses the whole range of human foibles, from accidental failure and ignorance to the kind of rebellion that shakes its fist at the heavens or boldly (and foolishly) proclaims that there is no God. Sin is getting it wrong—or, to put it another way that better captures the breadth of Scriptural language on the issue, not getting it &lt;em&gt;perfectly&lt;/em&gt; right, for whatever reason.&lt;/p&gt;

If he ate from that tree, however, he would die the very day he ate of it (Genesis 2:17). When, in Genesis 3, Adam and Eve ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, however, they did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; die—at least, not physically. Indeed, Adam lived to be over nine hundred years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What, then, did God mean when he told Adam that he would sure die the very day he ate of the tree? Did he lie, or make a mistake, or change his mind after the fact? Plainly put, no: none of these are true. Rather, all of them mistake the nature of the death entailed in God’s word to Adam. The death Adam immediately experienced was not physical death but spiritual death. Physical death was a consequence—a symptom, as it were—of his spiritual death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This spiritual death was multifold, and we see the various elements of it traced out in the explanation of the fall given in Genesis 3. First of all came separation from God. Rather than being in right relationship with the creator, Adam now needed restoration. Whereas he had enjoyed fellowship and relationship with his maker, now Adam experienced fear at the thought of encountering him, so that he hid himself when God came walking in the garden in the cool of the day. The rest of the Old Testament traces this theme out in great detail; it is constantly asking the question, “How may these unrighteous people come before a holy God?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, God removed Adam from the means of grace he had supplied to sustain his mortal body. He had provided a tree of life from which Adam could eat so that his body would go on living without fail. After the fall, Adam was removed from this supply, and so his body began to fall apart. He began to experience the first phase of physical death: aging and decay. He no longer had access to the supernatural sustenance he required not to die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, he immediately experienced relational brokenness. The previously holy and mutually delightful relationship he had experienced with his wife would now be characterized by mutual blame and recriminations. Likewise, his sons would not be loving brothers: one would kill the other. No more would he live in a world characterized by peace and harmony, but one shaped by conflict and war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of all of these, though, it was the first that was most important and deepest. Adam’s separation from God was at the root of all the other problems he now faced. It was the lack of God’s spirit in him that led to his physical death. It was the lack of God’s presence in their midst, and the brokenness of his image in them, that led men and women to be in conflict rather than mutually supporting one another. With this separation came a warp in the character of humanity that comprised the final part of Adam’s immediate death: no more would his will be ready to obey God. Instead, he (and all his descendants) would be quick to turn aside to go against the grain of God’s universe. Given the opportunity, all would sin, and no one would turn away from sin without God’s intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, Adam &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; experience death the very day, indeed the very moment, that he ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The death was more profound and more horrifying than physical death alone would have been, though, because it was a death that stretched to every point of his life, from his family and the tasks with which God had entrusted him, to his very connection with God. Everything became broken in him, and he no longer knew God. In gaining the knowledge of good and evil, he lost the knowledge of the one of whom knowledge matters most.&lt;/p&gt;

Div.</category><category>SEBTS</category></item><item><title>Call and Response</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/call-and-response.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;The ways in which the Bible draws on itself are sometimes astounding. A case in point: as is so often the case in my readings, the New Testament reading seems almost as though drawing explicitly on the Old Testament reading. I should note: I am not following a lectionary or any particular plan, so it is not as though this is an intentional thing. Indeed, my reading plan right now is basically: Psalms, Proverbs, wherever I need to be reading for my Old Testament survey class, and wherever I feel like reading in the New Testament. Not particularly complicated! The reason is simpler than a formal plan: it is that the authors were aware of each other, and later authors clearly drew quite consciously on the material left behind by those who went before them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A case in point: Romans 1–3 and Psalm 53 both show us the state of humanity quite clearly. They get there in different ways, of course. The Psalm arrives by way of poetic rhythm and the steadily building refrain that there are those who reject God, culminating in the expectation of judgment on the enemies of God and blessings for his people (typical enough themes of the Psalms, in some ways.) In his letter to Rome, Paul builds up this notion by carefully measured argument (which is not to suggest any lack of &lt;em&gt;verve&lt;/em&gt; in said argument—this is Paul we are talking about!) until he comes to the oft-cited and less-often-really-grasped reality that “all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God” (Romans 3:23).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was most striking about Psalm and epistle alike to me was not only their congruity on the state of humanity, but also their agreement on the answer to that problem. (This is not &lt;em&gt;surprising&lt;/em&gt;. Just &lt;em&gt;striking&lt;/em&gt;. Note well the difference between the two!) Both look not to human accomplishment or restitution for undone deeds and deeds that ought to have been left undone, but to the God who can save his people. The Psalmist cried out, praying, “Oh, that salvation for Israel would come out of Zion!” (Psalm 53:6). Paul answers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart from the law, although the Law and the Prophets bear witness to it—the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe. For there is no distinction: for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, to be received by faith. This was to show God’s righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins. It was to show his righteousness at the present time, so that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then what becomes of our boasting? It is excluded. By what kind of law? By a law of works? No, but by the law of faith. For we hold that one is justified by faith apart from works of the law. Or is God the God of Jews only? Is he not the God of Gentiles also? Yes, of Gentiles also, since God is one—who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through faith. (Romans 3:21-30)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salvation &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; come for Israel, from Israel, but not only to Israel. Salvation came also to the nations. For that, I am profoundly grateful: &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; am the nations, as is almost everyone reading this. We stood condemned under the law of our conscience just as the Jewish people stood condemned by the law God had given them. All of us stood in desperate need of intervention, and so God intervened. All peoples sin, and all peoples&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are justified by God’s grace. God is perfectly just, and he does not just overlook sin. He judges it. But he has judged it &lt;em&gt;in Christ&lt;/em&gt;, and not in you or me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hallelujah.&lt;/p&gt;

First and foremost, wisdom is a matter of walking with Yahweh, in accord with his revelation of himself. Verses 3–4 make this abundantly clear, echoing as they do Moses’ words to Israel in giving them the law. Just as the people of God were to bind his law on their bodies and their hearts, so the author of the Proverbs exhorts his son to remember “steadfast love and faithfulness”—the very attributes with which Yahweh characterized himself in that climactic moment on the mountain in &lt;cite class="bibleref"
title="Ex 34.6"&gt;Exodus 34&lt;/cite&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So although some scholars have asserted that the Proverbs (and indeed the rest of the literature) developed totally separately from the Law of Israel, such a proposition looks to me more like wishful thinking on the part of secularists than an accurate acknowledgement of the shape of the text. Proverbs is not separate from the Torah. It is &lt;em&gt;commentary&lt;/em&gt; on the Torah. Indeed, there is no part of the moral Law given to Israel that does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; come up for discussion in the course of the book. Worshipping Yahweh is front and center. Murder and adultery both come in for repeated admonition. Rejection of not only covetousness and envy but also of the roots beneath them is pervasive. To put it as Dr. Heath Thomas did in my Old Testament class several weeks ago: the Torah told Israel &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; to do, and the Proverbs taught them &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Proverbs 3 sits as part of this project. Its famous admonition to trust Yahweh and not to lean on one’s own understanding is one of the lynchpins of the book.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The whole book must be taken in light of this admonition. Human wisdom is not God’s wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is no coincidence that the author of the book turns almost immediately from exhorting his audience to trust in Yahweh rather than in human wisdom to a picture of divine wisdom. Nor is it mere happenstance that he includes the notion that Yahweh created the earth &lt;em&gt;by&lt;/em&gt; wisdom and established the heavens &lt;em&gt;by&lt;/em&gt; understanding.&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; This is essential to understanding the shape and argument of Proverbs. God made the world to work in a certain way, and we either walk in that way or we do not. The way we have chosen—our broken, sinful path—is not in line with the way the universe was designed. The way he has set before us—the way of reconciliation in Christ Jesus—is the way of shalom. And Proverbs thus is a guide for the Christian for what it means to follow Christ. It is the light to our path as we seek to keep God’s law, recognizing that he who made all things has also shown us how to walk in line with the way he made those things—indeed, with how he made &lt;em&gt;us&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why we should not lean on our own understanding: because it is not only flawed, but forever incomplete. Even when we are sanctified—perhaps &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; when we are sanctified—we will not lean on our own understanding, but rest in the wisdom of the one who &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; wisdom, and who shaped the universe to his wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="refs" class="references"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;section class="footnotes"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, I would note, the key to understanding the entire book of Ecclesiastes. If we take Proverbs 3:5–8 as a guide and then we read Ecclesiastes, the problem that &lt;em&gt;Qoheleth&lt;/em&gt; had becomes clear rather quickly, and then is reiterated throughout that book: the Preacher trusted his own wisdom instead of God’s. Proverbs is the foundational text for biblical wisdom, and other wisdom books must be understood in light of it.&lt;a href="#fnref1"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is impossible not to note the connection that New Testament authors made to this concept in Christ, from John’s description of Jesus as the &lt;em&gt;Logos&lt;/em&gt;—which has in its semantic range not only the idea of “word” but of “reason”—to Paul’s straightforward declaration that “Christ Jesus… became for us wisdom from God” (1 Cor. 1:30), and to the New Testament’s oft-repeated refrain that Christ was the agent of creation (cf. Col. 1:16, Heb. 1:10–12, 2:10).&lt;a href="#fnref2"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

Here, David’s extended prayer of repentance and supplication to God has long seemed a good model for my own prayers of like kind, and so it is—but there is more to see in this passage than a model for us. While the question, &lt;em&gt;Is there something to imitate (or something &lt;/em&gt;not* to imitate) in this passage?* is a good one, there is always another fruitful question to ask of any text in the Bible: &lt;em&gt;What does this tell us about the person and nature of God himself?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can often be easy to let this question fall aside, and not only in the Psalms. The temptation to miss this central issue in Scripture is no less strong when working through narratives like those in Acts. In both cases, however, we must remind ourselves that the scriptures are not merely the record of man’s response to God: they are God’s revelation of himself to man. That distinction will prevent us from running off in all sorts of unhelpful directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Psalm 51, I learned today not only what a contrite response to God looks like, but many things about the character of God himself. First and foremost, in inspiring the editor of the Psalms to place this particular song of repentance in the Bible at all, God emphasizes to us the need for real repentance. This theme is doubly clear given the organization of the Psalms. David says here just as Asaph had said in Psalm 50: God does not delight in burnt offerings in and of themselves, but he does delight in hearts that worship God (cf. Psalm 50:8–12, 51:16–17). In fact, the two Psalms together make it abundantly clear that God detests sacrifices offered &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; the right heart—a theme that appears time and again not only in the Psalms but also throughout the Prophets. God is not the sort of being who is appeased by getting fragrant smoke or the scent of barbecue in his nostrils.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; He is instead the kind of being who is pleased by genuine repentance—turning from evil to righteousness, and by righteousness we must mean dependence on him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Psalm also draws forth several more salient points about the character of God in the structure of the prayer. If God calls us to imitate this prayer, as indeed he does, then it is because it speaks rightly and reflects right thought about him. So we can take away from it that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;he has mercy on people according to his steadfast love, and out of that mercy he “blots out” our transgressions (Ps. 51:1,9)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;he washes people of iniquity and cleanses us from our sin—not only &lt;em&gt;forgiving&lt;/em&gt; our sin, but also &lt;em&gt;removing&lt;/em&gt; it from us (Ps. 51:2,7)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;he is the one against whom all sin finally is committed—even our sins against others are also sins against him (Ps. 51:4)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;he is (and ought to be seen as) fully justified in his words&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and blameless in his judgment—that is, that the way he rules and judges are completely right, and no one can have cause to find fault with them (Ps. 51:4)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;he delights in truth in the depths of our souls, and by implication hates hypocrisy (Ps. 51:6)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;he is the source of wisdom (Ps. 51:6)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;he is the source of any joy and gladness we have, &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; when we confront our own sin (Ps. 51:8,12)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;he is the one who can and does give us clean hearts and right spirits where we have fouled our own hearts and broken our spirits (Ps. 51:10)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;he may be far from us and may take his Spirit from us, but he desires that we be near to him and filled with his Spirit (Ps. 51:11)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;he upholds us (Ps. 51:12)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;he delivers us from guilt (Ps. 51:14)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;his goodness ought to be proclaimed to others and he ought to be praised (Ps. 51:13,14–15)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;he does not despise broken-heartedness or contrition—as did, say, the Greek philosophers (Ps. 51:17)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the end of the Psalm highlights that personal repentance has corporate consequences, and so reminds us that God’s work in our lives is not about us alone. He is at work in his people. His work in restoring David impacted Zion/Jerusalem. David’s prayer did not stop with his own being set in right relation with God, but extended to the people of God being in right relation with God as well. The king &lt;em&gt;ought&lt;/em&gt; to have such a concern for his people—and here we have a pointer to the greater king who not only had such a concern but who achieved it himself once and for all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glory to God, and thanksgiving to him for his self-revelation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be sure, the Old Testament sacrificial system did please God—he instituted it!—and it culminated in the sacrifice of God the Son on our behalf. But as the author Hebrews makes clear: the burnt offerings of the Old Testament were never sufficient to save, and were always meant to point to something greater than themselves. They were present to teach the Israelites (and us) the necessity of God’s salvation, and to point to the greater sacrifice to come.&lt;a href="#fnref1"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Probably including his law and his decrees about life.&lt;a href="#fnref2"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

The book is challenging because it shows Christians facing extraordinary challenges and committing to proclaim Christ no matter the cost to themselves. (In these chapters, for example, Paul is dragged outside the city and stoned, after which he gets up and goes on proclaiming the gospel.) So often I find myself wishing that even the ordinary trials of my life would pass more quickly and am all too quick to complain about them (internally even when I am too socially savvy to do so out loud). Looking at Peter sitting in prison, fully expecting to die at the hands of Herod just as his master had, or at Paul and Barnabas nearly everywhere they went, I am challenged to grow deeper in my own faith and my own commitment to Christ. I am convicted that I ought to complain less and praise God more, that I ought indeed to be thankful to God for the opportunity to show that I value him more than the passing comforts and pleasures of this world (even as I offer heartfelt lament to him at the brokenness of this world).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the record of Acts is encouraging because it is abundantly clear throughout the book that the church advanced because the Spirit of God was empowering otherwise ordinary men and women to do great things for him. As Paul himself put it to a crowd who tried to worship him and Barnabas, “We are also men!” (Acts 14:15). As extraordinary as the faith these men and women demonstrated was, they were just people like you and me who God used. This is encouraging looking at myself, and looking around at the state of the church. Though we are all frail and broken, often quick to seek the world’s favor on the one hand and insular and unwilling to engage the lost on the other, hesitant and fainting in our proclamation of the gospel, hungry for men’s affirmation over God’s, little in faith, weak or inarticulate in speech, insufficiently thoughtful, unkind and sometimes overly politic, licentious and legalistic—still God can use us, and still it is ultimately he who saves and not we. Paul had his sharp edges, Peter his fear of man, and the early church no small number of legalistic ascetics and licentious antinomians, but God was at work nonetheless. His Spirit drew people to Christ through these earthen vessels, and he is doing the same today. God uses us in spite of our foibles, and in truth sometimes he uses us in the particular ways he does because our foibles highlight that it is he and not we who are really at work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, then, the book of Acts is joyfully humbling. It is convicting of the need for deeper faith, and it is convincing of the need to depend on God. Both of these are cause for joy, though. Deeper faith and greater commitment to make much of Christ will bear great fruit in our lives and in the world around us when it is coupled in greater dependence on the Spirit of God to work rather than on our own techniques. Hallelujah. Go and make disciples.&lt;/p&gt;

They range from Messianic and &lt;a href="/2014/the-city-of-god.html"&gt;Zionic&lt;/a&gt; songs to hymns of ovation and from laments to songs of Ascent. And they include, as here in Psalm 49, wisdom literature not so different from that which we find in Proverbs or Job or Ecclesiastes. Life is brief, these sons of Korah remind us, and when we come to the end of it, we can take nothing with us. No accumulated wealth, no pomp or prosperity, can pass death’s forbidding gates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is especially striking that this comes as part of the Psalmists’ answer to the question of how to respond to the apparent victories of cheaters and evildoers in the world around them. The very point that so perplexed the author of Ecclesiastes—that righteous and unrighteous men alike die when all is said and done—is here a point of comfort to the Psalmists. It is as if the same reality, understood differently, carries with it an entirely different meaning. And so it is. We have here one of the keys to understanding the way that the Scriptures teach us to think about the world in which we live. It is not only that the righteous and the unrighteous both die, coming sometimes without any judgment in this life to the end of their days and so passing away in seeming injustice. It is also that the injustice that they perpetrate does not and cannot endure forever; it will come to an end in the finality with which death greets all our doings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether that end is a cause for despair or for hope comes down to a matter of wisdom. The fool looks and says, “The wicked prosper—I shall join them!” The seemingly wise person looks and says, “The wicked prosper—let us all despair!” The truly wise person looks and says, “The wicked prosper—but not forever!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two notes that are all the more noteworthy in Psalm 49 for the way it otherwise fits into the context of ancient Israelite wisdom literature, and both relate to this same theme of coming death. In verses 7–9, and again in verse 15, there are words that cannot but make the attentive Christian reader think of things beyond the Old Testament’s vision of death. Verses 7–9 remind us:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truly no man can ransom another,&lt;br /&gt;
    or give to God the price of his life,&lt;br /&gt;
for the ransom of their life is costly&lt;br /&gt;
    and can never suffice,&lt;br /&gt;
that he should live on forever&lt;br /&gt;
    and never see the pit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, as I have noted, was a cause for hope for these songwriters, strange though that seems at first blush. But it also speaks to the reality we all face in a way that seemes aimed directly at the hope we see in some of the Prophets and brought fully to light in the New Testament. Someone &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; ransom men and gave to God the price of his life, paid fully the ransom that did suffice so we might live on forever and never see the pit. No man indeed could do this. But God himself could, and did. And the Psalmists seems to have seen this coming (verse 15):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But God will ransom my soul from the power of Sheol,&lt;br /&gt;
    for he will receive me. Selah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is exactly what has happened to us all. God has ransomed our souls from the power of death, and he is the one who will receive us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hallelujah.&lt;/p&gt;

Whether Jesus Christ’s death provided substition for the sins of all people or just some has been the cause of many dissensions and denominational splits in the Protestant world ever since the Reformation. Most famously, Arminius and his followers were expelled from the Calvinistic churches over this very issue and the way they worked out their stance in other areas of doctrine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the most part, though, what is at issue is not whether Jesus’ death was of sufficient merit to save all people. Jesus the incarnate Son of God provided a sacrifice of infinite worth, undoubtedly of sufficient worth to cover all the sins of all mankind in all of history. Rather, the question is to whom the atonement is applied and how—or, to put it differently, to whom its benefits are available. Thus, the phrases of “limited atonement” and “unlimited atonement” are best understood as referring to the availability and effect of the atonement, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to its value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, it must be recognized that all orthodox Christians affirm that the effects of the atonement are limited in at least one important sense: not all people are redeemed, and therefore not all people benefit from the atonement of Christ. To put it as many have before, all orthodox believers affirm that the atonement was “sufficient for all, but efficient for some,” for if it was “efficient” for all, then all would be saved. (To affirm any lesser effect is to diminish the atonement. This is not to say that there may not be other, broader effects of Christ’s death on the cross—e.g. the notion of prevenient grace enabling all to respond to the preached word—only that the atonement itself is not applied universally.) The question then is only who those “some” are and the terms under which the atonement is available to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simplest answer is simply to say, “the elect!” and have done, leaving aside the tendentious question of who is elect—but this question is precisely where the rubber meets the road on the issue of the atonement. After all, everyone agrees that the only the sins of those who believe are actually removed in Christ, regardless of how election works out. Thus, when people speak of “limited” or “unlimited” atonement, they are usually speaking of the issue of general or specific election. Does the work of Christ mean that all are equally able to hear and respond to the gospel, or does it mean that only the elect are enabled to hear and respond?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the most faithful articulation of the matter is to speak of the atonement in three ways. First, we affirm that Jesus’ death was sufficient to atone for the sins of the world—&lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the world. Second, we offer the atonement freely to everyone. Although the only the elect will be saved (however we understand that to play out), the Scriptures clearly enjoin us to proclaim Christ’s subtitutionary death and justifying resurrection to sinners everywhere and to urge everyone to repent and trust in him. Third, we affirm that the saving work of the atonement is applied to the sins of those who confess Christ as Savior and Lord and obey him. We need not perfectly understand or agree upon the means by which people come to confess Christ as Lord to affirm that it is only in that affirmation and obedience that one’s sins are covered in the atonement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is thus most appropriate to speak of Jesus’ atonement as unlimited in extent but limited in effect.&lt;/p&gt;

Div.</category><category>SEBTS</category></item><item><title>Goodbye, Chrome</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/goodbye-chrome.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Last week, Chrome crossed the line for me. I deleted it from my system to clean up its many hooks into my system—I searched out every trace of it I could find—and will put it back on my system only for testing websites. Why? Because it’s just too creepy now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the story: two weekends ago, I was sitting at a coffee shop working on a friend’s website, when up popped a series of Google Now OS X desktop notifications from Chrome, informing me of the weather, a package having recently shipped, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were just two problems with this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I never gave Chrome permission to do anything of the sort.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was not signed into Chrome or any Google service at the time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Number 1 is bothersome. Number 2 is so far beyond bothersome that I took the nuclear option. Let’s walk through them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google apparently decided to start opting people into Google Now on the Chrome 33 Beta. Opting people into anything new is nearly always a bad idea in my view; opting someone into something that actively integrates with email, calendar, etc. without asking them is just creepy. Now, full disclosure: I had previously granted Google access to some of this data for Google Now on my Android phone (though I have since moved to an iPhone). However, as is usual for Google these days, the company took that permission in one context and treated it as global permission in all contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No doubt the box I checked when I gave them access to that data in the first place legally allowed them to continue touching it. That did not particularly bother me. Rather, it was the assumption that I wanted the same kind of interactions from the service in a different context. This is typical of Google —typically un-human-friendly, that is. People do different things with their phones than with their browsers, and have different expectations of what each will do. More importantly, though, even if we might &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; our browsers to start supplying us the kinds of sometimes-valuable information that we get from Google Now (or Apple or Microsoft’s similar tools), we generally want the opportunity to make that decision. Increasingly, Google is making that decision for its users, leaving them to opt out and turn it off if they so desire. That is not a policy I particularly like. So: strike one. Or rather: strike several dozen, of the sort that had me moving away from Google’s services for quite some time— but it probably still wouldn’t have pushed me across the line to this kind of hard kill-it-with-fire mentality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What did? That would be the part where Chrome started sending me desktop Google Now notifications. Without asking me. In a browser to which I was not logged in, nor logged into any Google services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will say that again to be clear: I was not signed into Chrome. I was not signed into any Google services in the browser. I had not allowed the browser to create desktop notifications. And it started sending me Google Now notifications for my main Google account. Worse: nothing I could do with the browser itself changed that behavior. (Unsurprising: there was no way Chrome should have been able to do that in the first place, logged out of all Google services as I was.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goodbye, Chrome. You’re just too creepy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was not the first time I have seen Chrome engage in behavior that does not respect its users. I have repeatedly run into cases where clearing the cache and deleting browsers… doesn’t. Cookies sometimes still stick around. Private browsing sessions inherit cookies from the main window (and sometimes vice versa). Closing a private session and launching a new one would sometimes still include cookies and cache from a previous session (bank accounts still logged in, etc.). Chrome had thus long been untrustworthy to me. But this was a bridge too far. This was not just slightly unnerving. It was creepy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Call it a bug if you like. It is likely that it was, in fact, a bug. So, most likely, were the other cases I saw above. But these are the kinds of bugs that make a browser fundamentally untrustworthy, and they are the kinds of bugs that are that much creepier coming from a company whose profit comes almost entirely from selling advertising—that is, from selling user information to advertising companies. The deal was that we trusted Google not to abuse that information. Unfortunately, that deal just keeps getting worse all the time. (Pray they do not alter it further.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will have a copy of the browser on my system for testing purposes, but for nothing else. Goodbye, Chrome. And for that matter: goodbye, Google services. Over the course of the rest of this year, I will be moving myself completely off of all Google services (mail, calendar, etc.), with the sole exception of (non- logged-in) search. You’re just too creepy now.&lt;/p&gt;

Notably, looking at Psalm 48, the prominence of Zion throughout the Psalms and in this Psalm in particular is striking. It is of course not Zion itself that is the cause for note and rejoicing, but the presence of Yahweh within the city. (The temple in this city is where God makes his dwelling place on earth—a striking thought!) But the city does come in for special notice because Yahweh dwells there, and does so often throughout the Old Testament.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great is the &lt;span class="smcp"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; and greatly to be praised&lt;br /&gt;
    in the city of our God!&lt;br /&gt;
His holy mountain, beautiful in elevation,&lt;br /&gt;
    is the joy of all the earth,&lt;br /&gt;
Mount Zion, in the far north,&lt;br /&gt;
    the city of the great King.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Psalm 48:1–2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The temple of God, his dwelling place with and among us, comes up over and over again throughout the Scriptures. It is there from the very beginning, from Eden where God would walk with his people in the cool of the day. It is there in the end, in the New Jerusalem where the dwelling place of God is with man and there is no temple at all because God himself is the temple. It is here, now, in the time when the people of God have replaced a building and become a temple of living stones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Psalmist’s call to survey Zion (Psalm 48:12–13a) does what all such calls in the Scriptures do: it points the listener to the God whose dwelling place Zion is (48:13b–14). Yahweh will establish this city forever (48:8) as a mark of his triumph over the (rebellious) nations, and as a result his name—that is, knowledge of him and his character—and his praise will fill the ends of the earth. And the end of people coming to this city will be that all will know that “this is our God, / our God forever and ever. He will guide us forever.”&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meditating on Zion—that is, on Jerusalem both old and new—does not seem at first blush a fertile ground for worship. But that is exactly where the Psalmist has taken us. The old Jerusalem was the city that rejected the prophets and finally rejected the prophet like Moses, the promised Davidic king (a point driven home rather forcefully in Stephen’s monologue in Acts 7, which I also read today). Though it was the dwelling place of God, it was also the city that rejected God—much as Adam and Eve had done in Eden. That even so God dwelt there, that even so God dwells with us who are so often so very sinful, is nothing short of astounding. That he will someday bring down a new Jerusalem that he has made, and in which he will be both the spiritual center and the righteous ruler, is the more astounding yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So with the Psalmist, I thank God for his city. And with the Psalmist, I look forward to the day when God shows his glory to all the earth through his city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id="fn2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Forever” here has sometimes been read as “beyond death.” There’s a striking image in the Old Testament, opaque about the fate of men and women after death as it usually is!&lt;a href="#fnref2"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

This was disappointing: I have enjoyed the habit of writing regularly, and I intend to keep it up. As I have often noted in the past (in more blog posts on previous versions of the site than I can count, still less dig up at the moment), writing serves to focus my thoughts as little else does. Moreover, though my &lt;a href="/devotions"&gt;#devotions&lt;/a&gt; posts are not especially excellent as writing goes, the discipline of writing is like many other things: sometimes it matters most that you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; it more than the doing of it be particularly magnificent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of my running is this way. The vast majority of my runs are entirely unexceptional and become notable only in their consistency. They are not tiring and not particularly fast—for me, at least! This is an important qualification, I recognize, though one that is nonetheless closely tied to the very ordinary nature of these runs. They become interesting, and are effective, only in the aggregate. My entire training plan is built on going slowly and training the “easy” side of my physiological response to running. The effect over time is extraordinary, though: my easy runs with a toddler in a stroller today are faster than my best runs alone were a few years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My hope for this year is to do something the same with my writing. I do not expect that the majority of my words will be particularly elegant or well-put-together. I expect most of my posts to go largely unread and unnoticed, and that is perfectly fine with me—indeed, &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; than fine, because I am writing them first of all as a double act of self-discipline. From those devotional posts I hope to gain not an audience but the benefit of thoughtful reflection the Scriptures I read and the helpful effect of regular writing on my &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when, as in the last few days, I simply cannot get to that writing because other things intrude, I have a double response. First, I recognize that this is totally all right, under the circumstances. Jaimie and I have been spending time with friends and each other, and my normal writing times in the evenings have simply been elided by those other activities. Second, though, I recognize that such things are likely to come up often, and as such am motivated to commit once again to doing this writing in the mornings as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For several weeks in the beginning of the semester this spring, I was able to get up, do my reading, and do my writing before I went to class at 8am. A few weeks ago, Jaimie’s grandmother passed away and we flew her out for the funeral, and that weekend completely tossed my habits and schedule out of alignment. Instead of my two normally scheduled tasks for the weekend (school and work), I had three—and one of them in the form of a teething toddler. The other two slipped. I have only just finally caught up, and as such I am hoping that in the week ahead I shall be able to resume my previously very effective habits of doing all these things to &lt;em&gt;start&lt;/em&gt; the day rather than to finish them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That, of course, assumes I get over this blasted cold that I seem to have caught last night… Life is a funny thing, sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;

A group of obviously-still-confused men and women were gathered for prayer, and the Holy Spirit came like fire on them and set the world on its head. The epoch-making change in this group of people is shocking to consider. In Acts 1, only a few weeks earlier, these same disciples had been expecting the resurrected Jesus to restore the kingdom to Israel. This is truly marvelous: Jesus the Christ had risen from the dead, and all his teachings had still not sunk in. They still did not understand that what he was about was the restoration of &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; things, not only the restoration of Israel. This was why they needed the Holy Spirit: although they had been given explanation after explanation, some of them incredibly clear (as to the disciples on the road to Emmaus after Jesus’ resurrection from the dead). It did not matter: they still did not understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then the Holy Spirit came, and as promised (see Acts 1:5 and cf. John 14ff.) the Spirit gave them understanding and wisdom like they could scarcely have imagined before. The external changes are notable in many ways: suddenly these disciples were speaking in languages they did not know and performing astonishing miracles. But the internal changes are what really tell us what happened. Peter and the others transformed from people dominated by fear to people characterized by bold confidence in the Lord—and not just any “lord”, but his Lord Jesus Christ. Likewise, whereas before they had still mistakenly been looking foran earthly rule, Peter and the others now recognized that Christ demanded allegiance no less when reigning beside his father in Heaven than he would have taking up a kingship here on earth. “Repent and believe,” they cry out to all, “and your sins will be forgiven and the Lord God will be your God.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And each of us is filled with this self-same Holy Spirit, the means of the Son’s work for the Father in the Trinity. We have in us the same spirit that raised Jesus Christ from the dead, animated the early church, and has given life to his people ever since. This is not small thing. Indeed, though we tend in intellectual Reformed circles largely to overlook the work of the Spirit, and though our Charismatic brothers tend to emphasize points that Scripture does not, we need to invest more time in understanding the Spirit and his work rightly. But in any case, we have this glorious treasure: Christ formed in us by the very means of the salvation of the world, his Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

Psalm 46 could be a meditation on the prophecies of Revelation 14– 22, in many ways… but of course, this has it backwards. It is not surprising that the Psalms (or indeed almost any other part of the Bible) should sound like a complement to Revelation when held up next to the final book. Reading through Revelation this week hammered home just how familiar John was with the rest of the Bible. Whether he knew the Pauline corpus to quote it is hard to say,&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; but he certainly quotes and alludes to sayings of Jesus that are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; in the gospel of John but are in the other gospels, and of course his command of the Old Testament is astounding. In fact, in many ways, Revelation reads like a summary and recapitulation of the rest of the Bible, set in apocalyptic terms that herald the end of the age and the consummation of all things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revelation can be confusing, to be sure, but after having spent several years away from the book,&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and now coming back to it again much more familiar with the rest of the Bible,&lt;a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; its confusing points dim in light of what is clear to me. That is: for all that John records many visions, he spends at least as much time repeating themes and statements and phrases from the rest of the Scripture, tying together what had previously been disparate elements into a unified whole. In the course of the book, I think John quotes every major prophet and references every (or nearly every) major apocalyptic image presented throughout the Old Testament and many or most of those in the New. He certainly also references Psalms and the Pentateuch; I would feel confident guessing that there are references to the historical writings and wisdom literature that I simply missed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, John’s command of the rest of the Scriptures is simply astounding. John was not only the recipient of visions; he was also a masterful expositor of the word of God. The revelation was given to him, I think, at least in part because he had so thoroughly learned the rest of the Bible and could rightly situate the visions he was given in the rest of salvation history. As each page fills up with quote after quote and allusion after allusion to the rest of the great book of God’s work, Revelation becomes more and more comprehensible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be sure, some of the details remain fuzzy.&lt;a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; But what comes through clearly —not least through the constant references to the rest of Scripture—is that the Lord God, the All-Powerful,&lt;a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; will in the end bring justice on the earth. He will destroy Satan and crush evil and end the cosmic rebellion against the only good and true one. He will establish righteousness and justice and peace on the earth. He will give eternal life to those who worship him. God will dwell with man. Hallelujah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He who testifies to these things says, “Surely I am coming soon.” Amen. Come, Lord Jesus!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all. Amen. (Revelation 22:20–21, ESV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least, for this non-expert who hasn’t explicitly looked for quotes from or allusions to Paul in Revelation.&lt;a href="#fnref1"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last time I read through Revelation was sometime in 2012, I believe, as I read through the whole Bible that year.&lt;a href="#fnref2"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn3"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have spent a great deal of time reading and re-reading the Prophets and the Gospels over the course of 2013 and early 2014.&lt;a href="#fnref3"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn4"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As indeed at least some of them likely did to the original audience; I strongly suspect that we are not &lt;em&gt;meant&lt;/em&gt; to understand perfectly all that is shown in Revelation.&lt;a href="#fnref4"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A rendering I picked up from the &lt;a href="http://lexhamenglishbible.com"&gt;Lexham English Bible&lt;/a&gt;, and which I rather like.&lt;a href="#fnref5"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

That the Psalm was written with an ordinary bride for a normal king of Israel in mind is a trifle mind-boggling, in fact, given how perfectly the Psalm ends up picturing the Messianic realities in which we now live and whose final fulfillment we now await. It is, in short, a perfect picture of how the Holy Spirit superintended the composition of Scripture so that over time (and especially with the Advent of Jesus the Messiah) all the words have been filled up with more meaning.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many Messianic poems in the Psalter, and few (if any) of them were originally written with a clear expectation of a future God-man Messiah. They speak of normal human kings—the “anointed ones” of Israel—in hopeful and prayerful terms, terms that God then filled up in himself when he came and dwelt among us.&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; They speak of the aspirations of Israel that were always dashed on the rocks of human fallibility, and which were finally fulfilled by inversion in a king who died at the hands of oppressors rather than toppling them. They speak of the King who, though his reign has been inaugurated since he rose from that death, has still not put his enemies under his feet. Israel waited, and we wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading the Psalm next to the Revelation given to John only makes these thematic ties more apparent. The Psalmist writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gird your sword on your thigh, O mighty one,&lt;br /&gt;
    in your splendor and majesty!&lt;br /&gt;
In your majesty ride out victoriously&lt;br /&gt;
    for the cause of truth and meekness and righteousness;&lt;br /&gt;
    let your right hand teach you awesome deeds!&lt;br /&gt;
Your arrows are sharp&lt;br /&gt;
    in the heart of the king’s enemies;&lt;br /&gt;
    the peoples fall under you. (Psalm 45:3-5, ESV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And John writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the seventh angel blew his trumpet, and there were loud voices in heaven, saying, “The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ, and he shall reign forever and ever.” And the twenty-four elders who sit on their thrones before God fell on their faces and worshiped God, saying,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We give thanks to you, Lord God Almighty,&lt;br /&gt;
    who is and who was,&lt;br /&gt;
for you have taken your great power&lt;br /&gt;
    and begun to reign.&lt;br /&gt;
The nations raged,&lt;br /&gt;
    but your wrath came,&lt;br /&gt;
    and the time for the dead to be judged,&lt;br /&gt;
and for rewarding your servants, the prophets and saints,&lt;br /&gt;
    and those who fear your name,&lt;br /&gt;
    both small and great,&lt;br /&gt;
and for destroying the destroyers of the earth.&amp;quot; (Revelation 11:15-18, ESV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Anointed King that Israel was looking for will reign. He will put all his enemies under his feet. His bride will come to him in splendor, and be radiant and beautiful beyond measure. It is not exactly what the Psalmist had in mind, because it is better. So it often is in our lives, I think. We look for lesser things. We look for only what we can imagine and conceive, and our imaginations and conceptions are extraordinarily small and limited by comparison with the things of God. To be sure, in my own life I have often been limited to a very small view of God’s plans and purposes. More and more I recognize that his wisdom is greater than I can begin to grasp, and from that see the necessity of trusting and worshipping him all the more fully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of that is looking with expectancy to Jesus’ return—recognizing that even the truest and best longings of my heart are but the shallowest hint of what he willbring about when he returns. That the dwelling place of God will be with man, that every evil will be crushed under his justice, and that the garden will have become a glorious city where God will dwell with us and we with him? This is more than I can grasp. But I can hope, and dream, and pray: “Lord come soon.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is no coincidence that the author of Hebrews quotes Psalm 45 at length, explicitly applying vv. 6–7 to Jesus as the one who is above all others.&lt;a href="#fnref1"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Anointed one” is, for example, the term David uses to describe Saul when explaining why he would not kill him. This was the standard term for Israel’s kings. And just like so many other things, the Spirit filled it up with far more meaning when Jesus came as &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; Anointed One.&lt;a href="#fnref2"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

I was deeply moved by the reality that they face every day—persecution, imprisonment, death. There is nothing quite like it in the Western experience of Christianity over the last 1700 years, and little like it elsewhere in the world right now. To be sure, there is persecution that saints around the world face, throughout both the Middle and Far East especially. But North Korea is the harshest and most brutal place in the world —and there are men and women suffering and dying there for the name of Christ. So we prayed for the end of the wicked tyranny of the country’s current leadership, and for the gospel to flourish there, and for those faithful saints to be rewarded and delivered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I read tonight in Revelation 4–7. Two things stood out. The first I have written about before in these devotional reflections: there is a clearly articulated expectation of judgment on the eart. Chapter 6 is a fairly dreadful picture of the wrath of God poured out on a sinful world, and it stands all the more starkly for the reality tha t the majority of the content in these four chapters is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; on judgment, bu ton God and his people. Indeed, these chapters contain some of the most beautiful praises offered to God anywhere in Scripture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worthy are you to take the scroll&lt;br /&gt;
    and to open its seals,&lt;br /&gt;
for you were slain, and by your blood you ransomed people for God,&lt;br /&gt;
    from every tribe and language and people and nation,&lt;br /&gt;
and you have made them a kingdom and priests to our God,&lt;br /&gt;
    and they shall reign on the earth.&lt;br /&gt;
…&lt;br /&gt;
Worthy is the Lamb who was slain,&lt;br /&gt;
    to receive power and wealth and wisdom and might,&lt;br /&gt;
and honor and glory and blesing!&lt;br /&gt;
…&lt;br /&gt;
To him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb&lt;br /&gt;
    be blessing and honor and glory and might forever and ever!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="citation"&gt;
(Revelation 5:9b–10,12b, 13b)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set in the midst of this, and against the backdrop of praise and judgment, is this striking image:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God and for the witness they ahd borne. They cried out with a loud voice, “O Sovereign Lord, holy and true, how long before you will judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?” Then they were each given a white robe and told to rest a little longer, until the number of their fellow servants and their brothers should be complete, who were to be killed as they themselves had been. (Revelation 6:9–11)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The martyrs of God are asked to wait a bit longer, to be yet more patient, before God executes judgment on the earth. And why? Because the number of martyrs is not yet full. This is a shocking, challenging statement. The kingdom of heaven does not come by accident, or by those who are willing to just let it come on its own time. It comes because men and women sacrifice their lives and die for the gospel. It comes because many of our sisters and brothers over the centuries have not counted their lives more precious than Christ, but have counted the souls of the lost more valuable than their own comfort or short-term physical existence. You and I are believers because of such men and women, who have advanced the kingdom of God through the proclamation of the gospel to hard places since the time of the apostles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very least we can do for our brothers and sisters who are helping to fill up that number is pray for them: for their ministry to be effective, for them to be delivered from death, for them to remain faithful in the face of such harsh persecution, and for their governments to cease thte oppression and the gospel to go forth in power. So shall I remembere to do going forward, Lord willing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I saw him, I fell at his feet as though dead. But he laid his right hand on me, saying, “Fear not, I am the first and the last, and the living one. I died, and behold I am alive forevermore, and I have the keys of Death and Hades.” (Revelation 1:17–18)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is the one who was before all, and he is and forever will be. And Jesus is also the one who died. And Jesus is also the firstborn from the dead (Revelation 1:5)—he who died now lives again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Jesus said of another truth of our faith: with man, these things are impossible, but with God, all things are impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Revelation 3:11, Jesus said, “I am coming soon.” Now, some take this to mean that the book is a lie; others take it to mean that Jesus came back in some mystical way and will not return physically to reign on the earth. I take it to mean that “soon” in the eyes of the Almighty who is first and last and reigns forever and ever is not exactly the same as “soon” in the eyes of feeble humans with our limited understanding. The Lord may return any day now—and so it has been these past twenty centuries. We wait expectantly, calling out in our hearts (and sometimes with our lips as well) “Lord, come soon!” And in the interval, this time between the times, we do our best to wait faithfully so that he does not come like a thief and surprise us (Rev. 3:3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psalm 43 serves as another reminder that the Psalms are not some haphazard collection. They were put together in the order they are for a reason. Psalms 42 and 43 are distinct, but they share a refrain and a common line. Whereas 42 functioned as a lament and stated the troubles facing the author, 43 turns and asks justice of God. The contrast is helpful. There is a time simply to let God know our sorrows and our frustrations, and then to instruct our souls to praise him in the midst of those sorrows and frustrations. There is also a time to plead with him to deliver us, and to instruct our souls to praise him as we wait for that deliverance to come. Those may seem like small distinctions, but they matter. We &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; they matter; else the Spirit-inspired editor of the Psalms would not have placed these two here next to each other to contrast with each other in this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading the final chapter of Ecclesiastes and the first chapters of Revelation together is like reading the question and its answer all at once. Ecclesiastes 12 contains some of the most evocative language on the close of life and the vanity of this-worldly existence to be found anywhere in all the literature of all the world. It is a sad passage, meditating on the way all things fade away. Revelation 1, on the other hand, is as clear a declaration that this world is not all there is as anyone could ask. The eternal king of all rulers stands forth to declare that he—he who died and now lives again—is coming soon and will set the world aright, and those who trust in him will receive eternal rewards and even reign alongside him. The world around us is fading, it is true, but there will come a day when it is renewed, when all the things that faded blossom again into gloriously new life. The Preacher could not see that day, but that he longed to could not be clearer from the text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So together with him we say, “Lord, come soon.”&lt;/p&gt;

It is an interesting open to the second of five “books” that make up the Psalms, and the first of the psalms of the sons of Korah. The Psalm includes many of the most evocative images in the whole book, and many of those we quote most often:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psalm 42:1:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a deer pants for flowing streams,&lt;br /&gt;
    so pants my soul fo ryou, O God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psalm 42:5 (also 11, which repeeats it):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why are you cast down, O my soul,&lt;br /&gt;
    and why are you in turmoil within me?&lt;br /&gt;
Hope in God; for I shall again praise him,&lt;br /&gt;
    my salvation and my God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psalm 42:7:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep calls to deep&lt;br /&gt;
    at the roar of your waterfalls;&lt;br /&gt;
all your breakers and your waves&lt;br /&gt;
    have gone over me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Psalm is true to life, evocative, and profoundly moving to me. So often we confront a world in which it seems that all God’s waves have gone over us. Yet the Psalm teaches us both the right response to such circumstances (“Hope in God; for I shall again praise him”) but also about who God is. As I have noted before, the Psalms are not merely our response to God: they are also his inspired revelation of himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is the God upon whom we may call in such times. He is the one who “commands his steadfast love, and at night his song is with [us]” (verse 7). He is the God of our lives (verse 7 again). He is the one who alone can quench the thirst of our souls. It is his presence that will satisfy us, and nothing else. Being removed from him is death to us, though we often forget it in the callousness of life in a dead world (verses 1–2). He is the God who made and owns the waterfalls and the sea and all the lands (verses 6–7). He is the God who calls his people to go with glad shouts and songs of praise, keeping festival (verse 4). He is the God who knows our tears, even when it seems he does not, for he is the God who has &lt;em&gt;shared&lt;/em&gt; our tears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the author(s) of this Psalm, God’s salvation remained far off in many ways. For us, God’s salvation has come, and we participate in him and partake of him. It is not only that God has given us salvation; it is that God &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; our salvation, and for us that salvation has become quite specific. He is Jesus, the Messiah, the anointed king who does justice and righteousness and peace on the earth. When the enemies of God’s people taunt and say, “Where is your God?” (verses 3, 10), and when our lives are filled with tears and mourning (verses 3, 9), we know where our God is. He is enthroned; and seated at the right hand of that throne; and enthroned in our hearts. He is in all and through all and over all. He is near to us, even in the times when he is silent and seems far away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why are you cast down, O my soul,&lt;br /&gt;
    and why are you in turmoil within me?&lt;br /&gt;
Hope in God; for I shall again praise him,&lt;br /&gt;
    my salvation and my God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amen.&lt;/p&gt;

He is holy, and his love and justice run hand in hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our culture has a fixation on the idea that “God is love.” I remember a conversation I had the first weekend I arrived at the University of Oklahoma, most of a decade ago, in which I was discussing with others how God could possibly be a God of love and yet still judge anyone. Likewise, I had another conversation with a friend a few years later in which he argued that this statement in 1 John was the central statement of the character of God. In both cases (as in many others since), it seemed the idea was that this statement was a trump card that overruled anything that contradicted the idea of love held by those pointing to this view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are of course many problems with the idea that “God is love” trumps everything else in the Scriptures. First of all, it is not the only statement of God’s character. Quick to mind for anyone familiar with the scriptures are other statements. Right here in the same book, we have “God is light, and in him there is no darkness at all” (1 John 1:5). And of course we have passages throughout the Bible reminding us emphatically that “Holy, holy, holy is Yahweh Almighty” (see e.g. Isaiah 6:3). So yes, God &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; love… and he &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; light, and he &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; holy, and so on. Indeed, it is his holiness that comes on display throughout the Scriptures most often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there is another problem with the idea that God’s love is somehow in tension with historic Christian ideas about sin and the need of salvation. That problem is the entire rest of the book of 1 John—and for that matter, the rest of &lt;em&gt;this verse&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who does not love does not know God, because God is love. In this the love of God was made manifest among us, that God sent his only Son into the world, so that we might live through him. In this is love, not that we have loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins. (1 John 4:8–10)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God’s love is not a mushy, sappy thing easily turned to overlook sins. It is the kind of love that pursues reconciliation fiercly, and which does not brook rejection lightly. It is the kind of love that dies on behalf of the beloved— but to what end? &lt;em&gt;To make propitiation for sins.&lt;/em&gt; Our sins needed to be propitiated. So yes, God is love—but God is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; corrupted human sentimentality. The same author who wrote that God is love half a chapter later says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoever does not believe God has made him a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony that God has borne concerning his Son. And this is the testimony, that God gave us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life. (1 John 5:10b–12)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not the sort of thing that fits nicely in a hyper-“tolerant” view of the world, in which no offense may be condemned (save perhaps condemnation). It is, however, a beautiful and magnificent picture of a God who loves so fiercely he would die to deal with his beloved’s offense, though that offense be against him. It is a picture of a God whose love does not conflict with his justice but runs hand in hand with it. It is a picture of a Savior who laid down his life for his sheep &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; who will not lightly see that salvation scorned. It is a picture of a real God who really is reigning over all in wisdom and goodness— goodness that is not mere fondness or tolerance, but which passionately seeks the good of the whole universe, including every man and woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hallelujah. We have a great God.&lt;/p&gt;

On the one hand, we affirm that he was fully human, and this affirmation binds us to affirm that he could indeed sin: all humans are capable of sinning, and apart from Jesus, all humans &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; sinned. The author of Hebrews reminds us forcefully that Jesus was made like his brothers—which is to say, &lt;em&gt;us&lt;/em&gt;—in every respect, being tempted like them, yet without sin. On the other hand, we recognize that the Godhead is sinless and that, as James reminds us, he neither tempts nor can be tempted with evil. As with many issues relating to the Incarnation, we face the challenge of holding together both Jesus’ full deity and his full humanity. When either is lost (or even simply diminished) in order to emphasize or preserve the other, important aspects of our faith break in serious ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Difficult (mysterious even) the question may be, but the author of Hebrews leaves little doubt. Jesus was tempted like us in &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; way—not only in some ways, but in every way. This is an essential affirmation for the Christian faith. If Jesus could not sin, then he was not fully human, and his perfect life is unsurprising and not particularly meaningful. If he &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; sin, then his perfect life is extraordinary and especially meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, we must integrate the things that Hebrews and James (and the rest of the Scriptures) teach us. If the Godhead cannot be tempted by sin and Jesus &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; tempted by sin, does this make Jesus somehow &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; God? No, for this misses the rest of the witness of the New Testament, including those selfsame books. James himself calls Jesus Lord in terms that, set against a Jewish background, can only be understood to refer to God himself (see especially James 5:11, perhaps the most direct quote of Exodus 34:6 in the whole New Testament and an unmistakable reference to Yahweh God). Neither can we admit the notion that James and Hebrews disagree with each other—at least, not and maintain our affirmation of the unity of Scripture, which is a non-negotiable from where I stand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with many things in the Trinity and the Incarnation, then, we are left making a dual (and apparently conflicting affirmation). Jesus’ humanity was perfectly capable of sinning, and his divinity was incapable of sinning. The Incarnation holds the two together in a single person, and so we affirm that Jesus could have sinned, but did not. We note, too, that he did not precisely because he did as all humans are called to do (and what glorified humans &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; do) and perfectly trusted the Father by obeying the Holy Spirit. Jesus’ perfect life was not the domination of his humanity by his divinity, but the submission of his humanity to the divinity of the Trinity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus we affirm that Jesus’ not sinning on our behalf was a real moral victory, not a hollow thing we can only look at bemusedly from afar. He lived as a real second Adam, doing what the first Adam failed to do while beset by many more and far greater temptations than the first Adam. He really did overcome the world— not only its powers, but its temptations. He really did demonstrate true and perfect holiness that we might follow his example. He really did triumph over every power of sin, that we might be transformed into his likeness. Though the triune God is never tempted to sin, the triune God mysteriously partook of everything it is to be human in the Incarnation, and that humanity &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be tempted—and he overcame.&lt;/p&gt;

Div.</category><category>SEBTS</category></item><item><title>Joy Comes… After Pleading</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/joy-comes-after-pleading.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;In addition to the devotional reading I have been recording here, I have been working through large stretches of the Old Testament in my second Old Testament survey class, which covers everything after Job in your English Bible—the Psalms, the Wisdom literature, and all the Prophets. To cover all that ground in a single semester requires moving quickly—so quickly that I both skip over details I might otherwise be attentive to, and pick up on overarching themes I might otherwise miss. This is particularly evident in the Psalms, and having just gone through them at a high pace makes the flow and the context of each individual Psalm more apparent as I come to them for the details again in my ordinary devotional reading. Reading large chunks and then coming back through the same section more slowly is such a helpful practice that I expect I shall try to keep it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming to Psalm 40, I am right in the middle of the Psalms of David—a whole stretch focusing on&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; David’s life and circumstances. Reading this particular Psalm on its own is illuminating in its own ways, of course. It is easy to come away with a sense of the joy of salvation from the exultant verses here. The poem leaps from one triumphant note to another, rejoicing in how Yahweh delivers his people and his anointed one. Hallelujah to that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Psalm’s meaning is much, much richer when situated in the broader context of the book, though. When we turn back a single song and look at Psalm 39, we see that not every moment is so rosy and joyful. As I noted in my &lt;a href="/2014%20/with-confidence/"&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt;, the prayer in Psalm 39 is bold and leans hard on God— because David &lt;em&gt;needed&lt;/em&gt; God profoundly. He needed salvation from his sins; he recognized the brevity of his own life and especially its fragility before the almighty maker of heaven and earth;&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; he knew that only Yahweh could accomplish what he needed. The (Spirit-inspired!) editor of the Psalms took these two poems on David’s life and set them next to each other to teach us something about the contours of a life devoted to Yahweh. Not every moment is either sorrowful &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; rejoicing. More often, each one leads into the other as the seasons of our life ebb and flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This ebb and flow is &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;. We see the beauty of our salvation the more clearly because it is set against the backdrop of our great need for salvation. All too often, we recognize that need only because we have been forced to by our circumstances—by the travails of human life that range from parenting a teething toddler to staring death full in its cancerous face (and we ought not make little or too much of either, different scales though they be). We sometimes find the joy of our salvation sweeter and more savory when we have wrestled through the pain of loss and the wrestling with God that ensues. We sometimes treasure God’s answer more when has required us to wait for it—to wait for &lt;em&gt;him&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that every trial is aimed at this end. It is to say that the contrast between Psalms 39 and 40 helps us see that &lt;em&gt;sometimes&lt;/em&gt; our trials work out to deepen our joy in salvation. That in turn helps us hold on to God all the more in the face of those trials, because it stands as one more picture of his goodness and wisdom, and thus of his trustworthiness.&lt;/p&gt;

They show us how we ought to approach God, and teach us who God is. Psalm 39 is no exception: it does both, through and through. David opens the Psalm by expressing a sentiment we have all shared at some time or another: holding our tongue around those who are actively causing us grief or harm, lest we sin, and finally coming to a point when we can hold back our frustration no longer. Unlike my typical response, though, David did not lash out at those who frustrated him. As is typical of the response the Psalms record, David turned instead to God. It is a striking turn:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mused, the fire burned&lt;br /&gt;
    then I spoke with my tongue:&lt;br /&gt;
O Yahweh…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the Psalm is addressed not to David’s enemies (mentioned in verse 1) as a rebuke, but to the one who can deliver him from those enemies and from his own sin. It is not a quiet, passive Psalm, but a loud and forceful request (though not, notably, a demand) that Yahweh be gracious and deliver David from his own transgressions. There is acknowledgement, to be sure, of fault, but also bold importuning of the sovereign God of the universe to act in a certain way in David’s life &lt;em&gt;when David had sinned&lt;/em&gt;. Even to those of us who stand on this side of the cross—we who are enjoined to come confidently before the throne of grace (Hebrews 4:16)—this kind of boldness is a bit shocking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Psalms are full of this kind of thing—and frankly, it tends to make most of us uncomfortable. The idea that we could thus address God seems out of line or inappropriate. It seems remarkably bold to say to God, “Hear my prayer, O &lt;span class="smcp"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, / and give ear to my cry; / hold not your peace at my tears!” More: it seems on the verge of untrusting, not to recognize that God always has his right and wise reasons for acting as he does and allowing (even ordaining) the things we experience. David has no qualms about this, though; in fact, it typifies the way he and the other Psalmists address God in the midst of trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder if perhaps we struggle with these kinds of prayers precisely because &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; do not know or trust God as we ought. (And that we? It points mostly at me here.) David could come beseech God to be merciful and kind to him by delivering him from his own sin because he knew God to be merciful and gracious. He could plead boldly with God because he knew that God is both all-good and all-wise, and that God’s answer would be &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt;. In short, he could come boldly before the throne of Yahweh Almighty because he &lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt; Yahweh Almighty. How much more can we who have seen Yahweh’s mercy writ large in the grotesque humiliations of the incarnation, death, and resurrection of Jesus be confident in his goodness and wisdom and mercy toward us? When we see our own sin, and when we taste discipline for that sin, are we able to go to our Father in heaven and plead for deliverance from our own folly with this kind of confidence?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If not, it is only because we do not know him or trust him as we ought.&lt;/p&gt;

This is not a hard rule with him. He has letters like 1 and 2 Corinthians in which the content moves back and forth more freely between the two kinds of material, and he also mixes imperatives in with indicatives and vice versa in all his letters. On the whole, though Colossians follows this pattern fairly closely: chapter 1 and the first part of chapter 2 are statements of theological truth (and among the highest and weightiest such in Scripture), and the rest of the book moves into the Christian response to these truths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a mere 44 verses (fewer if one leaves out the introduction), Paul traverses enormous depths of theology. Christ is the author of Creation, the one in whom all things hold together. He is before all things. He is the head of the church. He is the image of the invisible God. He is the heir (“firstborn”) of creation; it belongs to him in its entirety. He is the firstborn (and heir) of the resurrection from the dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is no surprise, then, that the consequences range over all aspects of human life. There is nothing that goes untouched: not our family life, nor our economic behavior, nor our religious activity, nor our thoughts or actions in any area. Paul enjoined the Colossians to set aside all “sexual immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry…. anger, wrath, malice, slander, and obscene talk from your mouth” (Colossians 3:5,8). As Abraham Kuyper put it of culture, there is no part of life over which Christ does not shout, “Mine!” So it is in our lives as well: we are his wholly and utterly, fight it though we often do at times. We may foolishly cling to our sins, or we may seek to be sanctified in every area of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note well the constant return to the foundational truths on which that call to holiness is built. Paul not only lays out these exhortations as following the indication of all Christ has already done, but points again and again to the reality that sanctifiaction can happen only as we are joined with Christ. We died with Christ (2:20) and have been raised with Christ (3:1). He is our life (3:4) and our life is hidden with God in Christ (3:3). Christ is all, and in all (3:11). His peace rules in our hearts (3:15); his word dwells in us richly in the context of song and psalm (3:16).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are not small things, or light matters. These are magnificent and holy, and they call us to be holy likewise. God is very great—very far beyond us— but he draws us near in his loving kindness and calls us out of our selfishness and sin and into his holy ways. Hallelujah.&lt;/p&gt;

I might get called names or insulted occasionally (though only occasionally), but I have never been at risk of loss of property, much less of health or life, because I follow Christ. Believers in other places and other times are not so at ease among those who do not follow God. For those who are not so at ease, the prosperity and success of those who oppress them are much larger concerns—much nearer to home, and much more urgently in need of justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, in both of Paul’s letters to the Thessalonians, he encourages them to remain steadfast in part by pointing to God’s future judgment on the enemies of Christ. He points them to the future return of Jesus not to remove the believers from this world, but to judge those who reject God and to rule in righteousness over the world. That is a cause for rejoicing for believers: all of us want to see the world put right, with an end to poverty and war, cancer and rape, tornadoes and abortion, Alzheimers and murder, oppression and death. Nearly &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; wants this kind of world, in theory. But in practice, we are either children of God or people who “refused to love the truth and so be saved” (2 Thessalonians 2:10). And those who refuse to love the truth and be saved oppress and murder the people of God (and everyone else, but &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; the people of God).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our fellow believers in Saudi Arabia and Iran and North Korea are not reading these passages of judgment and wondering how God could judge so harshly. They are reading them and holding fast to the hope that this day will come &lt;em&gt;soon&lt;/em&gt;, when those who grind underfoot the poor, the widow, and the orphan, who throw Jesus’ followers in jail and execute their pastors, will get justice at the hands of God. Many of our fellow believers look forward to the day when &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; will get justice from God, because in this present life injustice has often been their lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In just a little while, the wicked will be no more;&lt;br /&gt;
    though you look carefully at his place, he will not be there.&lt;br /&gt;
But the meek shall inherit the land&lt;br /&gt;
    and delight themselves in abundant peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This points me forward in several ways. First, it reminds me that this is an area in which I need to be sanctified. Contrary to everything the surrounding world says, a lack of judgment on the part of God would be grotesquely unrighteous. We can see this clearly in the most egregious cases: none of us think it would be right for Charles Manson or Stalin to get off without punishment. But God’s justice is deeper than ours, and truer, and that is &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;. Lord willing, I will come to understand more and more the goodness of his doing justice and righteousness on the earth, not least as I understand that his &lt;em&gt;shalom&lt;/em&gt; will not come—could not come—apart from his doing justice. And his doing justice means crushing evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, it reminds me (again) that we Westerners, much though we have to offer to our brothers and sisters around the world, also have much to learn from them. The persecuted church is not so easily led astray in this area as we in our comfort are. Likewise, we have much to learn from those who have gone before us. Whatever their faults, many of our forebears in the faith got &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; right where we get it wrong. We would do well to listen more humbly to our fellow saints of every age and every tribe—and not to arrogate to ourselves the right to judge God’s justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, it reminds me to pray for God to work his justice in the world: to deliver suffering saints in lands hostile to the gospel, and to end the oppression of the wicked either by saving them from their sins or by ruining them. This is not a comfortable prayer, but it is a good and right prayer. It reminds me, too, to pray all the more fervently: “Lord, come soon!”&lt;/p&gt;

Like the rest of the Scriptures, though, it does yield its treasures as we seek the face of God there. Remembering that Scripture is the self-revelation of one who wants to be known helps us situate the hard passages and find their meaning. We are not left wandering in the dark; we can see God here. This is no less true of the pages of Zechariah than of the letters of Paul. The latter, it is true, may be more direct and explicit—but the fact that Ecclesiastes gets at the character of God sideways, as it were, tells us something about God. It tells us that not everything about him can be learned from looking straight on, from direct propositions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it is only in travail, in the “dark night of the soul” that we learn who our Maker really is. Sometimes it is only in poetry. Sometimes it is when the pursuit of wisdom turns to folly that we learn that wisdom is not some reified artifact to be apprehended, but a living person who is always Other and Above—Holy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solomon went running after every kind of good in this world and for answers to all his questions. The more he searched, the more he gained, the more lost he was and the more he lost. The problem was not seeking the goods of this world, nor in seeking answers to questions. It was partly in seeking them where they could never be found, and partly in failing to be silent before the face of God who has not chosen to answer every question, and partly in succumbing to the notion that the depths of reality can be plumbed. Some things are forever out of our grasp; some knowledge is always too high for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That does not mean we ought not seek after wisdom. It means we ought to seek Wisdom himself, to go after the one who has become to us wisdom from God along with righteousness and peace. It means we ought to revel in what can be known, and revel too where God says, “This is mystery. Trust me.” The world is big enough for mystery. Humans, too, are big enough for mystery. Too often we shrink ourselves down, shrink down the world around us, shrink down God himself, so that we may all fit in conveniently sized packages with regular shapes. But God is always bursting out of our bounds, surprising us with his fierce love and his sharply tender grace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solomon’s conclusion in chapter 5—like the conclusion to which he eventually comes in the end of the book—is simpler than we might expect, given the travails of his heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behold, what I have seen to be good and fitting is to eat and drink and find enjoyment in all the toil with which one toils under the sun the few days of his life that God has given him, for this is his lot. Everyone also to whom God has given wealth and possessions and power to enjoy them, and to accept his lot and rejoice in his toil—this is the gift of God. For he will not much remember the days of his life because God keeps him occupied with joy in his heart. (Ecclesiastes 5:18–20)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small things, these: to eat and drink and find enjoyment in all our toil. Or perhaps not so small, when we look at them again. For Solomon has already told us that these are vanity when not given and received as gifts from God. They will not satisfy. They are just wind and emptiness. But then God fills them up, and they are suddenly good. God brings joy in these simple things. Is this not what all of us desire? Is it not what Solomon chased and failed to find (the confession of the preceding and following chapters of the book)? Is it not the original promise of the world: to work it and enjoy the fruit of one’s labor as a gift from God’s hand? No, these are not small things. They are very great. And they come from God, with joy. Hallelujah.&lt;/p&gt;

The historic, orthodox answer is a resounding “yes”—though a clearly qualified and well articulated “yes.” This is not just the historic, orthodox position; it is the &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; position. Mary was indeed the “mother of God”. She was the mother of Jesus. Jesus was (and is) fully God &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; fully man, completely and truly, both at once without loss of the full measure of either. He did not cease being totally divine upon his incarnation, but he did assume full humanity. The argument is as simple as it first seems: Mary is the mother of Jesus, and Jesus is God, therefore Mary is the mother of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evangelicals tend to shy away from following the broader tradition and affirming that Mary is the mother of God. There are many reasons for this, not least our general discomfort with things having to do with Mary born of the over- referencing of Mary in the Catholic tradition and the actual Mariolatry that is too often evinced in Catholic lay practice throughout the world. However, our response ought not be to reject this view, but to speak carefully and clearly and reject what is mistaken while keeping what is true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is true that we must be nuanced in our handling of this issue. The word “mother” brings with it implications that we must avoid, and we must remember Jesus’ statements on what it meant to be his mother and brothers and sisters in the gospels (i.e. that those who followed him were those really deserving of the titles). However, simply to set aside the title is to lose important aspects of the reality of the incarnation. If we say that Mary was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the mother of God, we are really saying either that she was not truly the mother of Jesus, or that Jesus was not fully God. Neither of these is a tolerable option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, to those qualifications. When we say that Mary is the mother of God, we are not saying that God in any sense has his source in her. All of the humanity of Jesus finds its source equally in Mary and in the Spirit’s divine intervention —but Mary was created by the Son, rather than the Son originating in her. Mary is the mother of God in Christ, but she is not to the Son exactly as ordinary mothers are to ordinary sons, for Jesus was not an ordinary son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nor do we mean that Mary has special prerogatives because of her relationship to Jesus. As noted above, Jesus made clear that he was concerned above all with obedience to the will of God (see e.g. Matthew 12:46–50). Thus, the devotions offered to Mary by our Catholic and Eastern Orthodox brothers and sisters is misplaced, as is the notion that her prayers are somehow more effective in touching Jesus’ heart than are those of the ordinary saint who is seeking to honor God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These qualifications notwithstanding, we must still be willing and ready to affirm that Mary was in fact the Mother of God. To do otherwise is to reduce in one way or another the mystery of the incarnation. It is not so much that &lt;em&gt;Mary&lt;/em&gt; is important here as that affirming her motherhood of God helps us affirm the important points to which we must hold fast in terms the full deity and full humanity of &lt;em&gt;Christ&lt;/em&gt;. Mary is important because Jesus humanity came by means of Mary’s body. Everything that it is to be man, Jesus always was from conception, and everything that it is to be God, Jesus always was from the moment of his conception.&lt;/p&gt;

Div.</category><category>SEBTS</category></item><item><title>Resolved to Pray</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/resolved-to-pray.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Paul’s letters all open with a common pattern: he gives the typical introduction of his era with his own name and those of his co-authors, and then proceeds to explain how he prays for the people to whom he is writing. I read once of someone who went through and looked at all the things Paul prays for people in his epistles and used those as a basis for his own prayers for others. That seems a remarkably good idea to me. Paul’s heart for each and every church to which he ministered is readily apparent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope and pray that as I step more and more into ministry, my own heart would be so dedicated to the good of those whom I serve, and that I would be so faithful as Paul was to pray regularly for them. I have a long way to go in this; I do not pray as much even for my own family and friends as I would like. Jaimie and I have made prayer a regular part of our lives by sitting down as a family together to pray every night before we put Elayne to bed, and I pray at times throughout the day. These are good things. I am glad we have taken these steps to make prayer a regular part of our lives. Even so, I am much less dedicated and disciplined in prayer than many I know and especially than the many heroes of the faith who distinguished themselves in large part through the faithfulness of their prayers and their trust that God would answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The content of Paul’s prayers is just as important as their frequency, though. Reading 1 Thessalonians 1 reminded me of the &lt;em&gt;kinds&lt;/em&gt; of things I ought to be praying, as well as &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; I ought to be praying. In this particular introduction, Paul is above all grateful to God for the Thessalonians’ “work of faith and labor of love and steadfastness of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ.” This faithfulness before God resounded throughout the early church; these believers had a reputation for their perseverance in the face of persecution and their love of God. What a thing to start praying for the believers I know, and especially for my church and the missionaries we have sent out: that we would be known for our faith, love, and steadfast hope in Jesus Christ; that we would persevere in the face of challenges to our faith and even outright persecution; that the testimony of our deeds would go forth and be an encouragement to the rest of the Church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resolved, then: to pray more faithfully for my fellow saints, first of all at First Baptist Church of Durham and then in the other churches I know and love and then throughout the world as I hear of them; and to pray more thoughtfully and wisely for God to make of us all the kinds of people over whom Paul was rejoicing in these early verses of this letter. Amen.&lt;/p&gt;

It is such a simple passage, but the human wickedness on display is profound. The scene is this: Jesus has already been condemned by the Jews. Judas—expecting &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; other outcome than Jesus’ death, or simply turned back from the plan to which he had previously agreed—comes, seeking to make right what he had done wrong. The priests respond by rejecting him, and he throws the money down on the floor before he goes and hangs himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The priests then note that it would be &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt; to put the money in the temple treasury, since it was after all blood money. Here these men were, having just plotted the death of a man they knew to be innocent, a man they could condemn only on trumped up charges after a farce of a trail, worried about whether they should put a few pieces of silver in the treasury or not. Their conclusion, that the money could not be used for the temple because it was “blood money”, still did not make them realize the horror of their sin—that they had bought a man’s life! That they should do this with &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; man is a horror; that they would do it with their long-awaited Messiah, the incarnate Son of God, is a horror beyond words. That they could not see the disjunction between their scruples about where the money was used and the very reason they had the money should put the fear of sin in us all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is human depravity. We can look our sin square in the face and not see it for what it is sometimes. We become inured to its power and its hold on us. We think we can just deal with it in some way or another—and we are profoundly wrong. We cannot deal with our sin apart from the saving work of Chris ton our behalf. We cannot even see it clearly without the illuminating power of the Holy Spirit. No divine intervention means no holiness on our part; without the work of God we would remain forever trapped in the darkness that shrouds our eyes from seeing our sin aright and from seeing our great and awesome God as he is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet this is also the hand of God at work. So often God takes what men meant for evil and works it for good. Often we cannot see his means &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; his ends, but we know from the gospels that the greatest evil ever perpetrated by men—the only innocent man dead at the hands of hardenered human hearts—was used of God to accomplish the greatest good ever provided to men. This lets us trust that God is likewise at work in our own lives. We know that he is all-wise and all-good. We do not know what he aims to accomplish with every act (nor indeed with many of his acts), but we know that those aims will be for the good of all those who love him and (most importantly) are loved by him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hallelujah.&lt;/p&gt;

Vanity!</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/vanity-vanity.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Ecclesiastes is one of the most interpretively challenging books in the whole Bible. &lt;a href="/2014/ordinary-means-the-silence-of-god/"&gt;Like Esther&lt;/a&gt;, its inclusion in the canon was much debated. Unlike Esther, the book mentions God plenty—but its approach to theology is challenging, to say the least. The author, generally understood to be Solomon, is not exactly a cheerful fellow and is his approach to life can be summed up in the single word that is the refrain of the whole book: “Vanity!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chapter 2 gives us this bleak outlook applied to pleasure and possessions on the one hand and vocation on the other. In both cases, the Preacher (Heb. &lt;em&gt;qoheleth&lt;/em&gt;) comes to the same conclusion: “Then I considered all tha tmy hands had done and the toil I had expended in doing it, and behold, all was vanity and a striving after wind, and there was nothing to be gained under the sun” (Ecclesiastes 2:11). This is so bleak as to border on despair, and therefore no few Christians of my acquaintance find the book difficult to integrate with their theology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem, as near as I can tell, is one of genre.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Ecclesiastes is wisdom literature, and it serves as an extended meditation on the world that Solomon found around him. And taken without the context of redemptive history, Solomon’s proclamation that everything is vanity is perfectly accurate. Life is a grind. We cannot keep the things we earn or buy, no matter how magnificent. If we are perfectly wise in our dealings, we will nonetheless die and leave everything we have to others, and who knows whether they will be geniuses, mediocrities, or idiots? We can have a thousand pleasures at our command, and we will find them all unsatisfactory in the end. We can work hard, and have nothing to show for it when we return to dust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But all these things are observations of the world as it is—not statements on what it ought to be. It is easy to mistake description for prescription. The Preacher never suggests that life in this world &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be mere vanity. To the contrary: the very fact that he was asking the questions he asked is indicative of the real shape of reality. We all ask the same questions with him at some point or another: Does my work matter? Would I be satisfied if I had every material thing I could desire? Would having (functionally) infinite sexual choice&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; bring me contentment? Solomon discovered the answer: no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there we leave it, for chapter 2. But my other reading tonight was in Matthew and in Psalms, and they do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; leave it there. Psalm 33 points us to the ways that Yahweh works justice in the world and calls us to rejoice in him, not in the things of this age. Matthew 22–25 reminds us that the kingdom of heaven is &lt;em&gt;coming&lt;/em&gt;; it is not here yet. The age to come will be so &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; much better than this one. No more will our existence be nothing but vanity. Hallelujah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am looking forward to seeing this covered in my Old Testament II class this semester, as I suspect that the coverage there will prove illuminating.

&lt;li id="fn2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think about the fact that Solomon is reported to have had some 1,000 wives and concubines (see 1 Kings 11:3). This may not be infinite in the strictest sense of the word… but it is close enough.&lt;a href="#fnref2"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

In my view, however, the question is impossible to answer. I do not think Scripture speaks with sufficient clarity on the matter. We know on the one hand that all are “by nature children of wrath” (Ephesians 2:3), and that “all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God” (Romans 3:23). What neither of these texts tell us, though, and what indeed &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; text tells us, is whether people are guilty at birth or whether they are simply sinful and become guilty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could reason to a conclusion that accords with our other theological commitments with little difficulty. We know that God is just, and punishes for the wrongs we commit, but we have no evidence that he punishes wrongs we &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; commit, and therefore we might conclude that he would therefore not find guilty any newly conceived or newly born person. On the other hand, we also must reckon with the reality that the Scriptures treat questions of progeny far differently than do individually-minded modern Westerners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scripture points us to the God who “will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children and the children’s children, to the third and the fourth generation” (Exodus 34:7) as well as the God who proclaims that “The soul who sins shall die. The son shall not suffer for the iniquity of the father, nor the father suffer for the iniquity of the son” (Ezekiel 18:20). Paul did write that “one trespass led to condemnation for all men,” but he immediately follows up this provocative statement by arguing that “one act of righteousness leads to justification and life for all men” (Romans 5:18)—yet we know that Paul does not (and cannot) here mean that all men are saved, for we know that he believes that those who do not repent and believe the gospel perish in their sins under the expectation of judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We cannot from the evidence that God has given us decide this question. We are left without an answer. If we grant the sufficiency of Scripture, then we must recognize that if there are questions God has in his wisdom opted not to answer, it is for a reason, and we should cease with our speculations and be silent. We may not know whether infants are &lt;em&gt;guilty&lt;/em&gt;, but we do know two other things that are far more important than that: First, God is merciful and gracious and just. We will not in the final reckoning find his justice lacking or his treatment of (for example) those who died in infancy to be lacking. Second, all are born under the dual curse of sin’s hold and death’s certainty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These truths give us clear and straightforward points of application. First, we must preach the gospel clearly to people of every age and intellectual ability, for even little children sin and death is awaiting us all. Whether or not we are born guilty, we &lt;em&gt;become&lt;/em&gt; guilty very quickly. Second, much of the speculation on this question—and many churches practices such as infant baptism—seems to be rooted in worry about the fate of those who die young, without having made a credible profession of faith. Yet even if we &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; know the answer to the question of their guilt, we still might not know God’s response. Even did we know the answer, still we would need learn to trust in the goodness and wisdom of God in this matter.&lt;/p&gt;

Div.</category><category>SEBTS</category></item><item><title>Not Simple</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/not-simple.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, I hate the heading markers in my Bible. While they can be helpful for some people at some times, I find more and more that they simply distract. They make it difficult to see—or to remember—that the books are &lt;em&gt;books&lt;/em&gt;. Nowhere is this more distracting than in the gospels. The gospels are coherent books. They are not mere collections of stories, arranged haphazardly or tossed together willy-nilly; the authors had a point and purpose in what they were doing, and that point and purpose is hard to see for the constant interruptions in the text. These interruptions, not present in the original, mask the way the pieces fit together—and they mask the surprising ways they do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; obviously fit together, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because these are the kinds of questions we should be asking as we read through the book: Why does Matthew transition from Jesus’ rather shocking encounter with his family—the one where he proclaims that his disciples are his family in a way that his biological family is not—to the death of John the Baptist? And why from there to the feeding of the five thousand? And why thence to interactions with the scribes and Pharisees? He is going somewhere with this narrative; where? What does he want us to see?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In John 14, Jesus leaves the crowds behinds to seek respite on hearing of the death of his cousin and fellow servant of Yahweh, John the Baptizer. But then a crowd finds him, and he has compassion on them; he goes out of his way to care for them. Then, a few hundred words later, he compares a Canaanite woman to a dog, using the racially charged language of the Jews. (This should shock the reader, given how Matthew has already had Jesus praise outsiders and proclaim that the kingdom will be composed of those who were far off as well as of those who were near.) But then he blesses her for her faith. Then Matthew follows this story with another case of his feeding a multitude because of his compassion for them. Scattered through all these narratives are his interactions with the Pharisees, whom he repeatedly criticizes in the harshest terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why these particular stories? Why these particular contrasts?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it is because Matthew aims to confound his readers in precisely the ways the disciples (Matthew himself included) were confounded. We see that they were often confused. We see that they failed to understand who he was, and then even as they began to grasp that he was the Messiah (14:32, 16:16), they continued to misunderstand what he was about. His teachings confused them, and they had to learn over and over again the same lessons. Matthew has structured his narrative so that the reader is faced with the same kinds of confounding contrasts that the disciples faced. We, too, must wrestle with this Son of Man who both overflows with compassion on the crowds and repeatedly evinces his frustration with the faithlessness of the people. We, too, must come to terms with a king who planned from the first to die rather than than to conquer. We, too, must read the riddles rightly—and marvel though we do at the disciples who did not understand his parables, if we are honest we must admit how we struggle to interpret them ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is not simple. He never was. We too often try to fit him into a neat box: the social revolutionary, or the the compsassionate healer, or the righteous firebrand, or the gentle savior. Take your pick, according to your social and political preferences. But he will not be so boxed in. He is all of these and more, and he is none of these insofar as none of them circumscribe him. He is righteousness and justice and peace&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—which means that he thunders forth judgment, and he tenderly comforts those in need. It means that he offers sharp edges and delighted praise to the same people. It means that he marveled at the faith and the faithlessness of people whose hearts he knew before they spoke. It means that he is a mystery even as he reveals himself plainly. It means that he cannot be comprehended, but invites us to know him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A trio I borrowed from J. Clinton McCann Jr.’s description of Yahweh’s “anointed one” (that is, “messiah”) in the Psalms. See Chapter 12: Hearing the Psalter in &lt;cite&gt;Hearing the Old Testament&lt;/cite&gt;, eds. Craig G. Bartholomew &amp;amp; David J. H. Beldman.&lt;a href="#fnref1"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

It is a splendid poetic demonstration of an arc we have all traced out. David opens the Psalm by telling us where he is going. The first two stanzas declare that Yahweh saves and enjoins his saints to praise him, “For his anger is but for a moemnt, / and his favor is for a lifetime. / Weeping may tarry for the night, / but joy comes with the morning” (Psalm 30:5).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then David tells us how he got there. I cannot do better in summing up the third stanza than simply quoting it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for me, I said in my prosperity,&lt;br /&gt;
    “I shall never be moved.”&lt;br /&gt;
By your favor, O &lt;span class="smcp"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;br /&gt;
    you made my mountain stand strong;&lt;br /&gt;
you hid your face;&lt;br /&gt;
    I was dismayed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of the most basic human follies. As God cares for us and provides for us, we take credit for it ourselves. But it was &lt;em&gt;Yahweh&lt;/em&gt; who made David’s “mountain stand strong”—not David. The moment Yahweh took away his presence, David was in ruin. How often do we all fall prey to exactly this sort of nonsense? How often do I trust in my own capabilities or my own wisdom, and credit my own hard work and talents for where I stand in life? Certainly, I am too clever to do so openly, even to myself: I know that I should not be resting on my own merits. But deep down, we all make that dreadful move sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other significant point of interest in this third stanza is what it was that dismayed David. He does not emphasize here whatever external consequences he may have experienced in his pride (though the next stanza suggests that there were some). Rather, he points to the Yahweh’s withdrawal of his presence: “you hid your face” (Psalm 30:7b) as the basis for his dismay. Would that I were so sensitive to God that I recognized his presence as far more important than any other situational reality. We are offered the privilege of fellowship with the divine, and so often we—so often &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;—turn away from it for other, lesser things. So often, we are more frustrated by the difficulties of our trials than we are by a lack of relationship with our heavenly Father. David has the right of it, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is much that could be said of the fourth stanza on questions of theological development, Old Testament understandings of death, and so on. More interesting to me—in a devotional context, at least!—is the point of the stanza: a simple plea for help from Yahweh. Again, David’s response is a model for us. When faced with the removal of God’s presence and the looming consequences, he prayed for salvation. The result, coming in the fifth and final stanza, is the restoration of David’s state. Yahweh moved him from the ritual death of lament (“mourning” and “sackloth”) to ritual life (“dancing” and “gladness”).&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Importantly, David does not make again the mistake that took him down this road in the first place. He recognizes that Yahweh had restored him for a reason:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that my glory may sing your praise and be not silent,&lt;br /&gt;
    O &lt;span class="smcp"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; my God, I will give thanks to you forever!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His “glory”—his mountain standing strong—was not for his own pleasure, but for the honor of the one who made him stand strong.&lt;/p&gt;

This is a tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I was reading through Matthew 5–9 this morning, I was struck again by the force of Jesus’ moral teaching here. He takes major categories of sin and intensifies the Old Testament’s teaching on it: murder, adultery, penury, and self-righteousness all come in for his condemnation here. Now, it is true that the standard he sets is perfection: “You therefore must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect,” he says (Matthew 5:48, ESV). To be sure, none of us can measure up to this standard. In one sense, then, those who point out that this teaching shows us our need for Christ’s salvation are absolutely right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there is more going on here than merely highlighting our need for Christ. There is a picture of kingdom ethics that we are too quick to step over. “Ah,” we say, “I can never be perfect, but thank God for covering my imperfections!” and we move along through our lives. This is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; what the text requires of us; it is not what God requires of us. The resurrection of Christ was like the first crack in a piece of glass, and our participation in his resurrection is like the spidering of that crack out until the whole glass is shattered completely. The old world has not yet passed away, but the new one is pushing its way through the cracks, visible more and more in our lives as we pursue holy Christlikeness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least, that is how it ought to be. But this in-breaking of the new age is hard work, and it is far easier to empty the Sermon on the Mount of its binding force on our lives. It is easier to look at the moral instruction of Scripture and see only one use of the Law: condemning sinners where they stand so they will look to Christ. Yet the Law does more than this. It also teaches us what God is like, and what his people ought to be like. So when Jesus says to us that we must put aside our anger at our brothers and sisters, that we must do whatever it takes to deal with lust, that we must not retaliate but instead go above and beyond in serving those who do us harm, we must &lt;em&gt;obey&lt;/em&gt;. When he tells us how to pray, how to fast, how to give to the needy (and, for that matter, that we &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; to give generously to the needy), we must &lt;em&gt;obey&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said both:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.” (Matthew 5:20)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.” (Matthew 7:21)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sermon on the Mount both tells us of our need for Christ because we cannot be perfect, and requires us to genuinely pursue perfection to honor our Savior.&lt;/p&gt;

Just as the Old Testament carefully preserved the lineages of the people—most notably in Numbers and Chronicles— so Matthew carefully laid out the descent of Christ, showing that his (adoptive) father’s line ran true back through David.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; If, as some scholars of the canon have speculated, Matthew’s Old Testament canon concluded with Chronicles,&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; this beginning seems especially fitting, but in any case Matthew was clearly interested in establishing continuity between his work and the Hebrew Bible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pick up this same thread in his constant use of the word “fulfill.” The way Matthew uses the word has been much discussed among scholars, since many of the passages he quotes are clearly &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; talking about the Messiah in particular. While some see this as evidence of either Matthew’s exegetical failure or the validity of purely allegorical readings, I think&lt;a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the solution is simpler. Matthew is using the word in a &lt;em&gt;simpler&lt;/em&gt; fashion. He means not “fulfill” in the sense in which we use the word of formal prophecies, but “fill up”. The Greek word &lt;em&gt;pleróō&lt;/em&gt; (πληρόω) covers both.&lt;a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; When Matthew says that some event “fulfills” something from the Old Testament, he is not arguing that the Old Testament bit he references was originally written about Jesus, but rather that Jesus takes that original thing and fills it up with &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; meaning than it originally had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combination of these two things, in any case, is to point us to the Jewishness and the Old Testament background against which Jesus did his entire ministry, and in which the church was born. Last semester and this semester, I have been taking survey classes of the Old Testament, and I find them extremely valuable. The Old Testament is underpreached in most churches, because (I think) it is undervalued in most churches. Whether because of a simplistic and misguided notion that the Old Testament has only law and the New Testament only grace, or because the texts are harder to read for propositionally oriented Westerners,&lt;a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or simply because of unfamiliarity on the part of many pastors, we skip over the Old Testament. We might draw on it for moral statements from time to time, or to give some extra explanation for the atonement—but when was the last time you heard someone preach through Isaiah, or Malachi, or 2 Chronicles?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a catastrophic loss to th echurch. Paul wrote that &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; Scripture was breathed out by God and is profitable for us—and the only canon he had at the time was the Old Testament; he and his fellow apostles were still in the process of composing the pieces that became the New Testament! The early church’s Bible, the texts from which they read, sang, and preached week in and week out, were those of the Old Testament. They read the Psalms together, learned from the Proverbs, chewed on Job, sought to imitate the saints of old, and above all looked for the many ways their Messiah had been proclaimed and prefigured in the pages of their book. They found there ample instruction in walking with God and worshipping their risen Lord. Matthew found there the ground of his entire gospel. Perhaps we would do well to do better in our love of the Old Testament, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is much argument about the differing genealogies in Luke and Matthew. This is an interesting discussion… for something besides a devotional post. Contrary to many a scholar, evangelical and dissenting alike, the so- called synoptic problem comes &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; dealing with each book on its own terms.&lt;a href="#fnref1"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the same books would have been present, just in a different order.&lt;a href="#fnref2"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn3"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following an article by G. K. Beale from several decades ago, a link to which I do not have at hand at the moment and which would undoubtedly bore the vast majority of you to stupor in any case.&lt;a href="#fnref3"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn4"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is an important issue here for issues of translation, and especially for the idea of “word studies”: namely, that they’re basically unhelpful. Words in different languages have different ranges of meanings. We can see this at the most basic level in the Spanish word “mesa”, which partly overlaps with the English word “table”, but extends to include things (like bluffs) which the English word does not include. This happens all the time, and accordingly just looking up all the places where a particular Greek word is used can often produce more heat than light—it will make you think that authors mean the same thing in places where the context demands that they do not. I really, really recommend that you avoid word studies for this reason.&lt;a href="#fnref4"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A factor undergoing rapid change in many parts of the West, as story becomes central again in large parts of the population.&lt;a href="#fnref5"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

As has often been noted, it includes no mention of God, nor even a reference to prayer. The closest one comes to typical Jewish religious observance is the practice of fasting under dire circumstances and the tearing of clothes and donning sackloth and ashes in their place. But these were hardly unique to the worship of Yahweh; they were common practice throughout the Ancient Near East. Moreover, the book endorsed the practice of a feast beyond those listed in the Mosaic law: a questionable practice at &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; from the perspective of many observant Jews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet here it is, in most Jewish and all Christian canons.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Again: as many commentators have noticed, Yahweh may not be mentioned by name, but his handiwork is evident throughout the book. He is not mentioned, but he is still present. His sovereignty is clear even in the absence of a prophetic declaration of his intent or activity. Indeed, for this reason I think that the book is also one of the most important books for understanding how God’s actions in ordinary life play out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Scriptures are filled with records of God’s speech to his people, and of his miraculous intervention in their lives. From this, it can be easy to draw the notion that this is the normal and ordinary course of affairs. In other words, we might after reading through the histories of Israel conclude that we should expect God to be sending prophetic messages and miracles our way on a regular basis. Indeed, large parts of the charismatic movement today are built around that very expectation. When life remains ordinary, we are inevitably disappointed. When we do not hear distinct, prophetic messages from God, we inevitably go looking for substitutes, whether in the pronouncements of famous Christians or our own “inner sense” of the Spirit’s actions—neither of which are reliable guides, as I have &lt;a href="http://2012-2013.chriskrycho.com/theology/will-of-god/"&gt;argued before&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, it is helpful to remember the circumstances under which those prophets spoke and those miracles happened. Always, they were associated with specific events in the redemptive history of the nation. Though they occasionally impinged on the life of ordinary people (like the family with whom Elisha repeatedly interacted, from miraculously overflowing oil to the resurrection of a dead child), for the most part they involved the spiritual and political leadership of the people of God. All this is true—but true &lt;em&gt;statements&lt;/em&gt; do not always communicate in the same way as do true &lt;em&gt;stories&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is this gap that Esther fills.&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Here we have a story of God’s saving his people with no divine speech, and no obvious miraculous intervention. In their place are ordinary people doing as best they can with the wisdom they have in the (dreadful) circumstances they face. Here was a moment in redemptive history, no less, with the fate of thousands of men and women hanging in the balance… where all the sorts of things we sometimes erroneously expect for the not-so- significant moments in our own lives were simply absent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not that God was absent; we see from the outcomes that his concern for his people remained (he saved them) and his judgment on their enemies remained (he destroyed them). We even see that “many from the peoples of the country declared themselves Jews, for the fear of the Jews had fallen on them” (Esther 8:17b, ESV)—not exactly a typical event in Jewish history, but certainly part of the end for which Yahweh had set them among the nations! Yet in all this, God remains behind the scenes. So it most often is in our own lives. God’s silence does not imply his absence; nor does the ordinary nature of our lives imply his uninvolvement. Quite the contrary: most of the time, in most people’s lives, in most places, God works by ordinary rather than extraordinary means. We get up, go about our day, honoring him as best we may in our various vocations, and he works &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; things to the praise of his glory and the good of those who love him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank God for Esther and Mordecai.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The existence of various canons is less troubling than many critics would suggest—not least because the core of all these canons is the same, and the extra material in them rarely leads to significant doctrinal variations. This is not to say that the distinctions are entirely unimportant, but rather to say that it is less an issue for the reliability and authority of Scripture than many naysayers would have you believe. More on this… some other day.&lt;a href="#fnref1"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not to say that this is the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; thing Esther is doing, but that it is &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; of the significant things the book does.&lt;a href="#fnref2"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

Though I have gone back and forth on the time of day in which I am best able to spend time reading the Scriptures and praying, in &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; season of life it is undeniably mornings. Our evenings are quite varied, for one thing. For another, these days I am for more awake at 6:15 in the morning than I am at 9:15 (or, as now, 10:15) at night. Thus, devotedly doing my devotions means doing them in the morning for the most part, lest I have a hard time keeping my eyes open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight’s readings in Nehemiah covered passages with which I am quite familiar, having looked at them many times. A few of them are proof texts for certain views of preaching—in particular, the way thtat the Levites gave the meaning of the text so that the people could understand it is often used to buttress support for expositional preaching. This, however, is a thoroughly ironic move hermeneutically speaking. The passage is actually indicating that the Levites were basically &lt;em&gt;translating&lt;/em&gt;, not offering explanatory commentary. Thus, it is a failure of exposition to derive proof for expository preaching from the text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of at least equal interest to me has always been the way Nehemiah responded to the people’s repentant reaction to hearing the Law of God proclaimed by Ezra. Nehemiah encouraged the people not to focus on the sorrow of what they had done, but on the joy of who their God was and what he had done on their behealf. The same exhortation, it seems to me, is one that we should think about more often. To be sure, it is good to be reminded of our sin and our failings. It is even better, however, for us to turn from looking at ourselves and to look at the Messiah who has saved us &lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt; those sins and failings. Too easily do many of us fixate on the magnitude of our sin—either thinking it too big for God to really deal with, or too small for God to concern himself with, but in any case focusing on the sin—instead of on the one who has conquered sin once and for all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May we instead learn, like Nehemiah exhorted the people, to &lt;em&gt;rejoice&lt;/em&gt; at what God has done on our behalf, and to celebrate the ways in which he has worked salvation in the midst of and through our sorrows and our foibles.&lt;/p&gt;

What is perhaps less clear is why that particular act was sinful. Was it disobedience? gaining knowledge? pride? idolatry? The most straightforward reading of Genesis 3 makes it clear that the act was sinful at the most basic level because it was disobedience, a direct rejection of the stated will of God. God tells Adam that the consequences he receives are because he ate of the tree from which he was commanded not to eat (3:17).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the more interesting question, then, is why disobedience to God is a sin. As Christians, we acknowledge that the Bible teaches us this truth. Digging deeper is helpful in understanding many things about God and the nature of both humanity and the shape of the world we inhabit. To describe why disobedience is sinful, though, requires that we first define what sin &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;. Sin is, at the most basic level, failure—missing the mark, as the Greek word would have it. The next question, then, is: &lt;em&gt;Failure at what?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sin is failure to be what humans were (and still are) meant to be—a mystery of ages, to which we have the answer. Genesis tells us exactly who we humans are. We are made in the image of God. We are to be small icons of divine glory. The divinity we are meant to recapitulate in miniature exists in perfect harmony, is completely wise and wholly good, and exercises utter sovereignty. Women and men are meant likewise to exist in true harmony, to be wise in right measure and truly good, and to exercise sovereignty in our appointed spheres. This is what it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; to be human: to do as God does in the ways he appoints in the world he made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, to &lt;em&gt;fail&lt;/em&gt; at that task is no small thing. It is to fail in the most significant way possible. Worse still, to fail as Adam and Eve did (and as we all have ever since) can only happen in a conscious act. Yes, our natures are now so corrupted that we all sin incidentally, too. But we all of us sin on purpose. Our first father and mother did not fail accidentally. They willfully rejected the very reason for their existence and spat in the face of the author of that existence. (Here is the source of the human struggle for existential meaning and the dread of meaningless that plagues us.) They rejected both the shape of reality and the one who made reality. They rebelled. They became traitors against the universe’s God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their sin, then, was not only disobedience. There are times when disobedience might be right: one &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; reject unjust commands. This, however, was not such a command. Their act of disobedience included both mistrust of most trustworthy God and self-exaltation over and against the only exalted God. God does not only demand our allegiance, he &lt;em&gt;deserves&lt;/em&gt; it. He requires our worship not because he is vain, but because to worship anything else, however lovely, is to do injury to the object of that worship, to ourselves, and to the Triune Godhead. Adam and Eve’s eating of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good represented precisely that offense. They rejected God’s sovereignty, his wisdom and goodness, and even fellowship with him. They rejected their own sphere of sovereignty, chose quick knowledge over wisdom, deceit over goodness, and treachery over communion.&lt;/p&gt;

Div.</category><category>SEBTS</category></item><item><title>From Creation to Consummation</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/from-creation-to-consummation.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Some texts are a bit more mysterious than they might at first appear. One such is Psalm 24, at least for me. The poem has three basic sections:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a declaration of Yahweh’s possession of and sovereignty over the world he made (vv. 1–2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a reflection on the character of one who may approach Yahweh (vv. 3–6)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a call to and an act of exultation in the glory of Yahweh (vv. 7–10)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first glance, there is no obvious connection between these three elements. The third might seem to follow from the first to some extent, but the emphases are all different. The first section addresses Yahweh’s rule over creation; the last enjoins gates and doors&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to worship him on the basis that he —Yahweh of hosts—is the king of glory. The middle section, on the character of those who can approach him, seems completely disconnected from either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet David, the author of the Psalm, was not an idiot. When we find passages like this in Scripture and cannot at first see how to put them together, it behooves us to take a step back and consider them at further length.&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; David intended his poem to be understood, and not by God only. The pieces &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; relate; the question is simply &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; they fit. As is the way of all good poetry, there are holes here, and they require of the audience a bit more engagement than would a direct statement of David’s intent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, these pieces do relate. Each points us to a different aspect of Yahweh’s nature. Indeed, the outline I wrote out above is actually a good summary of David’s intent here. In verses 1–2, we see that Yahweh owns the world he made. He is both creator and ruler. He is sovereign over creation, including the men and women who live in this world. Then, in verses 3–6, we see his moral character. The requirements for anyone to approach Yahweh’s holy place tell us just as much about Yahweh as about those who seek him: he is holy, he has clean hands (meaning he has not done nothing wrong), he is pure in heart, he rejects all idolatry, and he is utterly trustowrthy. Moreover, he blesses those who are like him; he makes them righteous and saves them. Finally in verses 7– 10, we see that he is glorious, strong and mighty, a king. He is not just &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; king, but &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; King of glory. He owns glory; it is his and no other’s. He is stronger than any who would oppose him. He will triumph over his enemies. He will come into the city and take up his reign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, the Psalm moves us from creation to consummation. Yahweh made and rules over the world. He calls his people to be holy, as he is holy, and he makes them righteous and saves them. He will come into his glory as the King. And David gets us there without ever coming out and saying those bare facts; the poem moves our hearts the more thoroughly because he makes us work for us, and because he does so with such aching beauty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lift up your heads, O gates!&lt;br /&gt;
    And lift them up, O ancient doors,&lt;br /&gt;
    that the King of glory may come in.&lt;br /&gt;
Who is this King of glory?&lt;br /&gt;
    Yahweh of hosts,&lt;br /&gt;
    he is the King of glory! Selah. (Psalm 24:9–10)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hallelujah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over-familiarity with the text has also perhaps dulled us to the curiosity of this exhortation. Perhaps there was something going on culturally we are missing today, but this is the only place in Scripture that anyone addresses gates and doors, to my knowledge.&lt;a href="#fnref1"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, that assumes we are paying enough attention to recognize that the poem is doing something unusual in the first place—and, dare I say it, we too rarely are paying heed so closely.&lt;a href="#fnref2"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My son, give me your heart,&lt;br /&gt;
    and let your eyes observe my ways.&lt;br /&gt;
For a prostitue is a deep pit;&lt;br /&gt;
    a foreign woman is a narrow well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Proverbs 23:26–27, ESV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The latter half of Ezra explains how it is that the people of Israel &lt;a href="/2014/justice-mercy-same-stroke/"&gt;turned away&lt;/a&gt; from their pattern of idolatry—and it wasn’t pretty or easy. After the people began building the temple again under the leadership of Haggai and Zechariah, after the favor shown to the Jews by the kings Darius and Artaxerxes, and after Ezra made his God-favored journey from Babylon to Jerusalem bearing more gifts and entrusted to teach the people the law, everything once again nearly went wrong because of an old pattern the Jews were embracing. Despite the clear instruction of the Law of Yahweh, they were intermarrying with the people around them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The instruction not to intermarry was not racism, even if some abused it to that end. Those who did missed the point entirely, for Yahweh had always welcomed the outsider into his people. Indeed, the very existence of Israel was predicated on Yahweh’s choosing for himself someone who was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; following him. Likewise, the kingly line had in it multiple outsiders (most notably Rahab and Ruth). No, the point was not the superiority of the Jews over the people around them—a notion that their history should have made clear was laughable in any case—but the protection of their &lt;em&gt;worship&lt;/em&gt;. Every time that Israelites began intermarrying with the people around them, they also began following the worship practices of the people around them. They started worshipping idols, every single time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the prohibition on intermarriage was not a matter of racial distinction, but of religious distinction, and Israel’s history bore out the necessity of the policy. Yet in Ezra 9, we find that once again they were slipping into the same old pattern. Ezra’s response might be startling without that history. Even apart from a pattern of this same folly, though, his response is the right one from a shepherd when God’s people disobey him. There is a lesson here for pastors and ministers: Ezra’s first response was grief and a prayer of corporate repentance. Only after offering that prayer did he move to deal with the sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mundane&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; response Ezra made is interesting and has been much debated, given God’s stated opposition to divorce. While we might speculate about the outcomes of the decision for the women and children affected by requiring these Israelite men to put them away, we have no grounds to do so. Certainly we can say that the right thing for these men to do would have been to provide for the families they had created, even while no longer having them as spouses. As to what they actually did, though, we simply have no basis for speaking one way or another. What we can say with confidence is that Ezra’s actions here underscore the seriousness with which he took keeping the Law of God. Holiness mattered to him—and not just his own personal holiness, but the holiness of the people of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it ought to be for us, especially those of us who seek to be teachers and leaders within the church. If we are to be the bride of Christ, we must seek to be &lt;em&gt;wholly&lt;/em&gt; pure. A bride does not care only that her face and one of her dress sleeves are white; she cares that her whole appearance is radiant and beautiful when she meets her groom. So let us diligently pursue both our own holiness and that of our brothers and sisters in Christ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id="fn2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have chosen “mundane” rather than “practical” because the two are not the same, and the latter would imply that Ezra’s prayer was not practical, when in fact prayer is often the most practical thing we can do.&lt;a href="#fnref2"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

Though some of the pages are taken up with similar, &lt;a href="/2014/grappling-%20with-genealogies/"&gt;uninteresting(-at-least-to-us)&lt;/a&gt; details of the number of people who returned from the Exile to rebuild the temple of God under the command of Cyrus, other parts of this passage indicate the significant change that had taken place in the people of Judah and Benjamin and Levi during their sojourn far from their homes. In short: they had learned not to worship other gods. This becomes increasingly clear throughout Ezra-Nehemiah, and as one comes to the New Testament it is obvious that the lesson did indeed stick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that the Jews had no ongoing religious issues. They did, to be sure. But these issues were not the issue of idolatry, at least in the strict sense of the word. Tim Keller would likely argue that the issues they had were still matters of idolatry of a sort, and I would be inclined to agree with him; but in any case, they were no longer putting up Asherah poles or making sacrifices to Baal or Molech. There were many consequences of the Exile, including the end of the Davidic line of kings over Judah, the loss of the Ark of the Covenant, and the destruction of the First Temple. Most important of all, though, was this reality that the Jews never again engaged in large-scale worship of gods besides Yahweh. Their functional henotheism gave way at last to true monotheism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is amazing to me—and wonderful—that the result of God’s judgment was not only the punishment of the judged but also their hearts being changed. He used a dreadful consequence to bring about real, lasting change in his people. It strikes me that sometimes we see exactly this, albeit on a smaller scale, in our own lives. There are times when we run far astray, and in his &lt;em&gt;mercy&lt;/em&gt; he judges us, so that we will return to him. Now, there is a final judgment beyond which there is no return, but in the interval, how great his grace! This is a double blessing to us who follow Christ: First, it reminds us that if we stray, he is faithful to send opportunity after opportunity (usually increasingly &lt;em&gt;painful&lt;/em&gt; opportunity) for our repentance. Second, it gives us reason not to go astray at all, realizing that the further we run, the more difficult will be our judgment. In both, we are reminded to worship our God: who judges justly and mercifully in the same stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*[henotheism]: the belief in and worship of a single God while accepting the existence or possible existence of other deities that may also be worshipped. (see Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henotheism)&lt;/p&gt;

Over and over again, kings rise and fall; generation to generation, the fortunes of the people rise and fall with their fidelity to Yahweh. From Hezekiah’s reliance on Yahweh and God’s corresponding triumph over the armies of Sennacherib of Assyria, to the final end of the Judaic kingdom&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the rebellions of Jehoiakim and Jehoiachin, the same themes that dominated the rest of the book are on full display here. Reliance on Yahweh leads to salvation and deliverance. Abandoning Yahweh leads to destruction. The narrative of human history, personal and corporate, played out time and again in the public history of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many things that could be said of these chapters, but two points in particular caught my attention, both of which have been present throughout the book and so warrant some remarks here at the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the transition from generation to generation was rarely smooth. I do not mean merely the actual intrigues of the courts, of which there were clearly quite a few, what with multiple kings suffering assassination at the hands of their promptly-executed servants. Rather, I mean the spiritual succession. There are a few generations recorded here where multiple successive kings followed Yahweh wholeheartedly. Mostly, though, the kings bounced back and forth between fidelity and faithlessness (with no few examples of simple vacillation). Each father’s son charted his own course. As a father myself, this is simultaneously a cause for hope and reason to pray the more faithfully for my own children. I must pray for them and seek earnestly to make disciples of them because there is no guarantee that they will follow Christ simply because I do. By the same token, there is hope that they will walk with God despite my own failings and follies. No child is doomed or blessed to walk her father’s path; she makes her own choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second is the sheer efficacy of the Scriptures. Every time that the people were confronted with the word of God, they moved to repentance. They tore down idols, repaired the temple, and engaged once again in the practices outlined by the Law for purification and sacrifices. Time and again, it was the word of God that convicted people. It is tempting to try to stir people up to love and good works by our own efforts, but nothing we do will ever be as effective as the word of God, which is the Spirit’s appointed means for sanctifying his people. For every minister in the world, and indeed for every believer in the world, this ought to be an enormous encouragement. We do not need to be people of unusual skill at public speaking, or especially effective debators. We simply need to know the word of God and lean hard on it, trusting that the Holy Spirit will use it. Yes, we should grow in our knowledge and understanding, and seek to become more skillful in the ways in which we interact with others. Ultimately, though, it is God’s words that prove effective for turning people to him. That is good news indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, there was a “king” in Judea later, but the domain of which Herod was a representative was not Judaic or Davidic but instituted by outsiders for their own ends.&lt;a href="#fnref1"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who can say, “I have made my heart pure;&lt;br /&gt;
    I am clean from my sin“?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Proverbs 20:9, ESV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet again, the annals of the kings of Judah point to the need for a different kind of king—one who is faithful in the long run. Joash was a boy when he became king, rescued from the threat of death at the hands of his own power-mad grandmother by a faithful priest. For the days of that priest, he remained faithful, but after his death, he fell so far that he had that priest’s son murdered for daring to “speak truth to power” in pointing out the folly of Joash’s idolatry. How far must one fall to kill the son of the man who saved your life and put you on the throne? Yet this is how idolatry works. It corrupts and twists our senses, until we call evil good and good evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when he was strong, he grew proud, to his destruction. For he was unfaithful to the &lt;span class="smcp"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; his God and entered the temple of the &lt;span class="smcp"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; to burn incense on the altar of incense. (2 Chronicles 26:16, ESV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uzziah follows the same pattern laid out by so many kings of Judah before him. He started well, but finished badly. Of the many themes of the book of Chronicles, one that comes home time and again is the risk of setting out to follow God and being turned aside in the course of life. Deadliest of all the lures for these kings was always the temptation to pride and confidence in their own strength. I see this, watching successful men and women today. How often do we choose people to lead us because we recognize their godliness and character, and then see them stumble into folly as pride consumes them? Too often. The example stands as a warning to all of us, but especially to any who wish to lead. If God grants us success—especially the kind of success so prized by the world and by our flesh—we must be doubly wary against the poisonous seeds of pride that so easily take root in our hearts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most striking here is the particular way in which Uzziah fell. In this case, it was not as in so many others a matter of folly in battle. Rather, it was folly in worship. Uzziah seems to have come under the impression that his military victories indicated such a degree of God’s favor—such a degree of his own righteousness before God—that he could disregard the ways God had commanded his people to approach him. He disregarded the supreme holiness of God, and took lightly the laws that Yahweh had laid out. It cost him everything on which he had prided himself; he spent the end of his life a leper alone. God’s response to Uzziah’s actions here serve as a stark reminder to me not to take worship lightly, and not to dishonor God by taking &lt;em&gt;him&lt;/em&gt; lightly. He is holy, and we ought never dare to trifle with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steadfast love and faithfulness preserve the king&lt;br /&gt;
    and by steadfast love his throne is upheld.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Proverbs 20:28)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whose steadfast love and faithfulness preserve a king, and whose steadfast love upholds the throne of a king? It is Yahweh: a God merciful and gracious, abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness. It is the king who is above all the other kings. Proverbs points in unison with the Chronicles to the Messianic king. Praise be to God for his work in Christ Jesus. Hallelujah for a king who will &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; turn his back on his God or on his people, who will not lead the people into idolatry or presumptuous worship, but who is himself &lt;em&gt;able&lt;/em&gt; to serve as priest, prophet, and king.&lt;/p&gt;

Accordingly, both of us learned at relatively young ages to practice memorizing verses from the Bible. We may not have been AWANA champions, but both of us have a good bit of the Bible stored in our memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During college, as I studied the Bible and studied hermeneutics, I became increasingly convinced that the approach I had been taking to memorizing Scripture was, if not exactly &lt;em&gt;unhelpful&lt;/em&gt; (learning the Bible is a good move, full stop), nonetheless not nearly as helpful as it could be. Specifically, my emphasis on memorizing a verse here and a verse there—even when I went so far as to memorize the whole sentence—seemed to me to prevent me from really remembering the full meaning of the passage in question. Several times, I discovered that a verse I had memorized meant something other than what I had thought, as I studied its context carefully. It did not take but a few of these incidents for me to decide that I wanted to try something different. Accordingly, I decided to stoip memorizing individual verses or short passages, and to try instead to memorize a book of the Bible. That way, every single verse would automatically be in context for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are probably thinking I was crazy, and/or (for those of you who know me well) that it is a typically over-the-top Chris Krycho thing to do. In some ways that might be true, at least in the details of my implementation: I jumped in with Hebrews, since it is one of my favorite books in the Bible. Things were actually going fairly well with that project; I had succesfully memorized up through chapter 7 and was working on verse 8… and then I graduated from college. Suddenly, the 15–20 minutes each day in which I had been accustomed to walking around on campus—the time in which I had been practicing my Scripture memory—was gone. I fell out of the habit, and never finished memorizing the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward three and a half years. Jaimie and I moved to North Carolina, and we started attending and soon joined &lt;a href="http://www.fbcdurham.org/"&gt;First Baptist Church of Durham&lt;/a&gt;. During our membership class, we received an interesting little booklet written by our senior pastor, Andy Davis, &lt;a href="http://www.fbcdurham.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Scripture-Memory-Booklet-for-Publication-Website-Layout.pdf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;An Approach to Extended Memorization of Scripture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Curious, I read through it that evening. Pastor Davis outlined there both the benefits of memorizing Scripture and—to my surprise and interest—basically the same concerns I had had about memorizing individual passages out of context. But then he did something profoundly helpful: he also provided a practical, straightforward system to help people learn to memorize extended sections of Scripture (i.e. &lt;em&gt;books&lt;/em&gt;). And not just crazy, over-the-top, intense people like Chris Krycho. Ordinary, not so strange people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last fall, Jaimie and I started trying to memorize Philippians together. However, we did not have a system or a plan, and the attempt ended up going off the rails. We were moving at different paces, we were not helping each other review, and the whole thing eventually just sort of slid to a halt in the face of our busy lives and our lack of a plan. As part of our start to the new year, though, I suggested that we look at Pastor Davis’ materials and see if they would work for us. As it turns out, they do—they work really, really well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jaimie and I are 12 verses into Colossians 1, two weeks along. The system, simple as it is, has been easy to keep up each day, and has helped us stay in sync. We review together pretty much every day, and it has been a real joy. Picking a shorter book helps a lot, too: it feels more doable. By the time our next child is born in early June (Lord willing), we will have finished the book and be reviewing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic system itself is simple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pick a book. (Start short. Dr. Davis recommends Ephesians, and I certainly wouldn’t go longer than that.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Day 1: read 1:1 ten times out loud, then repeat it ten times from memory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Day 2: repeat 1:1 ten times from memory, checking the text if you need to. Once you finish that, read 1:2 ten times out loud, and then repeat it ten times from meory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Days 3 and following: repeat all previously memorized verses once from memory. Then repeat the previous day’s verse 10 times from memory. Then read the next verse ten times out loud, and then repeat it ten times from memory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This way, one always reviews previous material in the book, but without it taking overly long. For example, on day 6, one would review 1:1–5 from memory, say 1:5 another 9 times out loud from memory, read 1:6 out loud ten times, and then repeat 1:6 ten times from memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be honest, this system works &lt;em&gt;far&lt;/em&gt; better than the approach I had been taking on my own, both when I was memorizing Hebrews years ago and when I was working on Philippians last fall. The specific, active repetition helps solidify the verses in my head, which is important, especially because there are some verses that are just hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pastor Davis outlines a good deal more in his &lt;a href="http://www.fbcdurham.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Scripture-Memory-Booklet-for-Publication-Website-Layout.pdf"&gt;booklet&lt;/a&gt;, including arguing for the value of memorizing Scripture, why tackling longer stretches is helpful, and discussing both how to learn longer books and how to remember the books one has already learned. I commend this approach to you, even as I urge you strongly to consider making Scripture memory a regular spiritual discipline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We actually tried starting this in the fall. It didn’t work out so well. Keep reading.&lt;a href="#fnref1"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are not persuaded, I am not here going to make a full attempt to persuade you. Suffice it to say that I find it enormously helpful to have God’s revelation stored up in my mind—I find that the Holy Spirit often uses it to convict me or encourage me throughout the day, and that it is incredibly valuable in interacting with others, whether building up fellow believers or speaking with those who do not believe.&lt;a href="#fnref2"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

This is no small thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Death and life are in the power of the tongue,&lt;br /&gt;
    and those who love it will eat its fruits. (Proverbs 18:21)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though I have sometimes heard this verse misused (as though to suggest a mystical power in our speech—a view for which I think there is no warrant), the plain meaning alone is enough to give a person with my proclivities pause. If my one of my chief follies is the tendency to speak too freely and without sufficient consideration, what death have I wrought? Where might I have brought life instead? When I speak with Jaimie or with Ellie, when having long talks with friends, when offering my thoughts publicly, my words matter. &lt;em&gt;All&lt;/em&gt; words matter. Jesus warned the Pharisees (and warns us, lest we be like them):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tell you, on the day of judgment people will give account for every careless word they speak, for by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned. (Matthew 12:36–37, ESV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The words one chooses to use—the words &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; choose to use—can build others up or cut them down. They can encourage, or they can wound. They can bring life or death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fool takes no pleasure in understanding,&lt;br /&gt;
    but only in expressing his opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fool’s lips walk into a fight,&lt;br /&gt;
    and his mouth invites a beating.&lt;br /&gt;
A fool’s mouth is his ruin,&lt;br /&gt;
    and his lips are a snare to his soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If one gives an answer before he hears,&lt;br /&gt;
    it is his folly and shame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Proverbs 18:2, 6–7, 13)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a bit painful to think how often I have been a fool in these terms. It is a caution to me in writing these very posts. Yes, it is good to take time to reflect on the things I am learning from the Scriptures. It is, I think, profitable to post these particular reflections publicly.&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; There is, however, a serious danger that my writing could be an act of folly, and the more so the quicker I am to write before carefully considering the matter at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I write on Scripture, I have one sort of responsibility: to honor the text, and in so doing to honor the one who authored the text. Few of us should seek to be teachers, because we will be held to a higher standard of judgment for our words. If I speak falsely of Scripture, there is a real chance that I will do harm to others’ spiritual health. When I write on other topics, I have a different sort of responsibility, but one no less weighty for that. If I publicly opine on politics, address personal situations in our lives, or discuss the contours of evangelical Christianity, my words will undoubtedly be read by people who stand either to benefit or to be injured by those words. Again: to write without careful consideration would be to risk bringing spiritual harm. In both cases, I would be in danger of dishonoring the God who gave us words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is particularly important for those of us who love words. I am obsessed with the beauty and power of human language, awed by the gift God bestowed on us in the creative potential of phonemes and clauses and sentences and paragraphs. I can (and, my friends can all wearily attest, &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt;) wax eloquent at the drop of a pin. This delight is a good thing; it is a part of the &lt;em&gt;imago dei&lt;/em&gt; in me. Yet my words are not to be their own ends. They, like I myself, exist for a cause greater than that. They are meant to serve God. If they do not, they will bring death. If they do, they will bring life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only other repeated warning I have considered as carefully is that on sexual immorality—an area in which all young people are especially tempted.&lt;a href="#fnref1"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would not necessarily be profitable to post &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; reflection publicly. Some of them would do the public no good, and posting them would be only a way of seeking attention in a way that would feed those selfsame sins. Confession is good. But confession is done with brothers and sisters in close fellowship—not with the world at large.&lt;a href="#fnref2"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

I fell asleep just after reading said chapters—so the &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; important aspect of this project, I still accomplished. Huzzah. As for why I got to it so late (and why I am again tonight)… that will have to wait for next Tuesday to explain.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great deal of the latter parts of the Chronicles—as in Kings—are concerned with the deeds men who decided &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to submit to Yahweh. Solomon’s son, Rehoboam, set the tone for much of what followed. He began by obeying and worshiping God, but all too soon he went his own way. The Chronicler summarizes Rehoboam’s turn in a single sentence that I found strikingly provocative:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the rule of Rehoboam was established and he was strong, he abaondoned the law of the &lt;span class="smcp"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, and all Israel with him. (2 Chronicles 12:1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His deeds bore this out. Whereas in the beginning of his reign Rehoboam was sensible enough to obey Yahweh when God spoke to the king through a prophet and warned him not to go to war with Jeroboam of Israel, his habits had changed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were continual wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam (2 Chronicles 12:15b)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right there we have a perfect summary not only of the folly of so many kings of Judah in the years that followed Rehoboam, but of many of us as well. We turn to God in desperation in times of trouble, or when we are seeking security, but as soon as times are good and things seem to be going well with us, we are quick to abandon him. We begin to disobey, deciding our way is better and relying on our own wisdom. Never mind that we came to whatever point of success we have achieved only because God granted it to us in his grace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next chapter records the reign of Rehoboam’s son Ahijah—a man who, it seems, recognized the power of Yahweh but did not fully submit to his rule. He happily relied on Yahweh when waging war, but (like his father, grandfather Solomon, and great-grandfather David before him) he rejected God’s law when it came to taking multiple wives.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; This sort of going halfway &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; seems to characterize us all too frequently. We are happy to accept God’s help, and may even be zealous for him in some ways, but too often are unwilling to submit to his law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahijah’s son Asa provides one more picture of a way that we often go wrong. He began exceedingly well. He relied on Yahweh for victory in war, and he also faithfully pursued his ways at home. He led Judah to break down their altars to other gods and pledge themselves to the worship of Yahweh, the one true God. He exiled even his own grandmother because of her devotion to idols. In short, if we had only chapter 15, we would think Asa a model king—but the Chronicler adds an unhappy ending to the story. As Asa grew old, he turned away from the wisdom of his youth and decided to rely not on the strength of God for his country’s defense but on his own political machinations and the strength in arms of neighboring nations.&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; That he was now going thoroughly off the rails becomes quite clear as one reads that he tortured the priest who told him that Yahweh disapproved of his treaty, and that he refused even in his illness to seek God’s aid. There is a warning here: starting well does not guarantee one will finish well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over and over again, as one reads through the Chronicles with Yahweh’s resounding promise to David in mind—that promise of a son whose throne would be established forever—one is left disappointed. Beginning with Solomon, every single king misses the mark in some way. Either he flatly rejects Yahweh, or he simply finds an area in which he will not obey, or he falls away from wisdom as he ages. On and on go their follies—the defects in character and failings in every virtue. But in this way, Rehoboam, Ahijah, and Asa all serve us still. They point us to the one king who did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; fail, the man from the line of David, of the tribe of Judah, the great-grandson of Abraham, the offspring of the woman, born of a woman. That king never sinned. No matter how many years passed, he remained steadfast in the face of temptation to err (and remains steadfast in his prayers for us). He has but one bride, whom he awaits still. Jesus the Messiah is that King.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it is just me, but the idea of having multiple wives is somewhat terrifying. Jaimie is more than enough mystery for one lifetime. I think two women would leave me confounded without ceasing.&lt;a href="#fnref1"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that making alliances is not an inherently ungodly thing to do. The trick was that here it &lt;em&gt;clearly&lt;/em&gt; demonstrated Asa’s lack of faith in Yahweh to save Judah, standing in rather stark contrast to his behavior in his youth.&lt;a href="#fnref2"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

It points us simultaneously to whom we ought to aim to be as we strive to be holy as God is holy, and to Christ, the only one who has ever perfectly walked out these words. Walking through the passage tonight provided an opportunity both to pray for the Holy Spirit to make me more like these words, and to worship the Holy One of God who has actually fulfilled them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David opens with a provocative, challenging question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh &lt;span class="smcp"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, who shall sojourn in your tent?&lt;br /&gt;
    Who shall dwell on your holy hill?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Psalm 15:1, ESV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who indeed? The Psalms have already shown us&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the image of a holy God who will brook no injustice and who hates sin passionately, but who is also the covenant-keeper and salvation of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He who walks blamelessly and does what is right&lt;br /&gt;
    and speaks truth in his heart; …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Psalm 15:2, ESV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is quite the target to hit already. Who &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; walks blameless and does what is right? Not I. Who is &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; self-deceived (still less never deceitful toward others)? Again, not I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…who does not slander with his tongue&lt;br /&gt;
    and does no evil to his neighbor,&lt;br /&gt;
    nor takes up a reproach against his friend; …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Psalm 15:3, ESV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of us have slandered our neighbors and taken up a reproach against friends. We have spoken cruelly of those we love, been harsh in our assessments of people over whom we have no such right to stand in judgment. We have been unkind to friends and held against them their sins. All of us have done evil to our neighbors—there is no one among us who has escaped and managed to avoid ever harming anyone near us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…in whose eyes a vile person is despised,&lt;br /&gt;
    but who honors those who fear the Lord…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Psalm 15:4a, ESV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many of us can truly say that we have this kind of heart—that we always earnestly oppose those who rebel against God, and honor those who fear Him? Again: not I. Too often I make excuses for those who do not know God, rather than call their idolatrous and treacherous way of life as it is. Too often I am impatient and unkind and derogatory toward those who &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; walk with God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;who swears to his own hurt and does not change;&lt;br /&gt;
    who does not put out his money at interest&lt;br /&gt;
and does not take a bribe against the innocent.&lt;br /&gt;
    He who does these things shall never be moved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Psalm 15:4b–5, ESV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many of us have made a promise and then gone back on it because it became inconvenient? How many of us have, if not literally charged interest, then held it against people when it took them a long time to pay us back on money we lent them? To what extent are we &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; complicit in crimes against the innocent, even when we ourselves have kept our hands clean—just by dint of our lives in a fallen world, as part of a fallen nation, where every year sees innocent lives lost at our hands?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is not much hope for any of us to stand on God’s holy hill even for a moment—still less to dwell there forever. But Christ has measured up to every line that David raised, and gone beyond them. He stands in our stead, his righteousness granted to us, our failings taken on his own body. His Spirit empowers us to pursue this kind of life: fleeing sin and pursuing the holiness of God. May we seek to look more like Christ, who alone has the right to sojourn in Yahweh’s tent and who alone has the right to dwell on his holy hill —but who has invited all of us in to the feast in that temple and to sit at his feet and eat the bread that satisfies on his mountain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;section class="footnotes"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I take the view that the Psalms, in addition to being valuable in their own right individually, were organized by an editor who knew what he or she was about. That editor’s decisions about where to put the Psalms is often illuminating—much as it is with any other collection.&lt;a href="#fnref1"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Often the two come right next to each other,&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and are both made all the more illuminating by way of the juxtaposition. The book’s pages also include no few beautiful gems of insight into the human condition. Some of each caught my attention tonight as I read through Proverbs 14.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="on-the-human-condition" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;On the human condition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heart knows its own bitterness,&lt;br /&gt;
    and no stranger shares its joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Proverbs 14:10, ESV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And again:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even in laughter the heart may ache,&lt;br /&gt;
    and the end of joy may be grief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Provebs 14:13, ESV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of these speak to realities we have all experienced. To be human in a fallen world is to be lonely at times—to know that one’s heart can never be shared perfectly with another. There are times when our hearts ache with this knowledge: because our grief is so deep that we wish another could partake of it with us and so ease the ache, and because our hearts are so full of gladness that we wish another could partake of it with us and so share the merriment. But we cannot. We are sundered from one another. But not finally so. We were made for better than this. Some day we will taste of it. In the long wait until that day, we may content ourselves with this: that very God of very God has drunk the bowl of our grief and supped with us in joy-making—we are known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="practical-insights" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Practical insights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A truthful witness saves lives,&lt;br /&gt;
    but one who breathes out lies is deceitful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Proverbs 14:25, ESV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one seems both straightforward and obvious to me. It is interesting, though, that the author makes the point that the truthful witness &lt;em&gt;saves lives&lt;/em&gt;. It reminds me that our lenient age, with death a rare punishment for any crime, no matter how severe, is very different from almost every other. The word of a witness, in those days, meant the difference between a man being stoned to death and his going home to his family. Yet it is no less important today. I read recently of a case of wrongful conviction—a man sentenced to prison for a crime he did not commit, which it is now &lt;em&gt;known&lt;/em&gt; he did not commit, and still he cannot get out of jail—and all this because of a false testimony delivered on the stand many decades ago.&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Our words still have the power to make or ruin lives. Sometimes these are dramatic moments; other times they are the many little moments that add up to a larger shift in the course of one’s life. Either way, telling the truth matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="theological-profundities" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Theological profundities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the fear of the &lt;span class="smcp"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; one has strong confidence,&lt;br /&gt;
    and his children will have a refuge.&lt;br /&gt;
The fear of the &lt;span class="smcp"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; is a fountain of life,&lt;br /&gt;
    that one may turn away from the snares of death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Proverbs 14:26–27, ESV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These verses remind me in the sharpest terms that fearing Yahweh is essential to my own spiritual health and that of my family. Fearing him is confidence, refuge, life, escape from the snares of death. What would it mean, then, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to fear God? And make no mistake: fear here is more than mere reverence. God is holy, and his wrath burns hot against sin; we &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; fear him. Not in contradistinction to loving him, though. Note that it is precisely in fearing Yahweh that one has confidence and refuge and life and salvation!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next one is of a rather different kind, but its anthropological theology is striking:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoever oppresses a poor man insults his Maker,&lt;br /&gt;
   but he who is generous to the needy honors him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Proverbs 14:31, ESV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God so cares about the poor, that to oppress poor people is to insult him. He so loves the needy that being generous to them is to honor him. I think many Christians who are both theologically and politically conservative fail to take these kinds of words sufficiently seriously. Whatever the case may be for others, I know &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; have failed to take them with all the gravity these words carry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="striking-contrasts" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Striking contrasts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The poor is disliked even by his neighbor,&lt;br /&gt;
    but the rich has many friends.&lt;br /&gt;
Whoever despises his neighbor is a sinner,&lt;br /&gt;
    but blessed is he who is generous to the poor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Proverbs 14:20-21, ESV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first stanza is one of those straightforward, practical observations on the way things are in this broken world. It is simply &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt; that people look down on those who are poor, and that wealth earns friendship (of a sort). It is not &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; that this is so. But still it is so. The second stanza shows up this reality for what it is, though: a reflection of a broken reality. The man who scorns his neighbor—no matter the cause, but as we have seen perhaps &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; if for poverty—sins in doing so. The man who gives generously to the poor is blessed. The contrast between the broken world in which we live and the holy ways of God to which we are called could not be clearer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, I am increasingly grateful for the Proverbs. I appreciate more and more Solomon’s (and others’) skill in composing them, and the editor’s skill in arranging them so thoughtfully. Praise God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It strikes me that we evangelicals—ever jetting between the poles of abstruse dogmatics and applied pragmatics—would do well to spend a bit more time on the way the Proverbs marry the two.&lt;a href="#fnref1"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

Of all the great turns in the march of God’s plan, this one is right up there with those that happened in the lives of Adam and Eve, Noah, Abraham, and Moses. David brought the ark of the covenant to Jerusalem and instituted the ritual&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of worship that was to characterize the place where God’s presence would dwell thenceforth—a ritual that would produce many of the psalms and that would shape the best of the life of faithful Hebrews for generations to come. Then, Yahweh God blessed David with a covenant promise that far exceeded anything David did (or could have done) for his creator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is worth quoting Yahweh’s promise to David at length, to see just how central this promise was to be in the history of God’s plan for saving the world:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Moreover, I declare to you that the &lt;span class="smcp"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; will build you a house.&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; When your days are fulfilled to walk with your fathers, I will raise up your offspring&lt;a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; after you, one of your own sons, and I will establish his kingdom. He shall build a house for me, and I will establish his throne forever. I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son. I will not take my steadfast love from him, as I took it from him who was before you, but I will confirm him in my house and in my kingdom forever, and his throne shall be stablished forever.” (1 Chronicles 17:10b–14)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of this finds its first fulfillment in David’s son Solomon, of course. Solomon built a temple for God, and Yahweh did fill it with his presence. Solomon, despite his wandering ways, continued to receive the blessings of God. However, even a casual reading of the rest of &lt;em&gt;this book&lt;/em&gt;—the Chronicles— immediately raises the question: How, exactly, will this promise be fulfilled if the Davidic line of kings ended when the Jews were exiled to Babylon?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New Testament makes it clear, of course: this promise finds its ultimately fulfillment in Jesus Christ. The Messiah &lt;em&gt;fills up&lt;/em&gt; a promise that had its first satisfaction in Solomon, but which was left unfinished in that king, great though he was. Jesus is the king whose throne is and will be established forever, from whom the Father’s steadfast love with never be removed, and who indeed &lt;a href="/2014/temple-for-god.html" title="A Temple For God"&gt;built a house&lt;/a&gt; for God. Jesus is the one of whom the Father said, “I will be to him a father, and he will be to me a son” (see Hebrews 1:5).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But of course, just as the Hebrews were waiting with longing for a Messiah to come and fulfill this promise in the long years between the Exile and the coming of Christ, so we are awaiting the Messiah’s coming in these long years between the Ascension and the Eschaton. The King is seated at the right hand of the Majesty on high (Hebrews 1:3), but he has not yet come to claim the whole of his kingdom. But in the interval, we follow David’s lead:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sing to the &lt;span class="smcp"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, all the earth!&lt;br /&gt;
    Tell of his salvation from day to day.&lt;br /&gt;
Declare his glory among the nations,&lt;br /&gt;
    his marvelous works among all the peoples!&lt;br /&gt;
For great is the &lt;span class="smcp"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, and greatly to be praised,&lt;br /&gt;
    and he is to be held in awe above all gods.&lt;br /&gt;
For all the gods of the peoples are idols,&lt;br /&gt;
    but the &lt;span class="smcp"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; made the heavens,&lt;br /&gt;
Splendor and majesty are before him;&lt;br /&gt;
    strength and joy are in his place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hallelujah. Maranatha.&lt;a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="refs" class="references"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;section class="footnotes"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Used here in the purely descriptive sense. Though we can all fall into &lt;em&gt;dead&lt;/em&gt; ritual, where we practice the mere outward forms of things with no motion of our will in line with the motions of our bodies, not all ritual is dead. Nor is all ritual bad. When our worship is &lt;em&gt;reduced&lt;/em&gt; to ritual, we have a problem, but ritual-less worship is anarchy and chaos at best.&lt;a href="#fnref1"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m skipping over this for the sake of brevity, but I find it really remarkable that when David plans to build God a house, God sends a prophet and tells David, “No, &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; am going to build &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; a house.” Here is a small picture of the gospel: God does for us what we are not worthy to do for him.&lt;a href="#fnref2"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn3"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Offspring” here is the same word (“seed”) used in the promise that the “offspring” of the woman would bruise the serpent’s head and that the through “offspring” of Abraham the nations would be blessed.&lt;a href="#fnref3"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn4"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Come soon!”&lt;a href="#fnref4"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Sleep is calling, but diligence in seeking God is a good I will not be quick to overlook.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoever loves discipline hates knowledge&lt;br /&gt;
    but he who hates reproof is stupid. (Proverbs 12:1, ESV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It strikes me that this verse could serve as a heading for much of Proverbs, and unfortunately for much of many of our lives. It is easy to hate reproof, because it is easy to hate being wrong, because it is easy to be prideful and resistant to correction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deceit is in the heart of the wicked,&lt;br /&gt;
    but those who plan peace have joy. (Proverbs 12:20, ESV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This verse—and many like it throughout the Psalms—makes it clear that the &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; things may contrast with wickedness. Though wickedness has a relatively short list of characteristics in the Proverbs (murder and deception above all), the things contrasted with the behavior of the wicked is nearly infinite. The list includes wisdom, righteousness, peace, joy, and life, to name but a few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the poor are plundered, because the needy groan,&lt;br /&gt;
    “I will now arise,” says the &lt;span class="smcp"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;
    “I will place him in the saftey for which he longs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though I do not buy into “liberation theology”, thinking as I do that its proponents tend to dramatically oversell their own case while ignoring entirely the Biblical witness toward the individual nature of redemption and the salvific work of Christ at Calvary, verses like this (and indeed: Psalms like this) remind us that the liberation position &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; have something going for it. Namely, it takes seriously something that Scripture takes seriously: God’s particular and especial concern for the poor and needy, not least those abused by people with more power than them. We would do well to integrate this thread more thoroughly into our evangelical conception of the world and our responsibilities thereto. We need not diminish our clear proclamation of the gospel nor mute our insistence on the centrality, supremacy, and sufficiency of Christ in order to set our hands to work diligently for the good of the poor and needy. We need not throw out penal substitutionary atonement to acknowledge that God &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; show particular concern for the poor and downtrodden.&lt;/p&gt;

We marvel: you are the lord of light and of life, the maker of heaven and earth; you have set your glory above the heavens, and yet you are mindful of men and women like us. And not only mindful! You delight in us and love us in spite of our rebellion against you. You gave infinitely of yourself that we might be redeemed. Oh Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we have gathered here to worship, and as we bring you these gifts, we remember that everything we give to you is yours already. You do not &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; anything of us; everything in all the world is yours already. All that we have we have from you—not only our possessions, but even our lives—so we pray that you be exalted in our giving, in our singing, and in the preached word. May we be those who in our giving gladly demonstrate that you are more precious to us than the things of this world. May Christ be exalted in our own hearts, in the work of this congregation, in the lives of the members of this church, in the community around us, and in the efforts of missionaries around the world as we give. Thank you so much for your steadfast love toward us!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray all these things in the name of Jesus Christ our risen Lord. Amen.&lt;/p&gt;

</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chris Krycho</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jan 2014 11:15:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:www.chriskrycho.com,2014-01-12:2014/prayer-thanksgiving-jan-12-2014.html</guid><category>prayers</category></item><item><title>Saul and David/Righteousness and Folly</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/saul-david-righteousness-folly.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;The books of Chronicles serve as something of a parallel and supplementary account to the books of 1 and 2 Samuel and 1 and 2 Kings.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; There are a few significant differences between the books, though. First, Samuel and Kings take considerable time to trace out Saul’s history and then divided their attention fairly evenly between Judah and Israel, with a slight emphasis on Israel because of Elijah and Elisha’s ministries there. The Chronicles skip almost entirely over Saul and focus predominantly on the Davidic line in Judah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, Samuel and Kings generally let events speak for themselves, with little commentary. Yahweh is always in control, but the author rarely provides explicit theological interpretation of the events recorded. The Chronicles, rather strikingly, &lt;em&gt;often&lt;/em&gt; make straightforward claims about divine action and provide moral commentary on the events they record. After its long list of &lt;a href="/theology/grappling-with-genealogies.html"&gt;genealogies&lt;/a&gt;, 1 Chronicles turns to a narrative of the history of the Hebrews in the kingdom era, picking up with Saul’s death—and immediately offers a theological interpretation of the events (2 Samuel and 1 Kings simply report the events and a few people’s responses):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Saul died for his breach of faith. he broke faith with the &lt;span class="smcp"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; in that he did not keep the command of the &lt;span class="smcp"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, and also consulted a medium, seeking guidance. He did not seek guidance from the &lt;span class="smcp"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;. Therefore the &lt;span class="smcp"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; put him to death and turned the kingdom over to David the son of Jesse. (1 Chronicles 10:13–14, ESV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No ambiguity, no reason to misunderstand what happened. Kings made it clear by literary structure. The Chronicles just come out and say it: Yahweh took the kingdom away from Saul because he was unfaithful to him, and he gave it to a man who—whatever his faults, and they were indeed many—would follow Yahweh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Psalm 11, David evinces the very trust in Yahweh Saul lacked. He proclaims his confidence that Yahweh will save him. To the warning that “the wicked bend the bow; / they have fitted their arrow to the string / to shoot in the dark at the upright in heart” (Psalm 11:2, ESV), David has a simple reply: “The &lt;span class="smcp"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; is in his holy temple; / the &lt;span class="smcp"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;’s throne is in heaven; his eyes see, his eyelids test the children of man” (Psalm 11:4, ESV). David’s confidence was not in his own strength. His hope was not in being free and clear of anyone who would oppose him, but in the one whose throne is in heaven. Saul spent his days troubled and afraid because he was never secure in Yahweh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proverbs 11:28 (ESV) comments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoever trusts in his riches will fall,&lt;br /&gt;
    but the righteous will flourish like a green leaf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole chapter resounds with the contrast between trust in riches or power or mortal plans and righteousness. Righteousness, it seems, is in trusting and obeying Yahweh. There is no righteousness that trusts in one’s own strength. There is only the righteousness “which comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God that depends on faith” (Philippians 3:9, ESV). I am reminded tonight not to trust in my own abilities, nor in the provision God has given us,&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; but in God himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id="fn2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What folly to put our trust in the material things we have, when they are not ours save by the generous gift of God!&lt;a href="#fnref2"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

Really, &lt;a href="http://christianaudio.com/free"&gt;for free&lt;/a&gt;. You give them an email address, you get the whole Bible, read &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; well. I highly recommend that you follow up on this, because it is normally not inexpensive, though even so a good audio Bible is a very good investment. Now, back to the regularly scheduled post.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="/2014/temple-for-god/"&gt;challenging&lt;/a&gt; as it can be to apply 2 Chronicles 1—5 correctly, finding the substance in a passage like 1 Chronicles 1—5 is even harder, I think. The entire sequence is a list of names: fathers, sons, occasional wives and daughters in the mix. Genealogies are one of the most challenging sections in the Bible for Western readers, because they seem enormously dry and pointless. (I saw a non-Christian comment on finding the Bible incredibly boring the other day; I have no doubt that passaages like this one contributed substantially to that assessment.) Truth be told, though I am making a game effort at it, I still find these chapters difficult, too.[^sped- up]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two things I hold onto as I consider these challenging chapters, though. The first is Paul’s affirmation that “All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work” (2 Timothy 3:16—17, ESV). That “all” is important, because Paul included 1 Chronicles 1—5 and Numbers 1 and Zechariah 4, challenging though they are in their different ways. He did not exclude them because they might not make as much sense to a future generation in another part of the world. Indeed, I would go so far as to say that under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, Paul explicitly affirmed the value of these books in part &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; they would be foreign to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too often, we privilege our own cultural views as inherently correct in some way. We assume that because genealogies do not matter &lt;em&gt;to us&lt;/em&gt;, they do not matter &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt;. Few of us, it is true, would be so bold as to say this out loud, but deep down, that is what we really believe. (For what we really believe to be true is what drives our actions.) The presence of these lengthy genealogies in the very word of God stands as a clear rebuke to our cultural snobbery–and to our chronological snobbery, too. These genealogies remind us that we are not the first people in God’s story, and that we will not be the last. We are not the main characters in this narrative: even of those named in these chapters, how many are familiar to us now?&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; How many men and women, faithful followers of God, simply go unnamed in these passages? Likewise, who will know our names a thousand years hence, should the Lord tarry?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This genealogy stands as a rebuke to our self-adulation and our emphasis on our own value. It stands as a record of God’s dealings with people who went long before us, and thus as a testament to the historical character of God’s salvific work. It functions as a reminder that God’s plan involves many a flawed hero, and not a few villains. It points us back to the need for a king who would &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; fit the pattern of all the kings named in this line. It highlights God’s faithfulness to keep his promises to Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, and to David, even in the face of Israel’s and Judah’s rebellious ways. It ultimately points us to God himself, the one constant in all these names and relationships. He oversaw their history, as he oversees ours. We ought to reflect more often on those who have gone before us in the faith, and to thank God for them and for his work in history. We ought to be ever more dedicated to worshiping the God in whose hands history flows like a watercourse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even having read through these chapters a number of times, it had escaped me until tonight that David’s generals, Joab, Asahel, and Abishai, were his nephews–the sons of his sister Zeruiah (see 1 Chronicles 2:16). This detail sheds interesting light on many of their interactions, especially on David’s reticence to remove them from authority even when they were unruly. Yet it had previously been lost on me entirely.&lt;a href="#fnref1"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

I accidentally started &lt;em&gt;Second&lt;/em&gt; Chronicles rather than &lt;em&gt;First&lt;/em&gt;. I’ll go back and start with First Chronicles tomorrow.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first blush, the first five chapters of 1 Chronicles do not seem to be particularly scintillating material on the whole. Solomon’s request for wisdom, and God’s answer, are notable, but otherwise the entire section is taken up by details of the construction of the temple. It is at points like this that read- the-Bible-in-a-year plans tend to get bogged down, and it is because of points like this that most read-the-Bible-in-a-year plans include readings from the New Testament as well as the Old. We struggle–or at least, &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; have historically struggled–to make much of these passages. Why does it matter that there were “four hundred pomegranates for the two latticeworks, two rows of pomegranates for each latticework, to cover the bowls of the capitals that were on top of the pillars”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I read the parallel passage in 1 Kings a little while back, it struck me that what we have there—and thus, also what we have here—is enough information to get a sense of the beauty and majesty of this building. The enormous quantitites of precious metals that went into its construction, the attention paid to such fine details of every single aspect of the building and its adornments, the specially chosen timber brought in from a neighboring land: they all show us that this temple was magnificent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are not a temple-building people, and our monuments tend to be austere and formal. Think of the Lincoln or Washington memorials in Washington, D. C.: they are not exactly &lt;em&gt;lively&lt;/em&gt; places. Though celebratory and laudatory, they seek to impress rather than to delight, focusing on clean, simple lines and shapes with little ornamentation. The Solomonic temple, and before it the tabernacle, were &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; like that. They were full of color and decoration, even as they were built at striking physical scales. They were designed to engage every sense, sight and smell especially. They were &lt;em&gt;beautiful&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So: beautiful the temple may have been. We are still left asking why the beauty of a temple built in ancient Jerusalem almost three millennia ago matters to Christians today. The answer, I think, lies in two passages in the New Testament. First:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So then you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God, built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone, in whom the whole structure, being joined together, grows into a holy temple in the Lord. In him you also are being built together into a dwelling place for God by the Spirit. (Ephesians 2:19-22, ESV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And again:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea was no more. And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, “Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man. He will dwell with them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them as their God. He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he who was seated on the throne said, “Behold, I am making all things new….”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I saw no temple in the city, for its temple is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb. And the city has no need of sun or moon to shine on it, for the glory of God gives it light, and its lamp is the Lamb. (Revelation 20:1—5, 22—23)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you see? As magnificent and beautiful as that old temple was, it has been supplanted. The &lt;em&gt;church&lt;/em&gt; is the temple, a dwelling place for God that is yet more beautiful. People are more stunning than the loveliest stones. And there will come a day when the dwelling place of God is with man, not only in spirit but in physical, at th econsummation of all things. That temple, filled as it was with the awesome presence of God, was but the tiniest taste of &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; age, when God indwells every believer. And this age is but the tiniest taste of &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; age, when the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb come down from heaven and make their dwelling place with man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hallelujah. Our Lord, come!&lt;/p&gt;

Tonight I was reading Psalm 8, and thinking about the aims of reading the Bible. Specifically, my aim is to know God and worship him more as I read Scripture. Thus, my goal is that each time I read through a section I would come away both more aware of who God is and more set in both my will and my affections&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to honor him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I read Psalm 8, I was wondering, “Okay, how does this lead me to worship?” Echoing the psalm is a good start, of course, as it opens and closes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh Yahweh, our Lord,&lt;br /&gt;
    how majestic is your name in all the earth!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the rest of the psalm is a meditation not only on Yahweh’s majesty, but on the people he made. This is an interesting turn, and it caught me off guard as I started thinking more carefully about it. The key, I soon realized, is in the fact that this is a Psalm, not a letter or a sermon or a treatise. David felt free to get at his point sideways, as it were, and as is the fashion of poetry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole poem turns back and forth between the God who made the heavens, who set his glory above them, and the people he made. The contrast is striking, and the more so because of the wonderful turns of phrase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I look at your heavens, the work of your fingers,&lt;br /&gt;
        the moon and the stars, which you have set in place,&lt;br /&gt;
    what is man that you are mindful of him,&lt;br /&gt;
        and the son of man that you care for him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I can sum up the point David is making here. One could say simply, “Humans are small compared to the universe, so it is surprising that God would pay attention to them.” But to do so without further reflection is to miss some of the beauty of what David does in the &lt;em&gt;poetry&lt;/em&gt;, and therefore to miss the force of the passage. It is to miss an opportunity to have my emotions interact with this truth, and not only my mind. We have all felt the awe of staring at a night sky full of lights, a billion miles away and burning brighter than our own sun so that we can see them here across the aeons. We have all felt small against that vastness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if we stop for a moment and feel that here with David, and then are caught by the sudden turn—“what is man?”—we can feel with him the wonder that the God who set his glory above the heavens is the God who gave man dominion over creation. We can feel with him the surprise that God would not only establish his strength before the nations and before those who rebel against him, but that he would do it through babies and infants. We can feel with him the greatness of a God who is not limited by our feeble strength and our mortality, whose majesty goes beyond the tinyness of humanity and yet is somehow the greater for the ways he uses us, little beings that we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How majestic is the name of Yahweh in all the earth, indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

Whereas 1 and 2 Samuel zoomed in on the contrast between Saul and David, 1 and 2 Kings take nearly all their successors at a very high level, often sparing them few more words than necessary to note their parentage, whether they did what was right or what was evil in the eyes of Yahweh, and a reference to other records of their deeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the dominant themes of these books, then, is that doing what is right in Yahweh’s eyes has an enormous reward, while doing what is evil in his eyes eventually brings a great judgment. 2 Kings 17—19 brings this message home, and hard. Centuries of rebellion on Israel’s part culminated in the Assyrian capture of Samaria and the forcible exile of the Jews of Israel from their homeland. The author pauses from his otherwise quick-moving narrative to explain this point in detail for the better part of a chapter. Israel’s fall was not the mere ordinary turn of regional political events it might have seemed. It was, instead, God’s final judgment on a people who had continuously rebelled against him generation after generation, worshiping in a way they &lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt; was abhorrent to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contrast, when the same mighty king with his mighty army came to take Jerusalem, the city stood. Judah had its share of wicked kings, to be sure–but unlike Israel, it also had many kings who “did what was right in the eyes of Yahweh” and in particular it had Hezekiah, who “trusted in Yahweh, the God of Israel, so that there was none like him among all the kings of Judah after him, nor among those who were before him” (18:5).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The armies of the greatest power in the region–unstoppable Assyria–surrounded the capital city en masse. Their leaders boasted in their victories, tried to bully Hezekiah and the people into surrendering without a fight, and insulted the name of Yahweh. Attacking the people of God is always a bad idea; attacking him directly is an even &lt;em&gt;worse&lt;/em&gt; idea. The Scriptures are a long record of the lengths to which God will go to defend his name: he will quite literally die to defend the glorious reality that he is most righteous and most powerful being there is, most worthy of worship. When Sennacherib boasted, “Who among all the gods of the lands have delivered their lands out of my hand, that Yahweh should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?” (18:35), he missed something. Hezekiah points it out in his prayer: “[They] were not gods, but the work of men’s hands, wood and stone. Therefore they were destroyed. So now, O Yahweh our God, save us, please, from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you, O Yahweh, are God alone” (19:18b—29).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God has &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; been about the business of making his name known to the ends of the earth. Not because he is a braggart, but because he is the end for which all things exist–the end for which &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; exist. In setting ourselves against that, we are setting ourselves against reality. We are trying to fly by pushing away from the ground with the hairs on our head–and for some reason, gravity comes out victorious. So when God brings judgment on blasphemers, that is a &lt;em&gt;mercy&lt;/em&gt; to the nations who have a chance to repent and kneel before the king of all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is amazing to me is just how profoundly longsuffering God is. Were I so often insulted, ignored, and injuriously assaulted in character, I would not wait hundreds of years, sending prophet after prophet to give people opportunity after opportunity to respond. I sometimes have a hard time restraining my impatience for a few minutes with my wife or my child. And yet the God who ultimately struck down 185,000 Assyrians waited generation upon generation to bring his judgment on Israel–and he likewise gave the Assyrians the opportunity to repent (c.f. Jonah). This God is shockingly merciful, even as he brings judgment.&lt;/p&gt;

First a summary and then a few thoughts on each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verses 1–5:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Being security for your neighbor—still less for a stranger—is a bad idea.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This first point is perhaps the least obviously applicable to me today. I don’t make a habit of pledging money or possessions for a friend’s (still less a stranger’s) poor money decisions. I might &lt;em&gt;give&lt;/em&gt; a friend (or even a stranger) money, but I can’t imagine putting myself in the position of guaranteeing a loan for someone else. That just seems like a terrible idea. Of course, that’s the point of these verses: it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a terrible idea. The counsel here is to get out of that kind of situation as fast as possible (and, by implication, to avoid getting into such a situation in the first place).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verses 6–11:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Laziness will prove ruinous. Industriousness will produce good results.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have seen this proven true time and again in the lives of those around me. As a general rule, people who work hard do well for themselves, and people who are lazy do very poorly for themselves. As a rule, I say, because there are times when this is not true—there really are times when systemic injustices undermine even people’s best efforts. This proverb is a proverb, not an iron-clad guarantee, and we would all do well to remember as much. That said: we would &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; do well to remember as much: if the political conservative’s typical response is to simply point to this verse as a promise (which it is not), the political liberal’s typical response is to act as though this verse has no bearing whatsoever. Sometimes, poverty has complex, structural, societal roots—but sometimes, people are just lazy. God calls us &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to be lazy; work is a good thing that was instituted before the Fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verses 12–15:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;The ultimate fate of a wicked person is calamity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is nothing terribly complicated here. There is, however, a great deal of hope here for those of us who have watched wicked people go around behaving wickedly and seemingly coming off no worse for wear every time. There will come a day of recompense for every wicked deed. Lord willing, for some of those people, that day came when Christ came, and they will join us in the company of saints as they abandon their wickedness and turn to God. But for those who don’t, justice will come, and it will come swiftly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verses 16–19:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;There are some things God truly hates.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is almost &lt;em&gt;passe&lt;/em&gt; to note how distasteful this idea is in our culture today, but the words on the page could not be clearer. There are things that Yahweh hates, things that are an abomination to him. He hates pride. He abominates deceit. He hates the shedding of innocent blood. He abominates the plotting of wickedness. He hates the doing of evil. He abominates false witness to be borne. He hates dissension between brothers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But more than this: he hates those who &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; these things. This is dreadful —apart from the grace he shows us in Christ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verses 20–35:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Adultery is folly. Wisdom runs the other way.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/2014/01/folly-of-sin"&gt;Once again&lt;/a&gt;, the proverbs hammer home the folly of adultery. It is not only that it does not give what it promises and brings spiritual ruin. It is that it also produces, at a purely practical level, destruction. A spouse’s jealousy is (rightly) a fearful thing. Who in his right mind would sleep with another man’s wife, knowing what the response would be? What woman would sleep with another woman’s husband, knowing how her own rage would be? The implications just for one’s own health—still less any other part of one’s life—ought to be enough to warn us away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Proverbs remind me again and again that God cares about my life at every level. He is not distant or unengaged with these details; he cares about every aspect of human flourishing, and takes pains to make clear to us what that flourishing looks like—and what it doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chris Krycho</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jan 2014 20:30:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:www.chriskrycho.com,2014-01-06:2014/five-things-proverbs-six.html</guid><category>devotions</category></item><item><title>The Folly of Sin</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/folly-of-sin.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Adultery. It has torn countless families and destroyed innumerable ministries over the years. Over and over again, the refrain is the same: “I never thought it would happen to me!” and “I never meant for it to go this far!”&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Given the evidence of the years, though, no one should ever cavalierly say, “I’ll never do that.” Say it, yes. But back it up by making concrete choices every day not to break vows to your spouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proverbs 5 couldn’t be clearer: adultery &lt;em&gt;looks&lt;/em&gt; good from the outside and feels good at the outset:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the lips of a forbidden woman drip honey,&lt;br /&gt;
    and her speech is smoother than oil,&lt;br /&gt;
but in the end she is bitter as wormwood,&lt;br /&gt;
    sharp as a two-edged sword.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one commits adultery because it looks so dreadful. People commit this sin— like every other—because it looks good. The trick, of course, is that it is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;. The Proverb highlights the contradiction of sin powerfully: sin looks sweet, but proves bitter. It seems smooth, but only proves smoothly destructive as it slices away at everything you value. Sin always produces the opposite of what it promises. Adultery promises intimacy, but adultery &lt;em&gt;destroys&lt;/em&gt; intimacy. Drugs promise liberated minds; instead they produce addiction. Covetousness promises satisfaction; instead it produces only an ever-gnawing emptiness. Sin is like a sweet-tasting infection that rots us from the inside out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it is more than that. Sin is not bad only because it proves so ruinous to us —though certainly it is bad for that reason. Sin is bad because it is high treason, because it is at its core a rejection of the good, the true, the beautiful in that it is a rejection of God in the exaltation of self. Sin is ruinous to us in part because it is the undoing of everything of what we are: beings made to worship the Triune God, instead kneeling to our own reflection in the mirror instead of the one we were meant to reflect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But God is a righteous judge. He is holy. He does not tolerate sin. Psalm 5 puts it in sharp relief:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For you are not a God who delights in wickedness;&lt;br /&gt;
    evil may not dwell with you.&lt;br /&gt;
The boastful shall not stand before your eyes;&lt;br /&gt;
    you hate all evildoers.&lt;br /&gt;
You destroy those who speak lies;&lt;br /&gt;
    Yahweh abhors the bloodthirsty and deceitful man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God detests sin.&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Not just the hot-button sin issues of our day (though those are not excluded), but our pettiness and jealousy, our deceptions great and small, our boasting and pride. We are &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; evildoers. And yet, wonder of wonders, we live still. Though God who made us and at whom we have all shaken our fists in rebellion would be perfectly within his rights to end us without a thought; he does not. He shows mercy. He forbears long. He waits to bring judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He provides a way of escape. We, like David, can enter his house “through the abundance of [his] steadfast love.” That steadfast love, that covenant love, that almight love, has reached down and partaken of frail humanity and death and even of divine wrath, so that God might be glorified in his holiness. We are saved not because God is sentimental or sappy, but because he is righteous, and has already paid the price for our sins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hallelujah.&lt;/p&gt;

They perform miracles that show up the limitations of other so-called deities, part the Jordan, make clean what was impure, give miraculous children, raise the dead, multiply food for a meal for the hungry.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; These men were prophets like Moses, but Israel knew that they were not &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; prophet like Moses that the first savior of Israel had promised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading through these books, it is interesting that Israel was eagerly awaiting another prophet like Elijah when Jesus came. Indeed, it is interesting that a later prophet would speak of Elijah coming again. Reading through this material —which was originally all a single book covering all of 1 Samuel through 2 Kings—one would not necessarily be inclined to call Elijah the greater of the pair. Indeed, Elisha both asked for and apparently received a double portion of the miraculous gift that Yahweh had given to Elijah. The text records far more miracles performed by Elisha than by Elijah. (Indeed, most of that list above belongs to Elisha and not to Elijah.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, though, there was something special about Elijah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it was his passion for the name of Yahweh, and I think the text makes this abundantly clear. It is not that Elisha was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; passionate for the glory of Yahweh; it is that this is the main (and nearly the only) thing in view in Elijah’s ministry. Elijah’s responsibility was to point the people to repentance for their sins and to show up false religion for what it was. This he did. He stood for the name of Yahweh under the threat of death and all alone. Other faithful Yahweh-worshippers though there were in Israel at the time, it was Elijah alone on the mountain confronting the four hundred priests of Baal, and he alone who saw the mighty hand of Yahweh raised in triumph against Baalism. He, like John the Baptizer, was the lone voice in the wilderness, calling the people of Israel back to God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elisha’s role was different: he was the man of miracles and the fierce judge. He did the greatest miracles recorded in the Bible prior to the coming of the Messiah; only in Jesus himself was there a greater provider, healer, or resurrector. He pointed to the greatness of Yahweh through these miracles; unlike Elijah, he did so in a time when many others worshipped Yahweh. He stood on Elijah’s shoulders, as it were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have often pondered over the last year or so that often it is the case that younger leaders can seem (and perhaps are) more effective than their elders— but that even when this is so, there is a foundation present &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; of the elders that is too easily overlooked. Many young men’s pastoral ministries are successful not only because of their own faithfulness, but because of the work of the pastors who preceded them. Many young men can be more doctrinally sound than or more effective preachers than their predecessors &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; of their predecessors. Elisha did his miracles in a land that had already seen Baalism humbled under fire from Yahweh. I do my writing, ministry (such as it is), and even thinking in the context set for me by faithful Christians who have gone before, women and men who have diligently sought Christ and laid a foundation on which I might build.&lt;/p&gt;

But this one, I find, yields the most fruit. The Bible is not just a book of moral teachings, nor a mere practical guide for our lives. It is the revelation of the living God to his people.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what do we do when we get to, say, Proverbs? At first blush, the question seems a good deal less tractable here than in many other places. However hairy, most narratives &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; show us the character of God. Propositional content, whether in letters or sermons or parables or prophecies, likewise tends to make clear, succinct statements about the person and nature of God. The Proverbs, though? Well, sometimes they do, and sometimes they say things like, “Do not contend with a man for no reason, when he has done you no harm.” That’s helpful, to be sure, but when you first read it, it’s not obvious how that gets us back to God. We could try to hammer the Proverbs into some framework for understanding God, try to reduce their presence in the canon to a role in some theme or another.&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; In the end, though, any such reductive effort is going to run aground on the shoals of misunderstanding—quite the opposite of the intent of the author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Proverbs often show us God’s character sideways. If we believe that the counsel offered by the Proverbs really is wise—that the glowing promises here in Proverbs 3 of blessing, gain, and profit from wisdom are true, that there really is nothing better than to have understanding—then we believe that they are insights into reality. And reality was made &lt;em&gt;by God&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yahweh by wisdom founded the earth;&lt;br /&gt;
    by understanding he established the heavens;&lt;br /&gt;
by his knowledge the deeps broke open,&lt;br /&gt;
    and the clouds drop down the dew. (Proverbs 3:19–20)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we then start asking good questions of the text we find very quickly that we do have a path back to the person and nature of God. For example: &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; should we not contend with a man when he has done us no harm? Well, we ought not do so because it will certainly stir up trouble, and we know God does not delight in strife. Moreover, picking a fight with someone without cause is unjust, and this same author has told us that wisdom comports with justice and righteousness, and that &lt;em&gt;God&lt;/em&gt; is just.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking a further step back, we can ask why this proverb is included in the inspired Scriptures. Then we see even more: God cares about the way people interact with one another. He values human flourishing, and so has provided enormous guidance for us in the form of hundreds upon hundreds of practical insights into the way the world is. He delights in people so greatly that he crosses the boundary between transcendence and immanence to give us his very words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out there is an awful lot to learn about God in the Proverbs—even the ones that do no mention him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;That final phrase, “to his people,” is an important one for all hermeneutics; reading the Scriptures with faith makes a difference. &lt;a href="http://mereorthodoxy.com/"&gt;Matthew Lee Anderson&lt;/a&gt; makes this point helpfully and at some length in his excellent &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/End-Our-Exploring-Questioning-Confidence-ebook/dp/B00BUP1BQQ/?tag=krycho-20"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The End of Our Exploring&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a href="#fnref1"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is right here that many Biblical theologies—that’s a specific discipline in theology, though admittedly poorly named—go amiss.&lt;a href="#fnref2"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

The material in 1 Kings covered a series of kings whose courses were largely &lt;em&gt;away&lt;/em&gt; from worshipping Yahweh and toward worshipping other gods. With only one exception, in fact, every single king listed in these five chapters rejected the God of Israel in favor of the gods of the nations which the Hebrews had driven out of Canaan. That exception, Asa, stands in sharp contrast to the litany of rebellious kings who preceded and followed him as being a man who followed God with his whole heart. Others, it seems, included Yahweh in their list of gods to worship, but never reverenced him as supreme and only. This list of wicked kings of both Israel and Judah climaxes with the appearance of Elijah, the righteous prophet who confronts the &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; wicked king in the list, and who ultimately demonstrates Yahweh’s superiority over the other gods the Hebrews worshipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proverbs 2 continues Solomon’s exhortation to seek wisdom wholeheartedly, and his corresponding encouragement that Yahweh gives wisdom to those who seek it. But Solomon did not stop with the idea that knowledge and understanding are good —though this he certainly affirms. Rather, he continued on to emphasize that God’s knowledge and discernment go hand in hand with his integrity and justice. Those who seek this wisdom walk in righteousness and justice and equity. A person of wisdom is kept safe from both evildoers and from doing evil him- or herself. That Solomon’s own line, beginning with his own son and continuing on down through every king but Asa in these chapters in 1 Kings, went so far astray indicates how little these words were heeded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The picture painted by Psalm 2 stands in impossibly sharp contrast to these depraved kings. The Anointed One of the psalm is a messianic figure: those who take refuge in him find shelter, but those who rebel against him are broken under his rule. There is a king in view here who laughs at the rebellion of the rulers of every nation (Israel included), who scorns the folly of plotting against the Most High God. The king that Yahweh calls his Son will receive those same nations as his inheritance. He will be the king above all other kings. He will be both wrathful against rebellion and merciful to those who “take refuge in him” (v. 11–12).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we have set before us the history of wicked men rebelling against the very God who gave them their thrones, and a call to that same line of the kings to humbly seek wisdom from that God, and a poetic picture of the true king against whom any rebellion is folly. And running through all of these are both the wrath of God against the folly and sin of those rebelling against him, and his mercy. Yahweh saves his people from following other gods in that magnificent confrontation on the mountain, Elijah on one side and the priests of Baal on the other. He is the source of wisdom, and the one who keeps his people from walking in folly or wickedness. And he is the righteous king who gives his people peace and security. Not because he does not do justice or cares little about sin, but precisely &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; he does justice and cares about sin. That Anointed One, that Son of the Most High, is Jesus Christ, who died in order that everything would be put under his feet. Every wicked king in 1 Kings points to the need for Jesus. He is the fulfillment of the wisdom promised in Proverbs 2. He is the Anointed One, the Son of Yahweh, who reigns the nations in righteousness. Hallelujah.&lt;/p&gt;

I have also found that I am often better able to remain consistent in my study of Scripture if I am writing regularly about it. That could be in a journal, or on a blog, or just about anywhere. In 2014, I am going to experiment with posting this writing on my blog —something I have done &lt;a href="http://2012-2013.chriskrycho.com/theology/topics/devotions/index.html"&gt;before&lt;/a&gt; to good effect for myself, and which a number of acquaintances seemed to like. After talking it through with my wonderful wife, I have set myself a limit of half an hour &lt;em&gt;total&lt;/em&gt; devoted to writing these posts. Hopefully it will prove profitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it seems like 1 Kings 9–13 is a funny place to start this sort of thing, that’s because it is. But 1 Kings is where I am, and thus it is the place from which I will continue—I do not see a good reason to start over at the beginning &lt;em&gt;again&lt;/em&gt; just a few months after having done so before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of points stuck out at me as I worked through this passage. First, and most important, is one of the recurring themes of the whole book: the question of obedience to Yahweh,&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the consequences of rejecting him. From the promise God offers Solomon in chapter 9 through the death of a prophet in chapter 13, the issue is clear. Obedience to God brings everlasting favor, and disobedience brings death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not exactly a new theme for the Bible as a whole: it shows up all the way back in Genesis 3. Nor does it stop here (nor even under the New Covenant with Christ): submission to God is characteristic of all who believe. Why? Not because God is some cruel dictator, but because he is both omniscient and omnibenevolent. He knows what is best for us. Defying his ways is like defying gravity: it might make for a &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlMBcTGJ4YM&amp;amp;name=DefyingGravity"&gt;catchy tune&lt;/a&gt;, but the net result is always crashing hard to the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So: Yahweh promised Solomon great things if he would simply follow him alone and not worship other gods. Solomon did exactly the opposite of what God had commanded the kings of Israel, though: he married multiple foreign women who themselves worshiped other gods,&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and ultimately he built altars to and sacrificed to those other gods himself. We see the same thing in Jeroboam’s life: God made him promises of really marvelous import, if he would simply walk with Yahweh. Instead, as soon as he became king he led the people &lt;em&gt;away&lt;/em&gt; from Yahweh, reasoning that Yahweh-worship was a threat to his own power, even though it was a prophet of Yahweh who had first told him all that would happen and that it was Yahweh who would do it. A righteous prophet ends up dead because he disobeyed God’s clear instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short: God means business, and we ought to pay attention when he commands us in a certain area. Again, not because he is a tyrant, but because he loves us and he is righteous. When we defy him, we are simultaneously wronging ourselves and committing cosmic treason. It’s a bad move, and he rightly responds in judgment. That, in turn, though, takes me back to his &lt;em&gt;decisive&lt;/em&gt; act of judgment: the one the Godhead executed on itself, in the sacrificial, atoning death of Christ on my behalf. My motivation for obedience, then, is not only fear, but joyful gratitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a good start to the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know it is a bit unusual to spell out the name of God used in the Old Testament like this, but it is my preference. I think it makes many passages much clearer to read Yahweh instead of &lt;span style="font-variant: small-
caps"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, and it’s simply what’s there in the original (even if the Jews historically have chosen not to say it—there’s something interesting here, but I shall pass over it today).&lt;a href="#fnref1"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that the reason for the prohibition on marrying foreigners was always religious, not ethnic. Solomon’s own lineage (and thus, Jesus’ too) includes several foreign women—each of whom worshiped Yahweh.&lt;a href="#fnref2"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
