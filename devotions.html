<p>The books of Chronicles serve as something of a parallel and supplementary account to the books of 1 and 2 Samuel and 1 and 2 Kings.<sup id="fnref:kings"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:kings" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> There are a few significant differences between the books, though. First, Samuel and Kings take considerable time to trace out Saul&#8217;s history and then divided their attention fairly evenly between Judah and Israel, with a slight emphasis on Israel because of Elijah and Elisha&#8217;s ministries there. The Chronicles skip almost entirely over Saul and focus predominantly on the Davidic line in&nbsp;Judah.</p>
<p>Second, Samuel and Kings generally let events speak for themselves, with little commentary. Yahweh is always in control, but the author rarely provides explicit theological interpretation of the events recorded. The Chronicles, rather strikingly, <em>often</em> make straightforward claims about divine action and provide moral commentary on the events they record. After its long list of <a href="/theology/grappling-with-genealogies.html">genealogies</a>, 1 Chronicles turns to a narrative of the history of the Hebrews in the kingdom era, picking up with Saul&#8217;s death&#8211;and immediately offers a theological interpretation of the events (2 Samuel and 1 Kings simply report the events and a few people&#8217;s&nbsp;responses):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So Saul died for his breach of faith. he broke faith with the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> in that he did not keep the command of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, and also consulted a medium, seeking guidance. He did not seek guidance from the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>. Therefore the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> put him to death and turned the kingdom over to David the son of Jesse. (1 Chronicles 10:13&#8212;14,&nbsp;<span class="caps">ESV</span>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No ambiguity, no reason to misunderstand what happened. Kings made it clear by literary structure. The Chronicles just come out and say it: Yahweh took the kingdom away from Saul because he was unfaithful to him, and he gave it to a man who&#8211;whatever his faults, and they were indeed many&#8211;would follow&nbsp;Yahweh.</p>
<hr />
<p>In Psalm 11, David evinces the very trust in Yahweh Saul lacked. He proclaims his confidence that Yahweh will save him. To the warning that &#8220;the wicked bend the bow; / they have fitted their arrow to the string / to shoot in the dark at the upright in heart&#8221; (Psalm 11:2, <span class="caps">ESV</span>), David has a simple reply: &#8220;The <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> is in his holy temple; / the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>&#8216;s throne is in heaven; his eyes see, his eyelids test the children of man&#8221; (Psalm 11:4, <span class="caps">ESV</span>). David&#8217;s confidence was not in his own strength. His hope was not in being free and clear of anyone who would oppose him, but in the one whose throne is in heaven. Saul spent his days troubled and afraid because he was never secure in&nbsp;Yahweh.</p>
<hr />
<p>Proverbs 11:28 (<span class="caps">ESV</span>)&nbsp;comments:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whoever trusts in his riches will fall,<br />
but the righteous will flourish like a green&nbsp;leaf.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The whole chapter resounds with the contrast between trust in riches or power or mortal plans and righteousness. Righteousness, it seems, is in trusting and obeying Yahweh. There is no righteousness that trusts in one&#8217;s own strength. There is only the righteousness &#8220;which comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God that depends on faith&#8221; (Philippians 3:9, <span class="caps">ESV</span>). I am reminded tonight not to trust in my own abilities, nor in the provision God has given us,<sup id="fnref:provision"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:provision" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> but in God&nbsp;himself.</p>
