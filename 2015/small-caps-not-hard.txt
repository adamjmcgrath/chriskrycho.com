In addition to the various other issues I tackled in the [review] I published at Mere O today, there was one other secondary but to my mind non-trivial issue with Barrs' _Echoes of Eden_. I left it aside because it certainly wasn't Barrs' fault, and would have seemed absurdly nitpicky to my audience there. But it bears comment nonetheless.

The small caps! The divine name appeared in a number of places throughout the books, as <span class="smcp">Lord</span> (just as it does in the Bible). Unfortunately, Crossway chose to use a Palatino variant without real [small capitals]. Yes, I know: it's a little detail, and in the grand scheme of things it isn't *that* important. But it's the little details like that which add up to the difference between a so-so printing of a book and a truly delightful printing of a book. They make a big difference in the experience of reading the book (albeit usually a subconscious one, unless like me you are a typography nerd). I think that a book on the arts, of all books, should have really delightful typesetting. (Honestly, *all* books should have good typesetting, but the lack is even less excusable when the book is about beauty!)

Rant over. But please, Crossway and everyone else printing the divine name: use real small capitals. And in general, please work to make your typography *excellent*, not just passable.
