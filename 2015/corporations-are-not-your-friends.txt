Tip for conservative Christians (and everyone else for that matter): embracing
free market economics doesn't mean you need to become a [shill for
mega-corporations]. Amazon is not your friend, or pro-family, or a charity; it's
a company in pursuit of ever-greater market dominance.

In and of itself, that doesn't make Amazon[^1] evil (though [other things]
might)---but don't mistake its motives.
