Here’s someone else making one of the same points I made last week about the indie---but much more succinctly!

 >Oh man, I wrote a blog post only to find out later that <a href="https://twitter.com/chriskrycho">\@chriskrycho</a> has written a much better version of it... <a href="https://t.co/BDpi8ifPnH">https://t.co/BDpi8ifPnH</a></p>&mdash; Mustapha Hamoui (\@Beirutspring) <a href="https://twitter.com/Beirutspring/status/818078957941780481">January 8, 2017</a>

My only real disagreement with [\@Beirutspring] there is that I think (and hope) there’s room for centralized services *and* the open web.
