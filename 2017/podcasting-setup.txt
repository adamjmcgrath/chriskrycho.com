## Introduction

I often get asked for recommendations about podcast recording: equipment, editing tools, approach, etc. So, at the request of several friends, I've put this post together as a one-stop shop to cover it *all*. This isn't coming from a professional podcaster---despite the sheer number of podcasts I produce, I'm still an amateur in terms of the role this plays in my life and the income I get from it---but I think it's actually all the more valuable for that reason. After all, *most* podcasters are amateurs!

## Editing

After _having a plan_, the process of editing is the one I think many podcasters overlook and which I most wish they didn't. The difference between a well-editors podcast and an unedited, little-edited, or badly-edited podcast is frequently the difference between my continuing to listen even past the first five minutes and my just giving up on a show entirely. There are only a couple shows I listen to which are poorly edited, and I listen for the interviewees, but they frustrate me constantly.

Don't be like those shows. Edit your podcast, and edit it well. What that means will be different for every show, but it's a necessity no matter what you're doing.
