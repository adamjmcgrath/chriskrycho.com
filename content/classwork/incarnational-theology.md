# I. The Centrality and Uniqueness of the Incarnation

The Incarnation of the Son of God is the grounds of all Christian hope. It is the "central miracle asserted by Christians."[^I-1a] Without the Incarnation, there would be no redemption. Not only would the other aspects of redemption (Christ's life, teaching, death on the cross, resurrection, and ascension) not be possible, but parts of the restoration of humanity hinge on the Incarnation itself. In addition to its centrality, the Incarnation was a unique event in history, with unique theological significance. At no other time has God manifested himself as a human being, and insofar as he now indwells all believers in the Spirit it is as a result of the and furthering of the way divinity and humanity were (re)united in the person of Jesus Christ.

Unfortunately, both the centrality and uniqueness of the Incarnation have sometimes been lost, both in the Western church broadly drawn and in evangelicalism in particular. A healthy church depends on a healthy Christology, for it is only in Christ and by Christ's Spirit that the church exists. There can be no healthy Christology without a robust doctrine of the Incarnation, for it is in the Incarnation that Jesus the Messiah must be understood: as fully God and man in a single person. When this is lost (or even minimized), the other elements of Christian salvation eventually become confused.

## A. Biblical Affirmations

Each of the Gospels opens in such a way as to indicate the unique nature of Jesus Christ. Matthew begins with a genealogy that situate him in the story of Israel, then shows in narrative that he was no ordinary man (Matt. 1--2, esp. 1:1, 1:23). Mark, ever brief, contents himself with the astounding words, "Jesus Christ, the Son of God" (Mark 1:1).[^I-A-2a] Luke inverts Matthew's order and goes further with his genealogy, situating Jesus not only in Israel's story but in humanity's, tracing his lineage to Adam and reminding his audience that Adam, too, was a son of God (Luke 1:26--28, 2:8--38, 3:23--38). John reaches out to Greek philosophy and turns it on its head, proclaiming the coming of the uncreated *logos* into creation (John 1:1--18). The sum effect of the gospel-tellers is to emphasize that in Jesus Christ, something profoundly unique had happened.

Perhaps nowhere is the essential character and uniqueness of the Incarnation more evident than in Hebrews. The anonymous letter emphasizes the uniqueness of Jesus' incarnation and ministry (Heb. 1:1--2). It also repeatedly argues for essentiality of the Incarnation for his roles as priest (2:17--18, 4:15, 5:5--10, 7:26--8:2), destroyer of death (2:14--15), and propitiatory sacrifice (2:9, 7:27, 9:11--28, 10:12--14, 10:19--22). This breadth of importance to the Incarnation is a consistent theme throughout the New Testament: it is not only that Jesus died to save people from their sins, but that he became human and lived to that end and more besides.

A few samples will highlight the breadth of the impact of the Incarnation, though many more could be offered to illustrate the point. Zechariah's prophecy (Luke 1:76--79) includes salvation from sin and also light coming into the world, death's power coming to an end, and peace reigning in the cosmos. Likewise, the apostle John's gospel, the apostle couples the Incarnation to the doctrine of adoption. Paul exults in the Incarnation as the grounds of the reconciliation of all things, humanity included (Col 1:19--20). He also explicitly couples the Messiah's full humanity to humans being filled in him in turn (Col. 2:9--10)---a theme that Peter also picks up, noting that the saints become "partakers of the divine nature" (2 Peter 1:4).

In short, the New Testament affirms that the Incarnation was an essential element in the salvation of humanity---not only as a prerequisite for other parts of Christ's work, but in and of itself. The Incarnation is the means by which human nature is brought once again into fellowship with the Godhead. Christ is the eschatological firstfruits of this restoration. As he is, so will all the saints be in glory: restored to unbroken fellowship between humanity and humanity's Creator.

## B. The Theology of the Church

The importance of the Incarnation has been affirmed by the church throughout her history. The Church Fathers fleshed out the orthodox doctrine of the Incarnation over the first four centuries of the history of the church, with various controversies erupting every century.[^I-B-1a] This work culminated in the lasting affirmations and denials of the Chalcedonian formula.[^I-B-1b] In fact, nearly every theological controversy in the early church was a Christological controversy, and every such controversy hinged on issues pertaining to the nature of the Incarnation. In the course of the first five centuries of the faith, then, the church worked through the questions raised by the Incarnation and formulated creeds and definitions that rigorously defended the Bible's definition of the Incarnation. The Fathers recognized that the details of God's becoming man were essential if the faith were to be preserved: that Jesus had to be a single person in whom "all the fullness of deity dwells bodily" (Col. 2:9) and who "likewise partook of [flesh and blood]" (Heb. 2:14). Should either his full divinity or his full humanity be lost, the grounds of human salvation would be lost with it.

Modern theologians have rightly carried forward this Incarnational thought. Of particular note is the way in which patristic thought on Christ and theology have experienced resurgence as resources for Christian thought at intervals since the Reformation. Athanasius' incarnational Christology, with its emphasis on the transformational effect of the Incarnation itself on humanity's state,[^I-B-2a] has found new advocates in the late twentieth century. If such advocates have sometimes pressed this recovery in unhelpful directions (see below), they have also argued forcefully and helpfully for a view of the Incarnation that grasps what God's becoming man has *already* accomplished---the first step of the eschatological transformation of humanity. "The crucified Christ stands in solidarity with humanity, not merely as ane xample of confrontation with the world to be imitated by us *but as the reality of new humanity in which we may and must participate*."[^I-B-2b] Jesus' humanity is an essential ingredient in human salvation and in the sanctified life of the believer in the present---the Spirit mediating Christ's humanity mediated to the believer's---as well as his glorified reality in the future.

# II. The Importance of Recognizing Its Uniqueness In Life and Ministry

Given the importance of the Incarnation established above, it is clear that the church must maintain the doctrine---not only affirming it in principle, but cherishing it in practice. Moreover, the doctrine must be protected. Too often, it is lost through neglect or abuse. A healthy church will take care to protect against such loss, as well as against misappropriations of the language of incarnation that distract from the work of the Son, however well intentioned.

## A. Absence

The first and most common failure of the church with regard to its theology of the Incarnation has been its absence, whether by doctrinal negation or by simple unobservance. In the first case, a denial of the doctrine has been commonplace in church history generally: as noted above, many of the early Christological heresies were matters relating to the Incarnation, and variations on adoptionism especially continue to arise in heretical offshoots. In particular, both Mormons and the Jehovah's Witnesses affirm adoptionist views. In the Reformation era, the Anabaptist movement included many who affirmed a "heavenly flesh" view in which . All such heretical views, ancient and modern alike, leave the person embracing them without ultimate salvific hope. As Gregory Nazianzen commented during the Arian controversy, "For that which He has not assumed he has not healed; but that which is united to His Godhead is also saved. If only half Adam fell, then that which Christ assumes and saves may be half also; but if the whole of his nature fell, it must be united to the whole nature of Him that was begotten, and so be saved as a whole."[^II-A-1a]

On a different line, the anti-supernatural bent of many liberal theologies in the last several centuries has similarly resulted in a rejection of the doctrine of the Incarnation. For many liberals theologians, Jesus was representative of the God-consciousness in us all at its best and adopted by God as a special figure in human history accordingly.[^II-A-2a] Any such outright rejection clearly results in the loss of all that the doctrine entails---not least any hope of real salvation. If Jesus was merely a man who was particularly helpful or holy, he could not redeem other humans. He could at best set others a good example. His death and his resurrection[^II-A-2b] can have symbolic power only. They do not save. They inspire or impress at best, and intimidate with their inimitability at worst.

Though few (if any) conservative scholars would deny the importance of the Incarnation, it is the unfortunate reality that the doctrine receives receives little attention among evangelicals. The crucicentric bent of the evangelical movement has often led to other aspects of the Son's work being overlooked, so that the Incarnation, Resurrection, and Ascension of Christ are all often treated as mere accessories to or prerequisites for his death.[^II-A-3a] Even when unintentional, this kind of failure by way of absence produces serious deficits in the people of God's understanding of God's work in Christ as well as his future work in themselves. Much of the antiphysical tendency latent in evangelical eschatology, and its correspondingly unphysical view of the age to come, may be laid at the feet of a diminished theology of the Incarnation. This can only lead to a dimming of future hope---who really wants to be a disembodied spirit somehow strumming a harp forever?---which in turn produces real challenges in the life and faith of believers who do not have the future hope to which Scripture actually points.

[^II-A-2b]: The resurrection is of course customarily denied in such theologies as well.

## B. "Incarnational Theology": A Two-Fold Error

The second major way in which we may falter in our incarnational theology is by misapplying it. It has become increasingly common to speak of "incarnational theology" as a way of describing the Christian mission to the world: Christians ought to "incarnate" Christ to the world as Christ "incarnated" the Godhead to humanity.[^II-B-1a] There is much to appreciate in this sentiment. It represents an appropriate recognition that humans are God's image-bearers. It pays heed to the New Testament's assertion that Christians are the body of and ambassadors for Christ. It takes seriously Paul's shocking language of "filling up what is lacking in Christ's afflictions" (Col. 1:24). It rightly points to the synthesis of missionary activity and social activism that represents the best of evangelicalism.[^II-B-1b] Yet for all that, applying the language of incarnation to believers is a serious mistake, in two ways.

[^II-B-1a]: Cf. David L. Darbyshire, "Incarnational Evangelism: An Intentional Approach to Sharing the Good News in a Boundary Environment" (DMin diss., Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary, 1989), 46--50; Kenneth A. Barnes, "'And the Word Became Flesh': The Incarnation: A Model For Evangelism" (DMin diss., Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary, 1990), 32--43, 48, 50, 57.

[^II-B-1b]: Cf. William E. Pannell, "Evangelism: Solidarity and Reconciliation," in Speidell, 203.

First, this kind of "incarnational" language is a misapplication of the New Testament "body" metaphor for the church, contra the proponents of "incarnational theology", and notwithstanding Scripture's many calls to imitate Christ.[^II-B-2a] The Scriptures nowhere justify the idea that ordinary men and women can (or should) mediate the presence of God to people. The strongest argument for such a view is in the notion that the church is the body of Christ, but Paul uniformly used the language to teach the unity of the people of God---never evangelism. The authors of the New Testament chose other images for proclaiming Christ instead: fishermen (Matt. 4:19), servants working in the absence of their master (Matt. 24:45--51), or ambassadors and representatives (2 Cor. 5:20)---to name just a few. At no point does the Bible use the metaphor of the body to describe Christian witness to the world.

[^II-B-2a]: Barnes (36--38) rightly notes that imitation is an essential element in the Christian life, but makes numerous hermeneutical missteps in his attempt to extend those texts to justify an "incarnational" theology.

Second, the church loses a great deal when incarnational theology is about anyone other than Jesus. God becoming man was an astounding and singular event. As Lewis commented, "It was the central event in the history of the Earth---the very thing that the whole story has been about."[^II-B-3a] When theologians speak of "incarnating" Christ, the sheer shock of the event fades. The focus shifts from the Son's work in humanity to the human response to the Son. The doctrine of the Incarnation above all ought to lead to worship. The people of God do not incarnate God the Son, but represent him in other ways. That does not negate the helpful instincts expressed in the incarnational theologizing of the last few years. It simply means that this doctrine can be expressed more accurately and helpfully.

[^II-B-3a]: _Miracles_, 131.

# III. Conclusion

Both the centrality of the Incarnation and its uniqueness are essential to healthy Christian theology, and therefore to healthy Christianity. Properly grasped, a robust doctrine of the Incarnation leads to greater worship and deeper future hope. Understood rightly, it leads to greater obedience to the gospel and the outworkings thereof in the world around the believer---not because the believer is somehow himself incarnating God, but because the Incarnation has resulted in radical transformation in the life of all those who believe. "Christ gives his sanctified humanity to us, so that we may partake of hi and his goodness.... God assumed our umanity in Jesus of Nazareth, healed our humanity with his own being, and gave our sanctified humanity back to us."[^III-1a] The Incarnation itself is an effective element of God's work in the life of believers, as the Spirit effects in human beings union with the Son who united humanity to the Godhead.
