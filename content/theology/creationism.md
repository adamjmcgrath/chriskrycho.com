As a friend of mine who characterizes himself as (and I quote) 'an empirical agnostic atheist' put it when talking about this:

> I would have a lot more respect for that group [Ken Ham and Anwers in Genesis] if they could just say "we believe that Earth is only a few thousand years old, and we recognize that our current scientific understanding strongly indicates otherwise, but at this time we just can't reconcile the discrepancy" instead of "secularist have hijacked science to mislead you into thinking Earth is older than it actually is".[^jerrad]
