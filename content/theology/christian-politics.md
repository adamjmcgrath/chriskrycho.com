Righteousness and wickedness are not mere abstractions, nor are they merely attitudes of the heart. They are ways of *acting*---most often toward the poor and needy, or toward orphans and widows. (Cf. Job, Psalms, Proverbs, and so on.)

- the urgency of Christians living *righteously*
- the nature of a righteous life
- the condemnation of rulers who do not *govern* righteously, esp. wrt. the treatment of the poor and needy
- the reality that in a democratic (republican) institution, *we* govern (by proxy if nothing else) and therefore are in some sense accountable for the enactment of just or unjust laws
- the necessity, therefore, of thoughtful Christian political engagement---not in a partisan sense, but always in the direction of *justice*, and always remembering that *well-intended* approaches may in fact *hurt* the cause of the oppressed if they are not *wise*.
- the reality that justice will never be perfected until *God* finishes it
- the reality that God is still enthroned and that there *will* be justice---this is one of the other major themes that often runs in parallel with the call to walk justly iurselves. God *does* reign, even now.
