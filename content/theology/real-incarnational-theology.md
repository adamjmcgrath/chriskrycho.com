## A Mistake

It has been common these past few years to speak of "incarnational theology" as a way of describing the Christian mission to the world: we ought to "incarnate" Christ to the world as Christ "incarnated" the Godhead to us.[^1] There is much to appreciate in this sentiment. It represents an appropriate recognition that humans are God's image-bearers. It pays heed to the New Testament's assertion that Christians are the body of and ambassadors for Christ. It takes seriously Paul's shocking language of "filling up what is lacking in the sufferings of Christ" (Colossians 1:24). It rightly points to the synthesis of missionary activity and social activism that represents the best of evangelicalism.

Yet for all that, I think that applying the language of incarnation to believers is a serious mistake. It is not that this way of speaking is wholly wrong but that it tends to blind us to the uniqueness of the Incarnation of Christ. God becoming man was an astounding event, a greater thing than any of our philosophers or poets had imagined. Thus Lewis wrote, "It was the central event in the history of the Earth---the very thing that the whole story has been about" (_Miracles_). When we speak of ourselves "incarnating" Christ, we begin to blur out the sheer shock of the event. When Jesus came, God was *here* with us, but now we stand in the time between the times, waiting for him because he is *not*---not as he was, and not as he will be.[^2] Worse yet, this sort of language tempts us turn our eyes to ourselves and away from the one we "incarnate". For Christ, becoming Incarnate was the ultimate act of humility. Can we say the same of our "incarnating" him?

Moreover, incarnational language misapplies the use of the body metaphor in Scripture. Whenever bodily language is used of the church, it points to the unity of the people of God, not to the evangelistic impulse. By contrast, when Jesus described the mission of the early church, it was as fishermen, or servants working in the absence of their master. Similarly, Paul's most prominent metaphor for evangelistic activity the ambassador or representative.

So we would do well to set aside the idea that we "incarnate" Christ for these kinds of negative reasons. Better to follow Scripture's own language for evangelism and say that we are Jesus' ambassadors and representatives. We do not incarnate him, because we cannot---the Incarnation was unique---but that does not negate the instincts of which the theology of the last few years has been an expression. It simply means that we need to do better in expressing those ideas.

It seems to me, though, that even more significant than these matters of words and meanings---important though they are---is how much we miss when our incarnational theology is about us instead of about Jesus, the son of Mary and the son of God.

## On the Incarnation

I have come to tears in a class only once in my life---a few weeks ago, listening to [my theology professor][mckinion] exult in what Christ did for us in the Incarnation. In evangelical churches, we often discuss Jesus' death on the cross, and sometimes his perfect life or his resurrection.[^3] Rarely, however, do we speak of the Incarnation. It gets a mention at Christmas---usually when we talk about how the Virgin Birth was necessary for the fulfillment of prophecy, one of many confirmations that Jesus was indeed the foretold Messiah.

But the Incarnation means more than this. It always has. That God became a man is bigger than paying for our sins---marvelous though that alone would be. The language is there throughout the whole New Testament. A few samples will do, but I could cite many more.

>     And you, child, will be called the prophet of the Most High;
>         for you will go before the Lord to prepare his ways,
>     to give knowledge of salvation to his people
>         in the forgiveness of their sins,
>     because of the tender mercy of our God,
>         whereby the sunrise shall visit us from on high
>     to give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death,
>         to guide our feet into the way of peace.”
>
> ---Luke 1:76--79

Zechariah's prophecy includes salvation from sin, yes, but it points to something more: an end to the power of death and the coming of peace. How does Christ's work accomplish those?

> But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to  become children of God, who were born, not of blood nor of the will of the  flesh nor of the will of man, but of God.
>
> And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth. (John bore witness about him, and cried out, "This was he of whom I said, 'He who comes after me ranks before me, because he was before me.'") For from his fullness we have all received, grace upon grace. For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. No one has ever seen God; the only God, who is at the Father's side, he has made him known.
>
> ---John 1:11--18

John's description of the Incarnation points to adoption, to our being children and heirs of God again. This was the state from which Adam and Eve fell; John couples the Incarnation of Christ---not his death or resurrection, but his becoming flesh---to our becoming children of God once again.

> For in him the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily, and you have been filled in him, who is the head of all rule and authority.
>
> ---Colossians 2:9--10

Paul goes on in Colossians to talk of the penal substitutionary aspect of Christ's work in very definite terms---but he starts here by showing how we are filled in Christ even as the "whole fullness" (what a phrase!) of deity dwells in him.

> Since therefore the children share in flesh and blood, he himself likewise partook of the same things, that through death he might destroy the one who has the power of death, that is, the devil, and deliver all those who through fear of death were subject to lifelong slavery. For surely it is not angels that he helps, but he helps the offspring of Abraham. Therefore he had to be made like his brothers in every respect, so that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people. For because he himself has suffered when tempted, he is able to help those who are being tempted.
> 
> ---Hebrews 2:14--18

Hebrews shows us Jesus as propitiation for our sins---hallelujah!---and it *also* shows us his help for us because he has suffered under temptation just as we have. More: his death delivers us not only from the penalty from sin, but also from death (not to mention destroying the devil).

We could go on, and on, and on. The incarnation matters, and it matters as more than a means of getting Jesus to the cross so that he could die for our sins. Too often, we evangelicals reduce everything to penal substitutionary atonement. The atonement is incredible. It is amazing. It is one of the central affirmations and joys of the Christian faith: our sins are paid for! Glory to God! But Jesus did more than that, and he is worthy of more praise. He did not stop at paying the price for our sins and leaving our bodies subject to corruption. He did not content himself with performing a judicial act while leaving our wills broken and certain to turn again to the same follies that led to our death and debt in the first place.

Redemption is not less than substitutionary atonement, to be sure---but it is much, much more. Redemption is the forgiveness of sins. Redemption is the cleansing from unrighteousness---not only from its guilt, but from its corrupting stain on our souls. Redemption is our wills being unchained from the power of sin. Redemption is partaking in the divine nature. Redemption is resurrection from the dead---not a rescuscitation from which we will only die again, but being raised to immortality. Redemption is the mending of our communion one with another. Above all, redemption is the restoration of fellowship with God. Jesus took up our flesh that he might unite humanity once again with the Triune Godhead. As we were in the beginning, so shall we be again---but better.

Redemption began with and was accomplished through the Incarnation no less than in Jesus' life (which is part and parcel of it) or his death (which was both impossible and meaningless without it) or his resurrection (which completes it).

Saint Athanasius said it best long ago:

> For being Word of the Father, and above all, He alone of natural fitness was both able to recreate everything, and worthy to suffer on behalf of all and to be ambassador for all with the Father....
>
> He took pity on our race, and had mercy on our infirmity, and condescended to our corruption, and, unable to bear that death should have the mastery--- lest the creature should perish, and His Father's handiwork in men be spent for naught--- He takes unto Himself a body, and that of no different sort from ours....
>
> And thus taking from our bodies one of like nature, because all were under penalty of the corruption of death He gave it over to death in the stead of all, and offered it to the Father— doing this, moreover, of His loving-kindness, to the end that, firstly, all being held to have died in Him, the law involving the ruin of men might be undone (inasmuch as its power was fully spent in the Lord's body, and had no longer holding-ground against men, his peers), and that, secondly, whereas men had turned toward corruption, He might turn them again toward incorruption, and quicken them from death by the appropriation of His body and by the grace of the Resurrection, banishing death from them like straw from the fire.
>
> ---Saint Athanasius, _On the Incarnation_

We have been transformed from guilt to innocence, from folly to wisdom, from wickedness to righteousness, from common to holy, from slaves to free, from debtors to heirs, from death to life. And without the Incarnation, we have *none* of that. If Christ did not take up and unite with his divinity every corner of what it is to be human, we remain guilty, foolish, wicked, common, enslaved, indebted, dead. With it, we have everything---God with us forever. Christ's work advanced through his sinless life, culminated in his death, and climaxed in his resurrection---but it began in the Incarnation.

Thanks be to God.

If you have not read Athanasius' _On the Incarnation_, you should. It is one of the most important books in the history of the church, and therefore in the history of the world. It is also short. Do yourself the great favor of [getting a copy][oti] and reading it well. For my part, I have made a commitment to read it on March 25---the day on which the church has traditionally celebrated the Annunciation of Christ to Mary---every year for the rest of my life. I think it is that important.
