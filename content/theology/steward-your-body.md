We have about 80 years on this planet. Those of us who live longer might see 90 or even 100. For someone like me, in my mid-20s, it is easy to overlook the reality that the next 60--70 years will pass quickly, but they will. (Truth be told, it is getting harder to ignore that reality with every passing day, but that is a post for another day.) One major question that confronts us as we consider the brevity of our lives is how we will spend the *last* twenty to thirty years of our lives. Assuming that we want to spend them well, we have another question to ask: *Will we be _able_ to?*

For too many people who hit their sixties and seventies, the answer is sadly *no*.
