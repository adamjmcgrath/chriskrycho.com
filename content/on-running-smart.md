I run a lot. You [may have noticed][rk]. I also run pretty quickly, all things considered---at the time of writing, my half marathon PR is under 1:30 and I'm shooting for a 1:27 or better this year. That's a long way from a world record time,[^world] and it's not even competitive in any decent sized race[^cityofoaks]. My daily runs are usually in the 7:10--7:20/mile range. That's also not an astoundingly fast time in the scheme of runners. But it's pretty quick for your run-of-the-mill runner, and that's exactly what I am. I am not naturally athletic---just ask my high school football coaches. I am not tall and lanky. I have exactly and only two things going for me: I run smart, and I keep at it. In this guide, I will tell you everything I've learned about running smart, in the hopes that it will help you keep at it, too.

Before I say anything else, I think it is worth belaboring this point. You can run as hard as you want, and make less progress on every front than someone running less and easier but *smarter*. My goal in running is not to feel a sense of accomplishment-via-pain, or on the other to get the so-called runner's high. (I think I have had one runner's high ever. Maybe.) My goals instead are to run in a way that lets me keep running, and that I enjoy. I exercise because I want to be fit and healthy, but I *run* because I enjoy that.

Part of "running smart" is not running if you absolutely hate running. You have to give it a fair go the way I'm about to outline before you decide that, mind. Many people hate running because they have only ever run in ways that are anything but smart. When running always means fatigue and pain and at best a short burst of counterbalancing emotional energy from the "high", it is no wonder most people hate running. But I do not have that experience. When I run, I am rarely tired and almost never hurting. (Indeed: the way I train, pain usually means I am doing something *wrong*. More on that below.)

Buckle up. This is going to cover a lot of ground. If you want to break it into multiple reads, there are three big sections below. Before we get there, though, I want to lay out *my* goals for running:

1. *Be healthy.* I have watched various people in my family, and plenty of friends, struggle with health and weight and especially the combination of the two over the years. I would like to avoid the health problems that come with being overweight, and I want my body to continue working well over the course of however many years God gives me.

    This affects my goals for running in two ways. On the one hand, running is a good way of *staying fit*. It helps me keep my weight at healthy levels, boosts my energy levels and generally provides lots of benefits. On the other hand, it determines *how* I run. I am not interested in running in ways that are ultimately deleterious to my body. I want to run in ways that are helpful in the long term, not harmful.

2. *Improve over time.* I want to get better at running over time. I am faster now than I was a year ago, and I hope to be a little faster a year from now. I would love to break a 1:20 half marathon some day, even though that seems crazy fast right now. I want personal records (PRs) that improve over the course of my life.

3. *Stick with it.* Sustainability is a huge concern for me. Again, I have watched friends and family do the on-again-off-again dance not only with various diets but with various exercise routines over the years, and I want to avoid that see-saw. I need my approach to fitness and exercise to be something I can do consistently, and which I can stick with for years.

    That means two things: my fitness needs to be something I *can* continue doing in the long term physically speaking, and my fitness needs to be something I *enjoy*. Neither of those are negotiables for sustainable patterns of exercise. Among other things, that means that if, despite your best efforts to run smart as I outline below, you hate running, *you should go find some other kind of exercise to stay fit*. Running is not magical, and I place no particular value on running. Cycling, Zumba, ballroom dancing, playing pickup basketball at the gym, lifting weights: it does not matter what your thing is as long as it is healthy and sustainable. Just pick a thing. Mine is running.

4. *I run half marathons.* My training plan is very specifically built around that. I will talk a lot of general principles, but there are also things about the distance for which I am training that affect the specific things I do.
 
I clarify those goals because our goals may not be the same. Yours may be racing in the Olympics, in which case go find a good coach and stop reading this blog; it's a pointless waste of time. Or it may be to supplement your existing exercise regime, in which case some of the things I say below won't apply directly, but a lot of the principles may be helpful. You may not want to run half marathons, and care about 5Ks or shorter races instead. All of those are fine; just be aware that everything I say is filtered through those three goals above.

One last, incredibly important qualifer: *everyone is different*. I have found the following to work very, very well... for me. Similar training habits have also worked well for a lot of other people, including world-class athletes. But they do not work, at least not in exactly the same ways, for everyone. Give it a fair shot---a *really* fair shot; we're talking 3--6 months, not a few weeks---before you say it doesn't work for you. But it might not.

Now, let's get down to it.

## My Method

My method itself is super simple; it has just three big points. I'll go into great detail about each of these later, but for now, I'll explain the method itself as simply as possible.

1. Run slow.
    
    - Buy a HRM.
    - Use this formula to calculate your maximum aerobic heart rate. For the next three months, don't go faster than you can go to maintain that heart rate---period.
    - Run 3--4 times a week if you're just starting. (If you're already doing that many or more, you can run as you like. Just don't overdo it.)
    - Spend at least half an hour each of the days you're running. One day a week, run longer---start with 45 minutes and work up till you're able to do and hour and a half or two hours.
    - Once you've done that for three months, you get to add the following workouts to the list:
		* Tempo runs: go out for a medium-length run (whatever that means for you), and do the first half at that easy heart rate, and the last half hard and fast.
		* Speed work: go to a track and do 400-meter repeats. 
    
2. Run consistently.
3. Stop running sometimes.

## Run Slow

This is the biggest surprise to most people, and the biggest difference in how I run from how most people I know come at running. I run slow.

Now, I know you may be looking at the times I posted above and thinking, "You're ridiculous. Those times are anything but slow." But here's the thing: I got to those times by running slow---much slower than those times---and they're still not my running fast. They're not what most people think of when they go running: pushing the whole time, being out of breath, feeling wiped out when finished. When I go out for a run and pull down 7:15/mile, I am never out of breath and I feel refreshed rather than tired at the end. I am running "slow" for me; my body could (and does, when I push it) run much faster.

Here is the trick: every day when I go running, I strap on a heart rate monitor. I have learned what my maximum aerobic heart rate is, and I don't run any faster than I can sustain that heart rate. As soon as I go over it, I slow down. I have been doing this for almost four years now, and it has paid major dividends.

When I switched to this training method, I had spent 8 months working as hard as I could at running.[^mono] Four times a week, I would go knock out 3--5 miles. I could, on a good day, hammer out 3 miles at about a 7-minute pace, or 5 miles at an 8-minute pace. After doing that, I was beat (you know the feeling if you've ever gone out and just run hard until you can't keep going). Within a few months of switching, I was running 8-minute miles for 14 miles and not even feeling tired afterward. It felt like magic.

There's a catch, of course---but don't worry, I already told you. You get to go *slow* for a while. When I first switched to this kind of aerobic base training style, I was running 11-minute miles to keep my heart rate that low. It took months for my pace to start really dropping, and it has taken years for it to get down as far as it is now. But this is the key, the reason I don't feel tired and don't get out of breath: my body just isn't working that hard, because it's processing energy effectively. Where I used to be barely able to run 3 miles at a 7 minute-per-mile pace, now I can sustain that without getting tired for 8--10 miles.

You can do the same. You may start slower, or end up faster than me. But you can do the same. So how does this work?

### Aerobic and Anaerobic Respiration

Science time! The way most of us learned to run, and the way most of us still run most of the time, only uses *part* of the human body's natural capacity for processing energy, and it's what I would describe as the more-powerful-but-less-efficient part. There are two basic ways your body burns energy, which are called "aerobic" and "anaerobic" by those in the know. There is a lot to this, so I will give you the short version:

[the short version goes here]

My entire training plan is built around the idea of building up an ever-increasing capacity for aerobic exercise. Helpfully, your body is *really good* at that. Even if you're not a world-class athlete (and I am not), you can build a really solid base of aerobic fitness, because the human body is phenomenally well designed for just that.

### Maffetone's Magical Math

Now, even though I titled this section "Maffetone's Magical Math," the reality is that the formula is a good tool, but it actually *isn't* magical. Depending on other factors in your body type and your conditioning, your peak aerobic heart rate may be higher or lower than the formula suggests. You can go pay substantial sums of money to get that tested, and under certain circumstances, that might even be valuable. For my purposes, though, the Maffetone formula works well and has always been in the *good enough* zone.

## Run Consistently

This approach---and really, *any* approach to health and fitness---only works if you do it consistently. Indeed, the most important aspect of your  health in general is simply consistency. If you eat badly consistently, your body will work worse; if you eat well consistently, your body will work better. If you go in spurts---as the typical American dieter does---your net results will probably be *worse* than if you simply ate poorly but consistently. The same is true of exercise: exercising consistently, even for a short time, is far more important than exercising hard every once in a while.

Long-distance running is a helpful analogy for this reality, even as it also demonstrates it. If you try to finish a half marathon by sprinting until out of breath, walking to recover, and repeating, you will almost certainly fail.[^sprinting]  If you go out at a manageable pace and keep at it, you will probably succeed. Training for the race (and training for fitness in general) is th esame. If you go out and hammer yourself into the ground for an hour and a half two days a week, you will be far less healthy and far less fit than if you go out and do an easy workout for half an hour four or five days a week. Fitness and health are about consistency far more than they are about intensity. (You'll note that this reality is essentially the basis of the aerobic fitness issue I outlined above!)

So at a practical level, this means that you should pick a reasonable goal for your exercise time, something you can sustain, and then stick with it. Most of my runs are just thirty to forty minutes long, and I do that five days a week. One day in the week, I go out for a long run which takes me an hour and a half to two hours. And I do this every week.[^pause] During my most intense training times of the year, I will switch out one of those for a run that's about an hour long and more intense, but the vast majority of the time I don't go longer than forty-five minutes or shorter than thirty minutes, and I run most days in the week.

When just starting out, you probably shouldn't run six days a week. Three or four is a good place to start. Just go do those three or four days  every single week, and you will get better at running, even if you aren't training as wisely as you could be.

[^sprinting]: If someone has done this and succeeded, I would be curious to hear about the undoubtedly painful process. I cannot imagine *why* anyone would try such a thing, though.

[^pause]: Though: see below on *stopping* sometimes.

## Stop Running Sometimes

Sometimes, the most helpful thing you can do is rest. I mean this in three ways. First, you need sleep if you want to be healthy, period---and this necessarily includes the desire to be fit. I run *much* better on 7--8 hours of sleep than I do on 5--6. Everyone's sleep needs are different, but if you don't sleep well, you won't run well. Nor will you do much of anything else well. In fact, sleeping well is one of the most important things you can do for your health. You will get sick less, have more energy, be more alert, and probably live longer if you sleep enough than if you don't. Certainly you will be able to run better.

The second part of this is that you will find your body worn out sometimes. Don't be afraid to take a day off. Consistency still matters, so don't make a *habit* of taking days off just because you don't feel like it. Be disciplined and stick with your plan. But when you are sick, or roll your ankle, or simply hit that point where your body is complaining in ways that let you know something is *wrong*---not just tired, but wrong---then stop. You are far better off giving yourself a chance to recover from sickness or injury than trying to press through and making it worse. You are better off doing a little preventative work to keep from getting injured when you have been overdoing it than actually injuring yourself and having to go through a recovery time. So aim to balance your pursuit of consistency with a recognition of your body's limits. Remember that you want to be able to use your body in thirty years, not just today.

This leads to my third point here: cross train---do other kinds of exercise besides running. (Confession: I have not been good at this, and am only now starting to find ways to do better at it!) Running is hard on the joints, especially if you're out on hard roads or sidewalks the majority of the time. If you only run, and you run a lot of miles, you will eventually wear out your knees. It is incredibly helpful to do a variety of other activities to help balance that out. Cycling and swimming are both good aerobic activities you can use as substitutes for running which will help with your general fitness *and* take the load off your joints. You will also want to do some weight training, and not just for your lower body. Keeping a strong core, arms, shoulders, and chest will help more than you might think with running. (And as I have recently discovered, you'll need all of those and then some for swimming!)

[^world]: It's [58:23](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half_marathon#World_record_progression) at present---Eritrean runner Zersenay Tadese was running 4:48/mile on average to pull that off. That's two whole minutes per mile faster than me: I was running 6:47/mile when I got my best time.

[^cityofoaks]: In the race where I PR'd last year, the Rex Healthcare Half Marathon (which is part of the [City of Oaks Marathon](http://www.cityofoaksmarathon.com) race event), the winner finished in 1:09:20---almost twenty minutes ahead of me, running 5:18/mile (90s per mile faster than me!). As an amusing aside: the*marathon* winner hit the 13.1-mile mark at 1:13:29: still a good fifteen minutes faster than me.
