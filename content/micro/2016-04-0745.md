If you want to Gmail to work the same as everything else in Apple Mail on iOS---deleting things, not archiving them---go to **Mail, Contacts, Calendars**, then the Gmail account, then **Account**, then **Advanced**, then set *Move discarded messages into* to **Deleted Mailbox**. Written up because I *always* forget.
