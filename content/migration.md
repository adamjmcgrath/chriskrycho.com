Description: I migrated to Pelican as a stopgap for migrating to my own generator.
Status: draft

I've been wanting to migrate to a static site generator for a while. I like flat
text files---that's where I do all my writing---and I have increasingly hated
WordPress. Though it is getting *prettier*, WordPress is not actually
functionally improving for the ordinary blogger right now.
[Ghost](http://ghost.org) looks super cool, but it doesn't give me the benefit
of flat files. So I started building [my own](http://step-stool.io). However,
life is busy and I haven't had time to finish it just yet, so I am temporarily
moving to [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com). Here I am documenting the
migration, both because I find it interesting and in the hopes that it may be
valuable to others.
