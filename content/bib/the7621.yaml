  abstract: 'The traditional premillennial view of Revelation has implications that
    are con- tradictory to the most straightforward interpretation of clearer passages
    in the NewTestament. These implications include: (1) the present earth will endure
    far beyond the return of Christ; (2) the unrighteous will not be judged when Christ
    returns; (3) natural bodies will be present during the millennium; and (4) people
    will have the opportunity to receive salvation during the millennium. The most
    straightforward interpretation of texts surveyed to disprove these premillennial
    implications must be rejected by Premillennialists in favour of the more obscure
    and enigmatic text of Revelation 20. But in rejecting the straightforward reading
    of these texts, Premillennialists are also rejecting two key principles of herme-
    neutics: (1) the more obscure passages should be interpreted in light of clearer
    passages and (2) the interpretation that is consistent with the greater amount
    of biblical support should be favoured.'
