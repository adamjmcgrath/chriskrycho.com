## Life

- We're about to move to Colorado---probably heading out from North Carolina in mid to late October. We're buying a ridiculously amazing house on a ridiculously amazing lot: literally a mountain lake house in the foothills of the Front Range in Monument, Colorado.
- We got to see totality in the 2017 total solar eclipse! It was the most amazing thing I've ever seen.
- I'm training for a full marathon ([City of Oaks](http://cityofoaksmarathon.com), at which I've run the half marathon event 3 of the 4 years we've lived here). Mileage is getting there, but given the move I'm currently not sure I'll actually be able to participate.

## Podcasts

I have so many of them.

- [New Rustacean](http://www.newrustacean.com) -- a podcast about learning the Rust programming languare. Updates 2--3â¨‰ each month.
- [Winning Slowly](http://www.winningslowly.org) -- taking the long view on technology, religion, ethics, and art; cohosted with [Stephen Carradini](http://stephencarradini.com). Usually updates biweekly; we've been in flux with Stephen finishing a Ph.D., his wife delivering their first baby, and their all moving from North Carolina to Arizona in the course of 2017. Getting back on the normal schedule this fall.
- [Mass Affection](https://www.massaffection.com) -- playing through the _Mass Effect_ with my wife. I've got two episodes we need to publish. We got distracted with things besides video games this summer, but we'll be back at it.

## Projects

- My main task right now is trying to make the experience of writing TypeScript and Ember.js awesome. [typed-ember](https://github.com/typed-ember) on GitHub is where all the action is at. I've also been writing a series of blog posts, ["Typing Your Ember"](http://www.chriskrycho.com/typing-your-ember/), to help people get off the ground.
- I'm keeping track of my reading this year via my [2017 book list](http://www.chriskrycho.com/2017-book-list.html). One of my goals is, for new books I read, to write at least a *short* review of them.

### On Hold

- [lightning.rs](https://github.com/chriskrycho/lightning-rs/) -- my static site generator project in Rust, basically tabled until I finish bootstrapping the TypeScript/Ember.js ecosystem.
- [Rust and Swift](http://www.chriskrycho.com/rust-and-swift.html) -- I tabled this to work on a project of the same focus for O'Reilly, who ended up canceling the project. I'm not sure I'll ever go back to it. I was really enjoying it, but that really burned me out, and in the meantime both Swift and Rust have moved on, a *lot*.

## Career

- I finished my M. Div. in May 2017. *Finally.*
- I also went full-time at Olo at the same time. I'm now a Senior Software Engineer focused on making the experience of ordering food online as amazing as it can be. (We have a long way to go!)
