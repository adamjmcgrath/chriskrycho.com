Last week, software tools developer Jetbrains announced their intent to drop permanent licenses entirely in favor of a subscription model. In the new approach, users could pay a lower price than the previous annual upgrade fee to get access to the same software. JetBrains also introduced a bundle to let users get access to all of their tools at a *much* lower price than it would have taken to buy them all together. So far so good; but they also introduced a wrinkle familiar to users of other subscription model software: if the user stops paying, the tools stop working.

To put it mildly, this caused some serious backlash---and rightly so.

They've since promised to revisit the decision, in light of the quick and loud backlash against their annoucement. Thus, this is not so much directed at JetBrains as it is taking their announcement---just the latest such in a long string that includes far larger software developers like Adobe and Microsoft---to discuss the advent of subscription-based business models for discrete software applications.

There are many reasons why these models look attractive to software vendors, and they can actually provide a lot of benefits to consumers as well. However, there are several problems with the subscription model as implemented by most vendors today:

  - They provide clear value to the software creator, but are generally neutral at best for users.
  - They conflate two distinct responses from users: wanting to use the app, and wanting the particular upgrades you're offering at any given time.
  - They mix up the business models appropriate to *services* and *applications* respectively.

These problems affect consumers of the software product first, but in the long run, they will hurt the vendors, too.
