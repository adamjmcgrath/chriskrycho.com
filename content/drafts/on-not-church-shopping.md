As we are preparing to move across the country, we have started looking at churches in the town we are moving to. There are several healthy[^1] evangelical churches in the area, and we have our theological and methodological convictions and commitments that limit the scope somewhat. I could list them out. But one of my major concerns as we go is this: *church-shopping is perverse.*

Here's what I mean by that: the idea of "shopping" for a church (and indeed the very phrase) entails a twisted understanding of our relationship to the church. It makes us [consumers of the church's goods][1], rather than humble recipients of the grace God has given by uniting us to his people. We treat the church as a means of self-actualization or self-satisfaction rather than a gift. We come to think of the choice of church like the choice between house designs or neighborhoods. But the church is not a house design or a neighborhood; she is the living bride of Christ.

And this is, again, *perverse*. It is a corruption and a distortion of the relationship we ought to have to God's people. We are not meant to be judges standing over congregations, evaluating them as to their "fit" with our preferences (even our methodological and theological preferences; though more on that in a moment). We are meant to seek the face of the living God together, to serve each other in Christ-like humility, laying down our preferences and our tastes for each other's good. And choosing a church by way of evaluations of preferences and positives and negatives leads us inexorably that way.

That's a lot of rhetorical flourish; let's bring it down to our own experience as believers. My wife and I, having identified the town we wanted to live in, started looking around for resources to help us choose a church. In and of itself, this is not *inherently* a problem:[^2] we are responsible for the discipling of our children and for our own maturation and fruit in the faith, and we would be fools to join a church which does not preach the gospel. But now we are confronted with this challenge: there are (at least) four healthy-seeming, broadly Reformed, broadly evangelical churches in the area: [EVFA][2], [SBC][3], [PCA][4], and [ACNA][5]. Each is certain to do some things better and other things worse than each of the others. At the least defensible level: the musical and preaching styles in some of them will be less to our taste and likely even of a lower quality than in others. More defensibly, it is nearly certain that their methodological and theological approaches will be more or less in line with our own convictionsâ€”and at least some of those convictions are significant.

But when we go to choose

- Confessionalism
- Denominations
- History: 

Where once we might have had some sense that we were bound by our confession and had a responsibility to live as faithful Presbyterians or Baptists, our fractured ecclesial context means this kind of identity is hardly open to us anymore. And insofar as it is, it is open to us only as a self-conscious choice---a choice we certainly should make; but the fact that it is a choice we must make rather than the norm by which we are points again to the structural nature of this problem. As I have [written elsewhere][6]: "struggle as i may / i cannot escape my / modernity / for even the attempt / is but another symptom": the act of *choosing* to submit to the authority of the church is good, but it is only possible in a situation that is deeply bad.

[^1]:	or at least healthy-*seeming;* it is difficult to truly evaluate a church from a thousand miles away

[^2]:	It is worth note, though, that it inheres in something which *is* a problem: the very fact of our hyper-fractured church culture. More on this below as well.
