Something I have been thinking about a great deal recently: Why, exactly, have I found myself in a spot where theological writing is (nearly always) *hard work*---when it used to come so easily? The short answer, but not at all for the reasons you might think, is: seminary.

For the last four and a half years, I have been a student at Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary, with all that entails. I have studied everything from biblical languages to church history and from missiology to philosophy of science. Finishing the M. Div. has been *hard* for me---not academically, but nearly quite precisely because of its lack of academic rigor. (The length is something, too: 90 hours of course-work, or 30 classes, is no joke.)
