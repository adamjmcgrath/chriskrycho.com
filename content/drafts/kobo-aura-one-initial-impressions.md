Positives:

- Screen is gorgeous
- The siaze is absolutely perfect
- Color-shifting backlight at night was quite nice, though I may look to tweak *how* orange it gets
- Calibre for externally-sourced ePubs FTW (HT: Jason Snell/Six Colors)
- Screensaver is *nice*.
- Power on off quickly is *nice*.
- Battery life is pethaps slightly worse than my Kindle, but it had been plenty long enough

Negatives:

- notetaking and highlighting
	- selections are finicky
	- input is about as bad as on the Kindle
	- extracting notes requires a special tool!
