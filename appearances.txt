    > **"Tolle Lege!: Designing Readable Bibles with Digital Typography"**
    > 
    > The Bible has always been a challenging text to display, whether copied by
    > hand or printed on a Gutenberg press, and the task has only grown more
    > complicated in the era of digital text. The challenges are not
    > insurmountable, though. We have the tools to solve them: the principles of
    > good typography, especially careful page design and the deliberate choice
    > and skillful use of appropriate typefaces (fonts). When we apply those
    > principles to the Scripturesâ€”whether in an app or on the web---we can
    > provide people with digital Bibles that are both readable and beautiful.
